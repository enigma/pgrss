But it seemed worth spoiling the atmosphere if I could\nsave some of the startups from\npreventable deaths.  So at the last minute I cooked up this rather\ngrim talk.  I didn't mean this as an essay; I wrote it down\nbecause I only had two hours before dinner and think fastest while\nwriting.)\n</i><br/><br/>A couple days ago I told a reporter that we expected about a third\nof the companies we funded to succeed.  Actually I was being\nconservative.  I'm hoping it might be as much as a half.  Wouldn't\nit be amazing if we could achieve a 50% success rate?<br/><br/>Another way of saying that is that half of you are going to die.  Phrased\nthat way, it doesn't sound good at all.  In fact, it's kind of weird\nwhen you think about it, because our definition of success is that\nthe founders get rich.  If half the startups we fund succeed, then\nhalf of you are going to get rich and the other half are going to\nget nothing.<br/><br/>If you can just avoid dying, you get rich.  That sounds like a joke,\nbut it's actually a pretty good description of what happens in a\ntypical startup.  It certainly describes what happened in Viaweb.\nWe avoided dying till we got rich.<br/><br/>It was really close, too.  When we were visiting Yahoo to talk about\nbeing acquired, we had to interrupt everything and borrow one of\ntheir conference rooms to talk down an investor who was about to\nback out of a new funding round we needed to stay alive.   So even\nin the middle of getting rich we were fighting off the grim reaper.<br/><br/>You may have heard that quote about luck consisting of opportunity\nmeeting preparation.  You've now done the preparation.  The work\nyou've done so far has, in effect, put you in a position to get\nlucky: you can now get rich by not letting your company die.  That's\nmore than most people have.  So let's talk about how not to die.<br/><br/>We've done this five times now, and we've seen a bunch of startups\ndie.  About 10 of them so far.  We don't know exactly what happens\nwhen they die, because they generally don't die loudly and heroically.\nMostly they crawl off somewhere and die.<br/><br/>For us the main indication of impending doom is when we don't hear\nfrom you.  When we haven't heard from, or about, a startup for a\ncouple months, that's a bad sign.  If we send them an email asking\nwhat's up, and they don't reply, that's a really bad sign.  So far\nthat is a 100% accurate predictor of death.<br/><br/>Whereas if a startup regularly does new deals and releases and\neither sends us mail or shows up at YC events, they're probably\ngoing to live.<br/><br/>I realize this will sound naive, but maybe the linkage works in\nboth directions.  Maybe if you can arrange that we keep hearing\nfrom you, you won't die.<br/><br/>That may not be so naive as it sounds.  You've probably noticed\nthat having dinners every Tuesday with us and the other founders\ncauses you to get more done than you would otherwise, because every\ndinner is a mini Demo Day.  Every dinner is a kind of a deadline.\nSo the mere constraint of staying in regular contact with us will\npush you to make things happen, because otherwise you'll be embarrassed\nto tell us that you haven't done anything new since the last time\nwe talked.<br/><br/>If this works, it would be an amazing hack.  It would be pretty\ncool if merely by staying in regular contact with us you could get\nrich.  It sounds crazy, but there's a good chance that would work.<br/><br/>A variant is to stay in touch with other YC-funded startups.  There\nis now a whole neighborhood of them in San Francisco.  If you move\nthere, the peer pressure that made you work harder all summer will\ncontinue to operate.<br/><br/>When startups die, the official cause of death is always either\nrunning out of money or a critical founder bailing.  Often the two\noccur simultaneously.  But I think the underlying cause is usually\nthat they've become demoralized.  You rarely hear of a startup\nthat's working around the clock doing deals and pumping out new\nfeatures, and dies because they can't pay their bills and their ISP\nunplugs their server.<br/><br/>Startups rarely die in mid keystroke.  So keep typing!<br/><br/>If so many startups get demoralized and fail when merely by hanging\non they could get rich, you have to assume that running a startup\ncan be demoralizing.  That is certainly true.  I've been there, and\nthat's why I've never done another startup.  The low points in a\nstartup are just unbelievably low.  I bet even Google had moments\nwhere things seemed hopeless.<br/><br/>Knowing that should help.  If you know it's going to feel terrible\nsometimes, then when it feels terrible you won't think \"ouch, this\nfeels terrible, I give up.\"  It feels that way for everyone.  And\nif you just hang on, things will probably get better.  The metaphor\npeople use to describe the way a startup feels is at least a roller\ncoaster and not drowning.  You don't just sink and sink; there are\nups after the downs.<br/><br/>Another feeling that seems alarming but is in fact normal in a\nstartup is the feeling that what you're doing isn't working.  The\nreason you can expect to feel this is that what you do probably\nwon't work.  Startups almost never get it right the first time.\nMuch more commonly you launch something, and no one cares.  Don't\nassume when this happens that you've failed.  That's normal for\nstartups.  But don't sit around doing nothing.  Iterate.<br/><br/>I like Paul Buchheit's suggestion of trying to make something that\nat least someone really loves.  As long as you've made something\nthat a few users are ecstatic about, you're on the right track.  It\nwill be good for your morale to have even a handful of users who\nreally love you, and startups run on morale.  But also it\nwill tell you what to focus on.  What is it about you that they\nlove?  Can you do more of that?  Where can you find more people who\nlove that sort of thing?  As long as you have some core of users\nwho love you, all you have to do is expand it.  It may take a while,\nbut as long as you keep plugging away, you'll win in the end.  Both\nBlogger and Delicious did that.  Both took years to succeed.  But\nboth began with a core of fanatically devoted users, and all Evan\nand Joshua had to do was grow that core incrementally.  \n<a href=\"http://wufoo.com\">Wufoo</a> is\non the same trajectory now.<br/><br/>So when you release something and it seems like no one cares, look\nmore closely.  Are there zero users who really love you, or is there\nat least some little group that does?  It's quite possible there\nwill be zero.  In that case, tweak your product and try again.\nEvery one of you is working on a space that contains at least one\nwinning permutation somewhere in it.  If you just keep trying,\nyou'll find it.<br/><br/>Let me mention some things not to do.  The number one thing not to\ndo is other things.  If you find yourself saying a sentence that\nends with \"but we're going to keep working on the startup,\" you are\nin big trouble.  Bob's going to grad school, but we're going to\nkeep working on the startup.  We're moving back to Minnesota, but\nwe're going to keep working on the startup.  We're taking on some\nconsulting projects, but we're going to keep working on the startup.\nYou may as well just translate these to \"we're giving up on the\nstartup, but we're not willing to admit that to ourselves,\" because\nthat's what it means most of the time.  A startup is so hard that\nworking on it can't be preceded by \"but.\"<br/><br/>In particular, don't go to graduate school, and don't start other\nprojects.  Distraction is fatal to startups.  Going to (or back to)\nschool is a huge predictor of death because in addition to the\ndistraction it gives you something to say you're doing.  If you're\nonly doing a startup, then if the startup fails, you fail.  If\nyou're in grad school and your startup fails, you can say later \"Oh\nyeah, we had this startup on the side when I was in grad school,\nbut it didn't go anywhere.\"<br/><br/>You can't use euphemisms like \"didn't go anywhere\" for something\nthat's your only occupation.  People won't let you.<br/><br/>One of the most interesting things we've discovered from working\non Y Combinator is that founders are more motivated by the fear of\nlooking bad than by the hope of getting millions of dollars.   So\nif you want to get millions of dollars, put yourself in a position\nwhere failure will be public and humiliating.<br/><br/>When we first met the founders of \n<a href=\"http://octopart.com\">Octopart</a>, they seemed very smart,\nbut not a great bet to succeed, because they didn't seem especially\ncommitted.  One of the two founders was still in grad school.  It\nwas the usual story: he'd drop out if it looked like the startup\nwas taking off.  Since then he has not only dropped out of grad\nschool, but appeared full length in \n<a href=\"http://docs.octopart.com/newsweek_octopart_small.jpg\">Newsweek</a> \nwith the word \"Billionaire\"\nprinted across his chest.  He just cannot fail now.  Everyone he\nknows has seen that picture.  Girls who dissed him in high school\nhave seen it.  His mom probably has it on the fridge.  It would be\nunthinkably humiliating to fail now.  At this point he is committed\nto fight to the death.<br/><br/>I wish every startup we funded could appear in a Newsweek article\ndescribing them as the next generation of billionaires, because\nthen none of them would be able to give up.  The success rate would\nbe 90%.  I'm not kidding.<br/><br/>When we first knew the Octoparts they were lighthearted, cheery\nguys.  Now when we talk to them they seem grimly determined.  The\nelectronic parts distributors are trying to squash them to keep\ntheir monopoly pricing.  (If it strikes you as odd that people still\norder electronic parts out of thick paper catalogs in 2007, there's\na reason for that.  The distributors want to prevent the transparency\nthat comes from having prices online.)  I feel kind of bad that\nwe've transformed these guys from lighthearted to grimly determined.\nBut that comes with the territory.  If a startup succeeds, you get\nmillions of dollars, and you don't get that kind of money just by\nasking for it.  You have to assume it takes some amount of pain.<br/><br/>And however tough things get for the Octoparts, I predict they'll\nsucceed.  They may have to morph themselves into something totally\ndifferent, but they won't just crawl off and die.  They're smart;\nthey're working in a promising field; and they just cannot give up.<br/><br/>All of you guys already have the first two.  You're all smart and\nworking on promising ideas.  Whether you end up among the living\nor the dead comes down to the third ingredient, not giving up.<br/><br/>So I'll tell you now: bad shit is coming.  It always is in a startup.\nThe odds of getting from launch to liquidity without some kind of\ndisaster happening are one in a thousand.  So don't get demoralized.\nWhen the disaster strikes, just say to yourself, ok, this was what\nPaul was talking about.  What did he say to do?  Oh, yeah.  Don't\ngive up.<br/><br/></br></p></font>","date":"2007-08-01T00:00:00Z"}
