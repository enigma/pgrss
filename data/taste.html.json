H. Hardy, <i>A Mathematician's Apology</i>\n</font>\n</td></tr></table>\n</td></tr></table><br/><br/>I was talking recently to a friend who teaches\nat MIT.  His field is hot now and\nevery year he is inundated by applications from\nwould-be graduate students.  \"A lot of them seem smart,\"\nhe said.  \"What I can't tell is whether they have any kind\nof taste.\"<br/><br/>Taste.  You don't hear that word much now.\nAnd yet we still need the underlying\nconcept, whatever we call it.  What my friend meant was\nthat he wanted students who were not just good technicians,\nbut who could use their technical knowledge to\ndesign beautiful things.<br/><br/>Mathematicians call good work \"beautiful,\"\nand so, either now or in the past, have\nscientists, engineers, musicians, architects, designers,\nwriters, and painters.\nIs it just a coincidence that they used the same word, or is   \nthere some overlap in what they meant?  If there\nis an overlap, can we use one field's discoveries\nabout beauty to help us in another?<br/><br/>For those of us who design things, these are not just\ntheoretical questions.  If there is such a thing as\nbeauty, we need to be able to recognize it.  We need\ngood taste to make good things.\nInstead of\ntreating beauty as an airy abstraction, to be either blathered\nabout or avoided depending on how one feels about airy\nabstractions, let's try considering it as a practical question:\n<i>how do you make good stuff?</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>If you mention taste nowadays, a lot of people will tell\nyou that \"taste is subjective.\"\nThey believe this because it really feels that\nway to them.  When they like something, they have no idea\nwhy.  It could be because it's beautiful, or because their\nmother had one, or because they saw a movie star with one\nin a magazine, or because they know it's expensive.\nTheir thoughts are a tangle of unexamined impulses.<br/><br/>Most of us are encouraged, as children, to leave this tangle\nunexamined.  If you make fun of your little brother for\ncoloring people green in his coloring book, your\nmother is likely to tell you something like \"you like to\ndo it your way and he likes to do it his way.\"<br/><br/>Your mother at this point is not trying to teach you\nimportant truths about aesthetics.  She's trying to get\nthe two of you to stop bickering.<br/><br/>Like many of the half-truths adults tell us, this one\ncontradicts other things they tell us.  After dinning\ninto you that taste is merely a matter of personal preference,\nthey take you to the museum and tell you that you should\npay attention because Leonardo is a great artist.<br/><br/>What goes through the kid's head at this point?  What does\nhe think \"great artist\" means?  After having been\ntold for years that everyone just likes to do\nthings their own way, he is\nunlikely to head straight for the conclusion that a great\nartist is someone whose work is <i>better</i> than the others'.\nA far more likely theory, in his Ptolemaic model of\nthe universe, is that a great artist is something that's\ngood for you, like broccoli, because someone said so in a book.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Saying that taste is just personal preference is a good way\nto prevent disputes.  The trouble is, it's not true.\nYou feel this when you start to design things.<br/><br/>Whatever job people do, they naturally want to do better.\nFootball players\nlike to win games.  CEOs like to increase earnings.  It's\na matter of pride, and a real pleasure, to get better at\nyour job. But if\nyour job is to design things, and there is no such thing\nas beauty, then there is <i>no way to get better at your job.</i>\nIf taste is just personal preference, then everyone's is   \nalready perfect: you like whatever you like, and that's it.<br/><br/>As in any job, as you continue to design things, you'll get\nbetter at it.  Your tastes will change.  And, like anyone\nwho gets better at their job, you'll know you're getting\nbetter.  If so,\nyour old tastes were\nnot merely different, but worse.  Poof goes the axiom that\ntaste can't be wrong.<br/><br/>Relativism is fashionable at the moment, and that may hamper\nyou from thinking about taste, even as yours grows.\nBut if you come out of the closet and admit, at least to yourself,\nthat there is such a thing as good and bad design, then you\ncan start to study good design in detail.\nHow has\nyour taste changed?  When you made mistakes, what\ncaused you to make them?  What have other people learned about\ndesign?<br/><br/>Once you start to examine the question, it's surprising how\nmuch different fields' ideas of beauty have in common.  The same\nprinciples of good design crop up again and again.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Good design is simple.</b>  You hear this from math to\npainting.  In math it means that a shorter proof tends to be\na better one.  Where axioms are concerned, especially,\nless is more.  It means much the same thing in programming.\nFor architects and designers it means that beauty should\ndepend on a few carefully chosen structural elements\nrather than a profusion of superficial ornament.  (Ornament\nis not in itself bad, only when it's camouflage on insipid\nform.)  Similarly, in painting, a\nstill life of a few carefully observed and solidly\nmodelled objects will tend to be more interesting than a\nstretch of flashy\nbut mindlessly repetitive painting of, say, a lace collar.\nIn writing it means: say what you mean\nand say it briefly.<br/><br/>It seems strange to have to emphasize simplicity.\nYou'd think simple would be the default.  Ornate\nis more work.  But something seems to come over people\nwhen they try to be creative.  Beginning writers adopt   \na pompous tone that doesn't sound anything like the way \nthey speak.  Designers trying to be artistic resort to\nswooshes and curlicues.  Painters discover that they're expressionists.\nIt's all evasion.\nUnderneath\nthe long words or the \"expressive\" brush strokes, there\nis not much going on, and that's frightening.<br/><br/>When you're\nforced to be simple, you're forced to face the real problem.\nWhen you can't deliver ornament, you have to deliver\nsubstance.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Good design is timeless.</b>\nIn math, every proof is timeless unless it contains a mistake.\nSo what does Hardy mean when he says there is no permanent \nplace for ugly mathematics?  He means the same thing Kelly Johnson did:\nif something is ugly, it can't be the best solution.  There\nmust be a better one, and eventually\nsomeone will discover it.<br/><br/>Aiming at timelessness is a way to make\nyourself find the best answer:\nif you can imagine someone surpassing you, you should do it yourself.\nSome of the greatest masters did this so well that they\nleft little room for those who came after.\nEvery engraver since Durer has had to live in his shadow.<br/><br/>Aiming at timelessness is also a way to evade\nthe grip of fashion.  Fashions almost by definition\nchange with time, so if you can make something that\nwill still look good far into the future, then its\nappeal must derive more from merit and less from fashion.<br/><br/>Strangely enough, if you want to make something that will \nappeal to future generations, one way to do it is to\ntry to appeal to past generations.  It's hard to guess what\nthe future will be like, but we can be sure it will be\nlike the past in caring nothing for present fashions.\nSo if you can make something that appeals to people today\nand would also have appealed to people in 1500, there is a good\nchance it will appeal to people in 2500.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Good design solves the right problem.</b> The typical\nstove has four burners arranged in a square, and a dial\nto control each.  How do you arrange the dials?  The\nsimplest answer is to put them in a row.  But this is a\nsimple answer to the wrong question.\nThe dials are for humans to use, and if you put them in a row,\nthe unlucky human will have to stop and think each time\nabout which dial matches which burner.  Better to arrange the dials\nin a square like the burners.<br/><br/>A lot of bad design is industrious, but misguided.\nIn the mid twentieth century there was a vogue for\nsetting text in sans-serif fonts.\nThese fonts <i>are</i> closer to the pure, underlying letterforms.\nBut in text that's not the problem you're trying to solve. \nFor legibility it's more important that letters be easy\nto tell apart.\nIt may look Victorian, but a Times Roman lowercase g is\neasy to tell from a lowercase y.<br/><br/>Problems can be improved as well as solutions.\nIn software, an intractable problem can usually be replaced\nby an equivalent one that's easy to solve.\nPhysics progressed faster as the problem became\npredicting observable behavior, instead of reconciling it\nwith scripture.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Good design is suggestive.</b>\nJane Austen's novels contain almost no\ndescription; instead of telling you how\neverything looks, she tells her story so well that you   \nenvision the scene for yourself.\nLikewise, a painting that suggests is usually more engaging\nthan one that tells.  Everyone makes up their own story about the\nMona Lisa.<br/><br/>In architecture and design, this\nprinciple means that a building or object should let you \nuse it how you want: a good building, for example, will\nserve as a backdrop for whatever life people want to lead in it, instead\nof making them live as if they were executing a program\nwritten by the architect.<br/><br/>In software, it means you should give users a few\nbasic elements that they can combine as they wish, like Lego. \nIn math it means a proof that\nbecomes the basis for a lot of new work is\npreferable to a proof that was difficult,\nbut doesn't lead to future discoveries; in the\nsciences generally, citation is considered a rough\nindicator of merit.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Good design is often slightly funny.</b>  This one\nmay not always be true.  But Durer's \n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/pilate.html\">engravings</a>\nand Saarinen's \n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/womb.html\">womb chair</a> and the \n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/pantheon.html\">Pantheon</a> and the\noriginal <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/1974-911s.html\">Porsche 911</a> all seem\nto me slightly funny.  Godel's incompleteness theorem\nseems like a practical joke.<br/><br/>I think it's because humor is related to strength.\nTo have a sense of humor is to be strong:\nto keep one's sense of humor is to shrug off misfortunes,\nand to lose one's sense of humor is to be wounded by them.\nAnd so the mark-- or at least the prerogative-- of strength\nis not to take\noneself too seriously.\nThe confident will often, like\nswallows, seem to be making fun of the whole process slightly,\nas Hitchcock does in his films or Bruegel in his paintings-- or\nShakespeare, for that matter.<br/><br/>Good design may not have to be funny, but it's hard to\nimagine something that could be called humorless also being\ngood design.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Good design is hard.</b>  If you look at the people who've\ndone great work, one thing they all seem to have in common is that they\nworked very hard.  If you're not working hard,\nyou're probably wasting your time.<br/><br/>Hard problems call for great\nefforts.  In math, difficult proofs require ingenious solutions,\nand those tend to be interesting.  Ditto in engineering.<br/><br/>When you\nhave to climb a mountain you toss everything unnecessary\nout of your pack.  And so an architect who has to build\non a difficult site, or a small budget, will find that he\nis forced to produce an elegant design.  Fashions and\nflourishes get knocked aside by the difficult business\nof solving the problem at all.<br/><br/>Not every kind of hard is good.  There is good pain and bad pain.\nYou want the kind of pain you get from going running, not the\nkind you get from stepping on a nail.\nA difficult\nproblem could be good for a designer, but a fickle client or unreliable\nmaterials would not be.<br/><br/>In art, the highest place has traditionally been given to\npaintings of people.  There is something to this tradition,\nand not just because pictures of faces get to press\nbuttons in our brains that other pictures don't.  We are \nso good at looking at faces that we force anyone who\ndraws them to work hard to satisfy us.  If you\ndraw a tree and you change the angle of a branch\nfive degrees, no one will know.  When you change the angle\nof someone's eye five degrees, people notice.<br/><br/>When Bauhaus designers adopted Sullivan's \"form follows function,\"\nwhat they meant was, form <i>should</i> follow function.  And\nif function is hard enough, form is forced to follow it,\nbecause there is no effort to spare for error.  Wild animals\nare beautiful because they have hard lives.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Good design looks easy.</b>  Like great athletes,\ngreat designers make it look easy.  Mostly this is\nan illusion.  The easy, conversational tone of good\nwriting comes only on the eighth rewrite.<br/><br/>In science and engineering, some of the greatest\ndiscoveries seem so simple that you say to yourself,\nI could have thought of that.  The discoverer is\nentitled to reply, why didn't you?<br/><br/>Some Leonardo heads are just a few lines.  You look\nat them and you think, all you have to do is get eight\nor ten lines in the right place and you've made this beautiful\nportrait.  Well, yes, but you have to get them in\n<i>exactly</i> the right place.  The slightest error\nwill make the whole thing collapse.<br/><br/>Line drawings are in fact the most difficult visual\nmedium, because they demand near perfection.\nIn math terms, they are a closed-form solution; lesser  \nartists literally solve the same problems by successive\napproximation.  One of the reasons kids give up drawing\nat ten or so is that they decide to start\ndrawing like grownups, and one of the first things\nthey try is a line drawing of a face.  Smack!<br/><br/>In most fields the appearance of ease seems to come with\npractice.  Perhaps what practice does is train your\nunconscious mind to handle tasks that used to\nrequire conscious thought.  In some cases\nyou literally train your body.  An expert pianist can\nplay notes faster than the brain can send signals to\nhis hand.  \nLikewise an artist, after a while, can\nmake visual perception flow in through his eye and\nout through his hand as automatically as someone tapping his foot to\na beat.<br/><br/>When people talk about being in\n\"the zone,\" I think what they mean is that the\nspinal cord has the situation under control.\nYour spinal cord is less hesitant, and\nit frees conscious thought for the hard problems.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Good design uses symmetry.</b>\nI think symmetry may just\nbe one way to achieve simplicity, but it's important enough\nto be mentioned on its own.\nNature uses it a lot, which is a good sign.<br/><br/>There are two kinds of symmetry, repetition and recursion.\nRecursion means repetition in subelements, like the\npattern of veins in a leaf.<br/><br/>Symmetry is unfashionable in some fields now, in reaction to\nexcesses in the past.  Architects started consciously\nmaking buildings asymmetric in Victorian times and by the\n1920s asymmetry was an explicit premise of modernist architecture.\nEven these buildings only tended to be asymmetric\nabout major axes, though; there were hundreds of minor symmetries.<br/><br/>In writing you find symmetry at every level, from the phrases\nin a sentence to the plot of a novel.  You find the same\nin music and art.\nMosaics (and some Cezannes) get extra visual punch by making\nthe whole picture out of the same atoms.  Compositional \nsymmetry yields some of the most memorable paintings,  \nespecially when two halves react to one another, as in \nthe <i><a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/symptg.html\">Creation of Adam</a></i> or \n<i><a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/symptg.html\">American Gothic</a>.</i><br/><br/>In math and engineering, recursion, especially, is a big win.\nInductive proofs are wonderfully short.  In software,\na problem that can be solved by recursion is nearly always\nbest solved that way. The Eiffel Tower looks striking partly\nbecause it is a recursive solution, a tower on a tower.<br/><br/>The danger of symmetry, and repetition especially, is that\nit can be used as a substitute for thought.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Good design resembles nature.</b>  It's not so much that\nresembling nature is intrinsically good as that nature\nhas had a long time to work on the\nproblem.  It's a good sign when your answer resembles nature's.<br/><br/>It's not cheating to copy.\nFew would deny that a story should be like life.\nWorking from life is a valuable tool in painting too, though its\nrole has often been misunderstood.\nThe aim is not simply to make a record.\nThe point of painting from life is\nthat it gives your mind something to chew on:  when your\neyes are looking at something, your hand will do more\ninteresting work.<br/><br/>Imitating nature also works in engineering.  Boats have\nlong had spines and ribs like an animal's ribcage.\nIn some cases we may have to wait for better technology:\nearly aircraft designers were mistaken to\ndesign aircraft that looked like birds, because they didn't\nhave materials or power sources light enough (the Wrights' engine\nweighed 152 lbs. and\ngenerated only 12 hp.) or control systems sophisticated\nenough for machines that flew like birds, but I could\nimagine little unmanned reconnaissance planes flying\nlike birds in fifty years.<br/><br/>Now that we have enough computer power, we can imitate nature's   \nmethod as well as its results.  Genetic algorithms may let us\ncreate things too complex to design in the ordinary\nsense.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Good design is redesign.</b>  It's rare to get things right\nthe first time.  Experts expect to throw away some early work.\nThey plan for plans to change.<br/><br/>It takes confidence to throw work away.  You have to be able \nto think, <i>there's more where that came from.</i>   \nWhen people first start drawing, for example,\nthey're often reluctant to redo parts that aren't\nright; they feel they've been lucky to get that far,   \nand if they try to redo something, it will turn out worse.  Instead\nthey convince themselves that the drawing is not that bad,\nreally-- in fact, maybe they meant it to look that way.<br/><br/>Dangerous territory, that; if anything you should\ncultivate dissatisfaction.\nIn Leonardo's <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/leonardo.html\">drawings</a> there are often five\nor six attempts to get a line right.\nThe distinctive back of the Porsche\n911 only appeared in the redesign of an awkward \n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/porsche695.html\">prototype</a>.\nIn Wright's early plans for the \n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/guggen.html\">Guggenheim</a>,\nthe right half was a ziggurat; he inverted it to get the\npresent shape.<br/><br/>Mistakes are natural.  Instead of treating them\nas disasters, make them easy to acknowledge and easy to fix.\nLeonardo more or less invented the sketch, as a\nway to make drawing bear a greater weight of exploration.\nOpen-source software has fewer bugs because it admits the\npossibility of bugs.<br/><br/>It helps to have a medium that makes change easy.\nWhen oil paint replaced tempera in the fifteenth century,\nit helped\npainters to deal with difficult subjects like the human \nfigure because, unlike tempera, oil can be blended and overpainted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Good design can copy.</b>  Attitudes to copying\noften make a round trip.  A novice\nimitates without knowing it; next he tries\nconsciously to be original; finally, he decides it's\nmore important to be right than original.<br/><br/>Unknowing imitation is almost a recipe for bad design.\nIf you don't know where your ideas are coming from,\nyou're probably imitating an imitator.\nRaphael so pervaded mid-nineteenth century taste that almost \nanyone who tried to draw was imitating him, often at several\nremoves.\nIt was this, more than Raphael's own work, that bothered\nthe Pre-Raphaelites.<br/><br/>The ambitious are not content to imitate. The\nsecond phase in the growth of taste is a conscious\nattempt at originality.<br/><br/>I think the\ngreatest masters go on to achieve a kind of selflessness.\nThey just want to get the right answer, and if part of the\nright answer has already been discovered by someone else,\nthat's no reason not to use it.\nThey're confident enough to take from anyone without\nfeeling that their own vision will be lost in the process.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Good design is often strange.</b>  Some of the very best work\nhas an uncanny quality: <a href=\"http://mathworld.wolfram.com/EulerFormula.html\">Euler's \nFormula</a>, \nBruegel's\n<i><a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/hunters.html\">Hunters in the Snow</a>,</i> the \n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/sr71.html\">SR-71</a>, <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/rootsoflisp.html\">Lisp</a>.  They're not just\nbeautiful, but strangely beautiful.<br/><br/>I'm not sure why.  It may just be my own stupidity.  A\ncan-opener must seem miraculous to a dog.  Maybe if I were smart\nenough it would seem the most natural thing in the world that\ne<sup>i*pi</sup> = -1.  It is after all necessarily true.<br/><br/>Most of the qualities I've mentioned are things that can be\ncultivated, but I don't think it works to cultivate strangeness.\nThe best you can do is not squash it if it starts to appear.\nEinstein didn't try to make relativity strange.\nHe tried to make it true, and the truth turned out to be strange.<br/><br/>At an art school where I once studied, the students wanted\nmost of all to develop a personal style.\nBut if you just try to make good things, you'll  \ninevitably do it in a distinctive way, just as each person\nwalks in a distinctive way.  Michelangelo was not trying\nto paint like Michelangelo.  He was just trying to paint\nwell; he couldn't help painting like Michelangelo.<br/><br/>The only style worth having is the one you can't help.\nAnd this is especially true for strangeness.  There is no\nshortcut to it.  The Northwest Passage that the Mannerists,\nthe Romantics, and two generations of American high school\nstudents have searched for does not seem to exist.  The\nonly way to get there is to go through good and come out\nthe other side.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Good design happens in chunks.</b>  The inhabitants\nof fifteenth century Florence included Brunelleschi, Ghiberti,\nDonatello, Masaccio, Filippo Lippi, \nFra Angelico, Verrocchio, Botticelli, Leonardo, and Michelangelo.\nMilan at the time was as big as Florence.\nHow many fifteenth century Milanese artists can you name?<br/><br/>Something was happening in Florence in the fifteenth century.\nAnd it can't have been heredity, because it isn't happening now.\nYou have to assume that whatever\ninborn ability Leonardo and Michelangelo had, there were\npeople born in Milan with just as much.  What happened to\nthe Milanese Leonardo?<br/><br/>There are roughly a thousand times\nas many people alive in the US right now as lived in\nFlorence during the fifteenth century.  A thousand Leonardos\nand a thousand Michelangelos walk among us.\nIf DNA ruled, we should be greeted daily by artistic\nmarvels.  We aren't, and the reason is that to make Leonardo\nyou need more than his innate ability.  You also need Florence \nin 1450.<br/><br/>Nothing is more powerful\nthan a community of talented people working on related\nproblems.  Genes count for little by comparison: being a genetic\nLeonardo was not enough to compensate for having been born   \nnear Milan instead of Florence.\nToday we move around more, but great work still comes\ndisproportionately from a few hotspots:\nthe Bauhaus, the Manhattan Project, the <i>New Yorker,</i>\nLockheed's Skunk Works, Xerox Parc.<br/><br/>At any given time there are a\nfew hot topics and a few groups doing great work on them,\nand it's nearly impossible to do\ngood work yourself if you're too far removed from one\nof these centers.  You can push or pull these trends\nto some extent, but you can't break away from them.\n(Maybe <i>you</i> can, but the Milanese Leonardo couldn't.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Good design is often daring.</b>  At every period   \nof history, people have believed things that were just   \nridiculous, and believed them so strongly that you risked  \nostracism or even violence by saying otherwise.<br/><br/>If our own time were any different, that would be remarkable.\nAs far as I can tell it <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/say.html\">isn't</a>.<br/><br/>This problem afflicts not just every\nera, but in some degree every field.\nMuch Renaissance art was in its time considered shockingly secular:\naccording to Vasari, Botticelli repented and gave up painting, and\nFra Bartolommeo and Lorenzo di Credi actually burned some of their\nwork.\nEinstein's theory of relativity offended many contemporary physicists,\nand was not fully accepted for decades-- in France, not until the\n1950s.<br/><br/>Today's experimental error is tomorrow's new theory.  If\nyou want to discover great new things, then instead of turning\na blind eye to the places where conventional wisdom and\ntruth don't quite meet, you should pay particular attention \nto them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As a practical matter, I think it's easier to see ugliness\nthan to imagine beauty.  Most of the people who've made beautiful\nthings seem to have done it by fixing something that they    \nthought ugly.  Great work usually seems to happen because someone sees\nsomething and thinks, <i>I could do better than that.</i>  Giotto\nsaw traditional Byzantine madonnas painted according to a\nformula that had satisfied everyone for centuries, and to him\nthey looked wooden and unnatural.\nCopernicus was so troubled by a hack that all his contemporaries\ncould tolerate that he felt there must be a better solution.<br/><br/>Intolerance for ugliness is not in itself enough.  You have to\nunderstand a field well before you develop a good nose for\nwhat needs fixing.  You have to do your homework.  But as\nyou become expert in a field, you'll start to hear little\nvoices saying, <i>What a hack!  There must be a better way.</i>\nDon't ignore those voices.  Cultivate them.  The recipe for\ngreat work is: very exacting taste, plus the ability\nto gratify it.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/><a href=\"https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/sullivan.html?t=1688221954&amp;\">Sullivan</a>\n actually said \"form ever follows function,\" but   \nI think the usual misquotation is closer to what modernist\narchitects meant.<br/><br/>\nStephen G.
