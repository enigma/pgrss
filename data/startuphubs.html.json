{"href":"startuphubs.html","title":"Why to Move to a Startup Hub","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">October 2007<br/><br/>After the last \n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/webstartups.html\">talk</a> I gave, one of the organizers \ngot up on the\nstage to deliver an impromptu rebuttal.  That never happened before.\nI only heard the first few sentences, but that was enough to tell\nwhat I said that upset him: that startups would do better if they\nmoved to Silicon Valley.<br/><br/>This conference was in London, and most of the audience seemed to\nbe from the UK.  So saying startups should move to Silicon Valley\nseemed like a nationalistic remark: an obnoxious American telling\nthem that if they wanted to do things right they should all just\nmove to America.<br/><br/>Actually I'm less American than I seem.  I didn't say so, but I'm\nBritish by birth.  And just as Jews are ex officio allowed to tell\nJewish jokes, I don't feel like I have to bother being diplomatic\nwith a British audience.<br/><br/>The idea that startups would do better to move to Silicon Valley\nis not even a nationalistic one.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/startuphubs.html#f1n\"><font color=\"#999999\">1</font></a>]</font>\nIt's the same thing I say to\nstartups in the US.  Y Combinator alternates between coasts every\n6 months. Every other funding cycle is in Boston.  And even though\nBoston is the second biggest startup hub in the US (and the world),\nwe tell the startups from those cycles that their best bet is to\nmove to Silicon Valley.  If that's true of Boston, it's even more\ntrue of every other city.<br/><br/>This is about cities, not countries.<br/><br/>And I think I can prove I'm right.  You can easily reduce the\nopposing argument ad what most people would agree was absurdum.\nFew would be willing to claim that it doesn't matter at all where\na startup isâ€”that a startup operating out of a small agricultural\ntown wouldn't benefit from moving to a startup hub.  Most people\ncould see how it might be helpful to be in a place where there was\ninfrastructure for startups, accumulated knowledge about how to\nmake them work, and other people trying to do it.  And yet whatever\nargument you use to prove that startups don't need to move from\nLondon to Silicon Valley could equally well be used to prove startups\ndon't need to move from smaller towns to London.<br/><br/>The difference between cities is a matter of degree.  And if, as\nnearly everyone who knows agrees, startups are better off in Silicon\nValley than Boston, then they're better off in Silicon Valley than\neverywhere else too.<br/><br/>I realize I might seem to have a vested interest in this conclusion,\nbecause startups that move to the US might do it through Y Combinator.\nBut the American startups we've funded will attest that I say the\nsame thing to them.<br/><br/>I'm not claiming of course that every startup has to go to Silicon\nValley to succeed.  Just that all other things being equal, the\nmore of a startup hub a place is, the better startups will do there.\nBut other considerations can outweigh the advantages of moving.\nI'm not saying founders with families should uproot them to move\nhalfway around the world; that might be too much of a distraction.<br/><br/>Immigration difficulties might be another reason to stay put.\nDealing with immigration problems is like raising money: for some\nreason it seems to consume all your attention.  A startup can't\nafford much of that.  One Canadian startup we funded spent about 6\nmonths working on moving to the US.  Eventually they just gave up,\nbecause they couldn't afford to take so much time away from working\non their software.<br/><br/>(If another country wanted to establish a rival to Silicon Valley,\nthe single best thing they could do might be to create a special\nvisa for startup founders.  US immigration policy is one of Silicon \nValley's biggest weaknesses.)<br/><br/>If your startup is connected to a specific industry, you may be\nbetter off in one of its centers.  A startup doing something related\nto entertainment might want to be in New York or LA.<br/><br/>And finally, if a good investor has committed to fund\nyou if you stay where you are, you should probably stay.  Finding\ninvestors is hard.  You generally shouldn't pass up a definite\nfunding offer to move.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/startuphubs.html#f2n\"><font color=\"#999999\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>In fact, the quality of the investors may be the main advantage of\nstartup hubs.  Silicon Valley investors are noticeably more aggressive\nthan Boston ones.  Over and over, I've seen startups we've funded\nsnatched by west coast investors out from under the noses of Boston\ninvestors who saw them first but acted too slowly.  At this year's\nBoston Demo Day, I told the audience that this happened every year,\nso if they saw a startup they liked, they should make them an offer.\nAnd yet within a month it had happened again: an aggressive west\ncoast VC who had met the founder of a YC-funded startup a week\nbefore beat out a Boston VC who had known him for years.  By the\ntime the Boston VC grasped what was happening, the deal was already\ngone.<br/><br/>Boston investors will admit they're more conservative.  Some want\nto believe this comes from the city's prudent Yankee character.\nBut Occam's razor suggests the truth is less flattering.  Boston\ninvestors are probably more conservative than Silicon Valley investors\nfor the same reason Chicago investors are more conservative than\nBoston ones.  They don't understand startups as well.<br/><br/>West coast investors aren't bolder because they're irresponsible\ncowboys, or because the good weather makes them optimistic.  They're\nbolder because they know what they're doing.  They're the skiers\nwho ski on the diamond slopes.  Boldness is the essence of venture\ninvesting.  The way you get big returns is not by trying to avoid\nlosses, but by trying to ensure you get some of the big hits. And\nthe big hits often look risky at first.<br/><br/>Like Facebook.  Facebook was started in Boston.  Boston VCs had the\nfirst shot at them.  But they said no, so Facebook moved to Silicon\nValley and raised money there.  The partner who turned them down\nnow says that \"may turn out to have been a mistake.\"<br/><br/>Empirically, boldness wins.  If the aggressive ways of west coast\ninvestors are going to come back to bite them, it has been a long\ntime coming.  Silicon Valley has been pulling ahead of Boston since\nthe 1970s.  If there was going to be a comeuppance for the west\ncoast investors, the bursting of the Bubble would have been it.\nBut since then the west coast has just pulled further ahead.<br/><br/>West coast investors are confident enough of their judgement to act\nboldly; east coast investors, not so much; but anyone who thinks\neast coast investors act that way out of prudence should see the\nfrantic reactions of an east coast VC in the process of losing a\ndeal to a west coast one.<br/><br/>In addition to the concentration that comes from specialization,\nstartup hubs are also markets.  And markets are usually centralized.\nEven now, when traders could be anywhere, they cluster in a few\ncities.  It's hard to say exactly what it is about face to face\ncontact that makes deals happen, but whatever it is, it hasn't yet\nbeen duplicated by technology.<br/><br/>Walk down University Ave at the right time, and you might overhear\nfive different people talking on the phone about deals.  In fact,\nthis is part of the reason Y Combinator is in Boston half the time:\nit's hard to stand that year round.  But though it can sometimes\nbe annoying to be surrounded by people who only think about one\nthing, it's the place to be if that one thing is what you're trying\nto do.<br/><br/>I was talking recently to someone who works on search at Google.\nHe knew a lot of people at Yahoo, so he was in a good position to\ncompare the two companies.  I asked him why Google was better at\nsearch.  He said it wasn't anything specific Google did, but simply\nthat they understood search so much better.<br/><br/>And that's why startups thrive in startup hubs like Silicon Valley.\nStartups are a very specialized business, as specialized as diamond\ncutting.  And in startup hubs they understand it.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nThe nationalistic idea is the converse: that startups should\nstay in a certain city because of the country it's in.
