I was saying recently to\na reporter that if I could only tell startups 10 things, this would\nbe one of them.  Then I thought: what would the other 9 be?<br/><br/>When I made the list there turned out to be 13:\n<p style=\"margin-top:32px\">\n<b>1. Pick good cofounders.</b><br/><br/>Cofounders are for a startup what location is for real estate.  You\ncan change anything about a house except where it is.  In a startup\nyou can change your idea easily, but changing your cofounders is\nhard. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f1n\"><font color=\"#999999\">1</font></a>]</font>\nAnd the success of a startup is almost always a function\nof its founders.<br/><br/><b>2. Launch fast.</b><br/><br/>The reason to launch fast is not so much that it's critical to get\nyour product to market early, but that you haven't really started\nworking on it till you've launched.  Launching teaches you what you\nshould have been building.  Till you know that you're wasting your\ntime.  So the main value of whatever you launch with is as a pretext\nfor engaging users.<br/><br/><b>3. Let your idea evolve.</b><br/><br/>This is the second half of launching fast. Launch fast and iterate.\nIt's a big mistake to treat a startup as if it were merely a matter\nof implementing some brilliant initial idea. As in an essay, most\nof the ideas appear in the implementing.<br/><br/><b>4. Understand your users.</b><br/><br/>You can envision the wealth created by a startup as a rectangle,\nwhere one side is the number of users and the other is how much you\nimprove their lives.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f2n\"><font color=\"#999999\">2</font></a>]</font>\nThe second dimension is the one you have\nmost control over.  And indeed, the growth in the first will be\ndriven by how well you do in the second.  As in science, the hard\npart is not answering questions but asking them: the hard part is\nseeing something new that users lack. The better you understand\nthem the better the odds of doing that. That's why so many successful\nstartups make something the founders needed.<br/><br/><b>5. Better to make a few users love you than a lot ambivalent.</b><br/><br/>Ideally you want to make large numbers of users love you, but you\ncan't expect to hit that right away.  Initially you have to choose\nbetween satisfying all the needs of a subset of potential users,\nor satisfying a subset of the needs of all potential users.  Take\nthe first. It's easier to expand userwise than satisfactionwise.\nAnd perhaps more importantly, it's harder to lie to yourself.  If\nyou think you're 85% of the way to a great product, how do you know\nit's not 70%?  Or 10%?  Whereas it's easy to know how many users\nyou have.<br/><br/><b>6. Offer surprisingly good customer service.</b><br/><br/>Customers are used to being maltreated.  Most of the companies they\ndeal with are quasi-monopolies that get away with atrocious customer\nservice. Your own ideas about what's possible have been unconsciously\nlowered by such experiences.  Try making your customer service not\nmerely good, but \n<a href=\"http://www.diaryofawebsite.com/blog/2008/07/wufoo-and-the-art-of-customer-service/\">surprisingly good</a>.  Go out of your way to make\npeople happy.  They'll be overwhelmed; you'll see.  In the earliest\nstages of a startup, it pays to offer customer service on a level\nthat wouldn't scale, because it's a way of learning about your\nusers.<br/><br/><b>7. You make what you measure.</b><br/><br/>I learned this one from Joe Kraus. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f3n\"><font color=\"#999999\">3</font></a>]</font>\nMerely measuring something\nhas an uncanny tendency to improve it.  If you want to make your\nuser numbers go up, put a big piece of paper on your wall and every\nday plot the number of users.  You'll be delighted when it goes up\nand disappointed when it goes down.  Pretty soon you'll start\nnoticing what makes the number go up, and you'll start to do more\nof that.  Corollary: be careful what you measure.<br/><br/><b>8. Spend little.</b><br/><br/>I can't emphasize enough how important it is for a startup to be cheap.\nMost startups fail before they make something people want, and the\nmost common form of failure is running out of money.  So being cheap\nis (almost) interchangeable with iterating rapidly.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f4n\"><font color=\"#999999\">4</font></a>]</font>\nBut it's\nmore than that.  A culture of cheapness keeps companies young in\nsomething like the way exercise keeps people young.<br/><br/><b>9. Get ramen profitable.</b><br/><br/>\"Ramen profitable\" means a startup makes just enough to pay the\nfounders' living expenses.  It's not rapid prototyping for business\nmodels (though it can be), but more a way of hacking the investment\nprocess.  Once you cross over into ramen profitable, it completely\nchanges your relationship with investors.  It's also great for\nmorale.<br/><br/><b>10. Avoid distractions.</b><br/><br/>Nothing kills startups like distractions.  The worst type are those\nthat pay money: day jobs, consulting, profitable side-projects.\nThe startup may have more long-term potential, but you'll always\ninterrupt working on it to answer calls from people paying you now.\nParadoxically, <a href=\"fundraising.html\">fundraising</a> is this type of distraction, so try to\nminimize that too.<br/><br/><b>11. Don't get demoralized.</b><br/><br/>Though the immediate cause of death in a startup tends to be running\nout of money, the underlying cause is usually lack of focus.  Either\nthe company is run by stupid people (which can't be fixed with\nadvice) or the people are smart but got demoralized.  Starting a\nstartup is a huge moral weight.  Understand this and make a conscious\neffort not to be ground down by it, just as you'd be careful to\nbend at the knees when picking up a heavy box.<br/><br/><b>12. Don't give up.</b><br/><br/>Even if you get demoralized, <a href=\"die.html\">don't give up</a>.  You can get surprisingly\nfar by just not giving up.  This isn't true in all fields.  There\nare a lot of people who couldn't become good mathematicians no\nmatter how long they persisted.  But startups aren't like that.\nSheer effort is usually enough, so long as you keep morphing your\nidea.<br/><br/><b>13. Deals fall through.</b><br/><br/>One of the most useful skills we learned from Viaweb was not getting\nour hopes up.  We probably had 20 deals of various types fall\nthrough.  After the first 10 or so we learned to treat deals as\nbackground processes that we should ignore till they terminated.\nIt's very dangerous to morale to start to depend on deals closing,\nnot just because they so often don't, but because it makes them\nless likely to.\n<p style=\"margin-top:32px\">\nHaving gotten it down to 13 sentences, I asked myself which I'd\nchoose if I could only keep one.<br/><br/>Understand your users.  That's the key.  The essential task in a\nstartup is to create wealth; the dimension of wealth you have most\ncontrol over is how much you improve users' lives; and the hardest\npart of that is knowing what to make for them.  Once you know what\nto make, it's mere effort to make it, and most decent hackers are\ncapable of that.<br/><br/>Understanding your users is part of half the principles in this\nlist.  That's the reason to launch early, to understand your users.\nEvolving your idea is the embodiment of understanding your users.\nUnderstanding your users well will tend to push you toward making\nsomething that makes a few people deeply happy.  The most important\nreason for having surprisingly good customer service is that it\nhelps you understand your users.  And understanding your users will\neven ensure your morale, because when everything else is collapsing\naround you, having just ten users who love you will keep you going.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nStrictly speaking it's impossible without a time machine.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nIn practice it's more like a ragged comb.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nJoe thinks one of the founders of Hewlett Packard said it first,\nbut he doesn't remember which.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f4n\"><font color=\"#000000\">4</font></a>]\nThey'd be interchangeable if markets stood still.
