{"href":"genius.html","title":"The Bus Ticket Theory of Genius","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">November 2019<br/><br/>Everyone knows that to do great work you need both natural ability\nand determination. But there's a third ingredient that's not as\nwell understood: an obsessive interest in a particular topic.<br/><br/>To explain this point I need to burn my reputation with some group\nof people, and I'm going to choose bus ticket collectors.  There\nare people who collect old bus tickets. Like many collectors, they\nhave an obsessive interest in the minutiae of what they collect.\nThey can keep track of distinctions between different types of bus\ntickets that would be hard for the rest of us to remember.  Because\nwe don't care enough. What's the point of spending so much time\nthinking about old bus tickets?<br/><br/>Which leads us to the second feature of this kind of obsession:\nthere is no point. A bus ticket collector's love is disinterested.\nThey're not doing it to impress us or to make themselves rich, but\nfor its own sake.<br/><br/>When you look at the lives of people who've done great work, you\nsee a consistent pattern. They often begin with a bus ticket\ncollector's obsessive interest in something that would have seemed\npointless to most of their contemporaries. One of the most striking\nfeatures of Darwin's book about his voyage on the Beagle is the\nsheer depth of his interest in natural history. His curiosity seems\ninfinite. Ditto for Ramanujan, sitting by the hour working out on\nhis slate what happens to series.<br/><br/>It's a mistake to think they were \"laying the groundwork\" for the\ndiscoveries they made later. There's too much intention in that\nmetaphor. Like bus ticket collectors, they were doing it\nbecause they liked it.<br/><br/>But there is a difference between Ramanujan and a bus ticket\ncollector. Series matter, and bus tickets don't.<br/><br/>If I had to put the recipe for genius into one sentence, that might\nbe it: to have a disinterested obsession with something that matters.<br/><br/>Aren't I forgetting about the other two ingredients? Less than you\nmight think. An obsessive interest in a topic is both a proxy for\nability and a substitute for determination.  Unless you have\nsufficient mathematical aptitude, you won't find series interesting.\nAnd when you're obsessively interested in something, you don't need\nas much determination: you don't need to push yourself as hard when\ncuriosity is pulling you.<br/><br/>An obsessive interest will even bring you luck, to the extent\nanything can. Chance, as Pasteur said, favors the prepared mind,\nand if there's one thing an obsessed mind is, it's prepared.<br/><br/>The disinterestedness of this kind of obsession is its most important\nfeature. Not just because it's a filter for earnestness, but because\nit helps you discover new ideas.<br/><br/>The paths that lead to new ideas tend to look unpromising. If they\nlooked promising, other people would already have explored them.\nHow do the people who do great work discover these paths that others\noverlook?  The popular story is that they simply have better vision:\nbecause they're so talented, they see paths that others miss.  But\nif you look at the way great discoveries are made, that's not what\nhappens. Darwin didn't pay closer attention to individual species\nthan other people because he saw that this would lead to great\ndiscoveries, and they didn't. He was just really, really interested\nin such things.<br/><br/>Darwin couldn't turn it off. Neither could Ramanujan.  They didn't\ndiscover the hidden paths that they did because they seemed promising,\nbut because they couldn't help it. That's what allowed them to\nfollow paths that someone who was merely ambitious would have\nignored.<br/><br/>What rational person would decide that the way to write great novels\nwas to begin by spending several years creating an imaginary elvish\nlanguage, like Tolkien, or visiting every household in southwestern\nBritain, like Trollope? No one, including Tolkien and Trollope.<br/><br/>The bus ticket theory is similar to Carlyle's famous definition of\ngenius as an infinite capacity for taking pains. But there are two\ndifferences. The bus ticket theory makes it clear that the source\nof this infinite capacity for taking pains is not infinite diligence,\nas Carlyle seems to have meant, but the sort of infinite interest\nthat collectors have. It also adds an important qualification: an\ninfinite capacity for taking pains about something that matters.<br/><br/>So what  matters? You can never be sure. It's precisely because no\none can tell in advance which paths are promising that you can\ndiscover new ideas by working on what you're interested in.<br/><br/>But there are some heuristics you can use to guess whether an\nobsession might be one that matters. For example, it's more promising\nif you're creating something, rather than just consuming something\nsomeone else creates. It's more promising if something you're\ninterested in is difficult, especially if it's <a href=\"work.html\"><u>more difficult for\nother people</u></a> than it is for you. And the obsessions of talented\npeople are more likely to be promising. When talented people become\ninterested in random things, they're not truly random.<br/><br/>But you can never be sure. In fact, here's an interesting idea\nthat's also rather alarming if it's true: it may be that to do great\nwork, you also have to waste a lot of time.<br/><br/>In many different areas, reward is proportionate to risk. If that\nrule holds here, then the way to find paths that lead to truly great\nwork is to be willing to expend a lot of effort on things that turn\nout to be every bit as unpromising as they seem.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if this is true. On one hand, it seems surprisingly\ndifficult to waste your time so long as you're working hard on\nsomething interesting. So much of what you do ends up being useful.\nBut on the other hand, the rule about the relationship between risk\nand reward is so powerful that it seems to hold wherever risk occurs.\n<a href=\"disc.html\"><u>Newton's</u></a> case, at least, suggests that the risk/reward rule holds\nhere. He's famous for one particular obsession of his that turned\nout to be unprecedentedly fruitful: using math to describe the\nworld. But he had two other obsessions, alchemy and theology, that\nseem to have been complete wastes of time. He ended up net ahead.\nHis bet on what we now call physics paid off so well that it more\nthan compensated for the other two. But were the other two necessary,\nin the sense that he had to take big risks to make such big\ndiscoveries? I don't know.<br/><br/>Here's an even more alarming idea: might one make all bad bets?  It\nprobably happens quite often. But we don't know how often, because\nthese people don't become famous.<br/><br/>It's not merely that the returns from following a path are hard to\npredict. They change dramatically over time. 1830 was a really good\ntime to be obsessively interested in natural history. If Darwin had\nbeen born in 1709 instead of 1809, we might never have heard of\nhim.<br/><br/>What can one do in the face of such uncertainty?  One solution is\nto hedge your bets, which in this case means to follow the obviously\npromising paths instead of your own private obsessions. But as with\nany hedge, you're decreasing reward when you decrease risk.  If you\nforgo working on what you like in order to follow some more\nconventionally ambitious path, you might miss something wonderful\nthat you'd otherwise have discovered. That too must happen all the\ntime, perhaps even more often than the genius whose bets all fail.<br/><br/>The other solution is to let yourself be interested in lots of\ndifferent things. You don't decrease your upside if you switch\nbetween equally genuine interests based on which seems to be working\nso far. But there is a danger here too: if you work on too many\ndifferent projects, you might not get deeply enough into any of\nthem.<br/><br/>One interesting thing about the bus ticket theory is that it may\nhelp explain why different types of people excel at different kinds\nof work. Interest is much more unevenly distributed than ability.\nIf natural ability is all you need to do great work, and natural\nability is evenly distributed, you have to invent elaborate theories\nto explain the skewed distributions we see among those who actually\ndo great work in various fields. But it may be that much of the\nskew has a simpler explanation: different people are interested in\ndifferent things.<br/><br/>The bus ticket theory also explains why people are less likely to\ndo great work after they have children. Here interest has to compete\nnot just with external obstacles, but with another interest, and\none that for most people is extremely powerful. It's harder to find\ntime for work after you have kids, but that's the easy part. The\nreal change is that you don't <xa href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/186050/children-key-factor-women-desire-work-outside-home.aspx\">want to.<br/><br/>But the most exciting implication of the bus ticket theory is that\nit suggests ways to encourage great work. If the recipe for genius\nis simply natural ability plus hard work, all we can do is hope we\nhave a lot of ability, and work as hard as we can. But if interest\nis a critical ingredient in genius, we may be able, by cultivating\ninterest, to cultivate genius.<br/><br/>For example, for the very ambitious, the bus ticket theory suggests\nthat the way to do great work is to relax a little. Instead of\ngritting your teeth and diligently pursuing what all your peers\nagree is the most promising line of research, maybe you should try\ndoing something just for fun. And if you're stuck, that may be the\nvector along which to break out.<br/><br/>I've always liked <a href=\"hamming.html\"><u>Hamming's</u></a> famous double-barrelled question: what\nare the most important problems in your field, and why aren't you\nworking on one of them? It's a great way to shake yourself up. But\nit may be overfitting a bit. It might be at least as useful to ask\nyourself: if you could take a year off to work on something that\nprobably wouldn't be important but would be really interesting,\nwhat would it be?<br/><br/>The bus ticket theory also suggests a way to avoid slowing down as\nyou get older. Perhaps the reason people have fewer new ideas as\nthey get older is not simply that they're losing their edge. It may\nalso be because once you become established, you can no longer mess\nabout with irresponsible side projects the way you could when you\nwere young and no one cared what you did.<br/><br/>The solution to that is obvious: remain irresponsible. It will be\nhard, though, because the apparently random projects you take up\nto stave off decline will read to outsiders as evidence of it.  And\nyou yourself won't know for sure that they're wrong. But it will\nat least be more fun to work on what you want.<br/><br/>It may even be that we can cultivate a habit of intellectual bus\nticket collecting in kids. The usual plan in education is to start\nwith a broad, shallow focus, then gradually become more specialized.\nBut I've done the opposite with my kids. I know I can count on their\nschool to handle the broad, shallow part, so I take them deep.<br/><br/>When they get interested in something, however random, I encourage\nthem to go preposterously, bus ticket collectorly, deep.  I don't\ndo this because of the bus ticket theory. I do it because I want\nthem to feel the joy of learning, and they're never going to feel\nthat about something I'm making them learn. It has to be something\nthey're interested in. I'm just following the path of least resistance;\ndepth is a byproduct. But if in trying to show them the joy of\nlearning I also end up training them to go deep, so much the better.<br/><br/>Will it have any effect? I have no idea. But that uncertainty may\nbe the most interesting point of all. There is so much more to learn\nabout how to do great work. As old as human civilization feels,\nit's really still very young if we haven't nailed something so\nbasic. It's exciting to think there are still discoveries to make\nabout discovery. If that's the sort of thing you're interested in.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[1] There are other types of collecting that illustrate this point\nbetter than bus tickets, but they're also more popular. It seemed\njust as well to use an inferior example rather than offend more\npeople by telling them their hobby doesn't matter.<br/><br/>[2] I worried a little about using the word \"disinterested,\" since\nsome people mistakenly believe it means not interested. But anyone\nwho expects to be a genius will have to know the meaning of such a\nbasic word, so I figure they may as well start now.<br/><br/>[3] Think how often genius must have been nipped in the bud by\npeople being told, or telling themselves, to stop messing about and\nbe responsible. Ramanujan's mother was a huge enabler. Imagine if\nshe hadn't been. Imagine if his parents had made him go out and get\na job instead of sitting around at home doing math.<br/><br/>On the other hand, anyone quoting the preceding paragraph to justify\nnot getting a job is probably mistaken.<br/><br/>[4] 1709 Darwin is to time what the <a href=\"cities.html\"><u>Milanese Leonardo</u></a> is to space.<br/><br/>[5] \"An infinite capacity for taking pains\" is a paraphrase of what\nCarlyle wrote. What he wrote, in his <i>History of Frederick the Great</i>,\nwas \"... it is the fruit of 'genius' (which means transcendent\ncapacity of taking trouble, first of all)....\" Since the paraphrase\nseems the name of the idea at this point, I kept it.<br/><br/>Carlyle's <i>History</i> was published in 1858. In 1785 Hérault de Séchelles\nquoted Buffon as saying \"Le génie n'est qu'une plus grande aptitude\nà la patience.\" (Genius is only a greater aptitude for patience.)<br/><br/>[6] Trollope was establishing the system of postal routes. He himself\nsensed the obsessiveness with which he pursued this goal.\n<blockquote>\n   It is amusing to watch how a passion will grow upon a man. During\n   those two years it was the ambition of my life to cover the\n   country with rural letter-carriers.\n</blockquote>\nEven Newton occasionally sensed the degree of his obsessiveness.\nAfter computing pi to 15 digits, he wrote in a letter to a friend:\n<blockquote>\n   I am ashamed to tell you to how many figures I carried these\n   computations, having no other business at the time.\n</blockquote>\nIncidentally, Ramanujan was also a compulsive calculator. As Kanigel\nwrites in his excellent biography:\n<blockquote>\n  One Ramanujan scholar, B. M. Wilson, later told how Ramanujan's\n  research into number theory was often \"preceded by a table of\n  numerical results, carried usually to a length from which most\n  of us would shrink.\"\n</blockquote>\n[7] Working to understand the natural world counts as creating\nrather than consuming.<br/><br/>Newton tripped over this distinction when he chose\nto work on theology. His beliefs did not allow him to see it, but\nchasing down paradoxes in nature is fruitful in a way that chasing\ndown paradoxes in sacred texts is not.<br/><br/>[8] How much of people's propensity to become interested in a topic\nis inborn?  My experience so far suggests the answer is: most of\nit. Different kids get interested in different things, and it's\nhard to make a child interested in something they wouldn't otherwise\nbe. Not in a way that sticks.  The most you can do on behalf of a\ntopic is to make sure it gets a fair showing  to make it clear to\nthem, for example, that there's more to math than the dull drills\nthey do in school. After that it's up to the child.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Marc Andreessen, Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison, Kevin\nLacker, Jessica Livingston, Jackie McDonough, Robert Morris, Lisa\nRandall, Zak Stone, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1196537802621669376\"><u>my 7 year old</u></a> for reading drafts of this.<br/><br/></xa></font>","date":"2019-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
