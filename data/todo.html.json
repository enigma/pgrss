{"href":"todo.html","title":"The Top of My Todo List","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">April 2012<br/><br/>A palliative care nurse called Bronnie Ware made a list of the\nbiggest <a href=\"http://bronnieware.com/regrets-of-the-dying/\">regrets\nof the dying</a>.  Her list seems plausible.  I could see\nmyself — <i>can</i> see myself — making at least 4 of these\n5 mistakes.<br/><br/>If you had to compress them into a single piece of advice, it might\nbe: don't be a cog.  The 5 regrets paint a portrait of post-industrial\nman, who shrinks himself into a shape that fits his circumstances,\nthen turns dutifully till he stops.<br/><br/>The alarming thing is, the mistakes that produce these regrets are\nall errors of omission.  You forget your dreams, ignore your family,\nsuppress your feelings, neglect your friends, and forget to be\nhappy.  Errors of omission are a particularly dangerous type of\nmistake, because you make them by default.<br/><br/>I would like to avoid making these mistakes.  But how do you avoid\nmistakes you make by default?  Ideally you transform your life so\nit has other defaults.  But it may not be possible to do that\ncompletely. As long as these mistakes happen by default, you probably\nhave to be reminded not to make them.  So I inverted the 5 regrets,\nyielding a list of 5 commands\n<blockquote>\n   Don't ignore your dreams; don't work too much; say what you\n   think; cultivate friendships; be happy.\n</blockquote>\nwhich I then put at the top of the file I use as a todo list.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2012-04-01T00:00:00Z"}
