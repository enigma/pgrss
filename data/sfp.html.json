{"href":"sfp.html","title":"What I Did this Summer","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">October 2005<br/><br/>The first Summer Founders Program has just finished.  We were\nsurprised how well it went.  Overall only about 10% of startups   \nsucceed, but if I had to guess now, I'd predict three or four of  \nthe eight startups we funded will make it.<br/><br/>Of the startups that needed further funding, I believe all have\neither closed a round or are likely to soon.  Two have already\nturned down (lowball) acquisition offers.<br/><br/>We would have been happy if just one of the eight seemed promising\nby the end of the summer.  What's going on?  Did some kind of anomaly\nmake this summer's applicants especially good?  We worry about that,\nbut we can't think of one.  We'll find out this winter.<br/><br/>The whole summer was full of surprises.  The best was that the <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/hiring.html\">hypothesis</a> we were testing seems to be\ncorrect.  Young hackers can start viable companies.  This is good\nnews for two reasons: (a) it's an encouraging thought, and (b) it \nmeans that Y Combinator, which is predicated on the idea, is not\nhosed.<br/><br/><b>Age</b><br/><br/>More precisely, the hypothesis was that success in a startup depends\nmainly on how smart and energetic you are, and much less on how old\nyou are or how much business experience you have.  The results so\nfar bear this out.  The 2005 summer founders ranged in age from 18  \nto 28 (average 23), and there is no correlation between their ages\nand how well they're doing.<br/><br/>This should not really be surprising. Bill Gates and Michael Dell \nwere both 19 when they started the companies that made them famous.\nYoung founders are not a new phenomenon: the trend began as soon\nas computers got cheap enough for college kids to afford them.<br/><br/>Another of our hypotheses was that you can start a startup on less\nmoney than most people think.  Other investors were surprised to\nhear the most we gave any group was $20,000.  But we knew it was\npossible to start on that little because we started Viaweb on\n$10,000.<br/><br/>And so it proved this summer.  Three months' funding is enough to\nget into second gear.  We had a demo day for potential investors\nten weeks in, and seven of the eight groups had a prototype ready\nby that time.  One, <a href=\"http://reddit.com\">Reddit</a>, had\nalready launched, and were able to give a demo of their live site.<br/><br/>A researcher who studied the SFP startups said the one thing they \nhad in common was that they all worked ridiculously hard.  People\nthis age are commonly seen as lazy.  I think in some cases it's not\nso much that they lack the appetite for work, but that the work\nthey're offered is unappetizing.<br/><br/>The experience of the SFP suggests that if you let motivated people\ndo real work, they work hard, whatever their age.  As one of the\nfounders said \"I'd read that starting a startup consumed your life,  \nbut I had no idea what that meant until I did it.\"<br/><br/>I'd feel guilty if I were a boss making people work this hard.  But\nwe're not these people's bosses.  They're working on their own\nprojects.  And what makes them work is not us but their competitors.\nLike good athletes, they don't work hard because the coach yells\nat them, but because they want to win.<br/><br/>We have less power than bosses, and yet the founders work harder  \nthan employees.  It seems like a win for everyone.  The only catch\nis that we get on average only about 5-7% of the upside, while an\nemployer gets nearly all of it.  (We're counting on it being 5-7%\nof a much larger number.)<br/><br/>As well as working hard, the groups all turned out to be extraordinarily\nresponsible.  I can't think of a time when one failed to do something\nthey'd promised to, even by being late for an appointment.  This\nis another lesson the world has yet to learn.  One of the founders\ndiscovered that the hardest part of arranging a meeting with\nexecutives at a big cell phone carrier was getting a rental company\nto rent him a car, because he was too young.<br/><br/>I think the problem here is much the same as with the apparent\nlaziness of people this age.  They seem lazy because the work they're\ngiven is pointless, and they act irresponsible because they're not\ngiven any power.  Some of them, anyway.  We only have a sample size\nof about twenty, but it seems so far that if you let people in their\nearly twenties be their own bosses, they rise to the occasion.<br/><br/><b>Morale</b><br/><br/>The summer founders were as a rule very idealistic.  They also  \nwanted very much to get rich.  These qualities might seem incompatible,\nbut they're not.  These guys want to get rich, but they want to do\nit by changing the world.  They wouldn't (well, seven of the eight\ngroups wouldn't) be interested in making money by speculating in\nstocks.  They want to make something people use.<br/><br/>I think this makes them more effective as founders.  As hard as  \npeople will work for money, they'll work harder for a cause.  And   \nsince success in a startup depends so much on motivation, the\nparadoxical result is that the people likely to make the most money\nare those who aren't in it just for the money.<br/><br/>The founders of <a href=\"http://kiko.com\">Kiko</a>, for example,   \nare working on an Ajax calendar.  They want to get rich, but they\npay more attention to design than they would if that were their\nonly motivation.  You can tell just by looking at it.<br/><br/>I never considered it till this summer, but this might be another\nreason startups run by hackers tend to do better than those run by\nMBAs.  Perhaps it's not just that hackers understand technology\nbetter, but that they're driven by more powerful motivations.\nMicrosoft, as I've said before, is a dangerously misleading example.  \nTheir mean corporate culture only works for monopolies.   \nGoogle is a better model.<br/><br/>Considering that the summer founders are the sharks in this ocean,\nwe were surprised how frightened most of them were of competitors.\nBut now that I think of it, we were just as frightened when we\nstarted Viaweb.  For the first year, our initial reaction to news \nof a competitor was always: we're doomed.  Just as a hypochondriac\nmagnifies his symptoms till he's convinced he has some terrible\ndisease, when you're not used to competitors you magnify them into\nmonsters.<br/><br/>Here's a handy rule for startups: competitors are rarely as dangerous\nas they seem.  Most will self-destruct before you can destroy them.\nAnd it certainly doesn't matter how many of them there are, any\nmore than it matters to the winner of a marathon how many runners\nare behind him.<br/><br/>\"It's a crowded market,\" I remember one founder saying worriedly.<br/><br/>\"Are you the current leader?\" I asked.<br/><br/>\"Yes.\"<br/><br/>\"Is anyone able to develop software faster than you?\"<br/><br/>\"Probably not.\"<br/><br/>\"Well, if you're ahead now, and you're the fastest, then you'll\nstay ahead.  What difference does it make how many others there\nare?\"<br/><br/>Another group was worried when they realized they had to rewrite\ntheir software from scratch.  I told them it would be a bad sign\nif they didn't.  The main function of your initial version is to  \nbe rewritten.<br/><br/>That's why we advise groups to ignore issues like scalability,\ninternationalization, and heavy-duty security at first. [1] I can\nimagine an advocate of \"best practices\" saying these ought to be\nconsidered from the start.  And he'd be right, except that they\ninterfere with the primary function of software in a startup: to  \nbe a vehicle for experimenting with its own design.  Having to\nretrofit internationalization or scalability is a pain, certainly.  \nThe only bigger pain is not needing to, because your initial version\nwas too big and rigid to evolve into something users wanted.<br/><br/>I suspect this is another reason startups beat big companies.\nStartups can be irresponsible and release version 1s that are light\nenough to evolve.  In big companies, all the pressure is in the   \ndirection of over-engineering.<br/><br/><b>What Got Learned</b><br/><br/>One thing we were curious about this summer was where these groups  \nwould need help.  That turned out to vary a lot.  Some we helped\nwith technical advice-- for example, about how to set up an application\nto run on multiple servers.  Most we helped with strategy questions,\nlike what to patent, and what to charge for and what to give away.\nNearly all wanted advice about dealing with future investors: how  \nmuch money should they take and what kind of terms should they\nexpect?<br/><br/>However, all the groups quickly learned how to deal with stuff like\npatents and investors.  These problems aren't intrinsically difficult,\njust unfamiliar.<br/><br/>It was surprising-- slightly frightening even-- how fast they\nlearned.  The weekend before the demo day for investors, we had a  \npractice session where all the groups gave their presentations.  \nThey were all terrible.  We tried to explain how to make them better,\nbut we didn't have much hope.  So on demo day I told the assembled\nangels and VCs that these guys were hackers, not MBAs, and so while\ntheir software was good, we should not expect slick presentations \nfrom them.<br/><br/>The groups then proceeded to give fabulously slick presentations. \nGone were the mumbling recitations of lists of features.   It was\nas if they'd spent the past week at acting school.  I still don't \nknow how they did it.<br/><br/>Perhaps watching each others' presentations helped them see what\nthey'd been doing wrong.  Just as happens in college, the summer   \nfounders learned a lot from one another-- maybe more than they\nlearned from us.  A lot of the problems they face are the same,  \nfrom dealing with investors to hacking Javascript.<br/><br/>I don't want to give the impression there were no problems this  \nsummer.  A lot went wrong, as usually happens with startups.  One\ngroup got an \"<a href=\"http://www.ventureblog.com/articles/indiv/2003/000024.html\">exploding\nterm-sheet</a>\" from some VCs.  Pretty much all the groups who had\ndealings with big companies found that big companies do everything\ninfinitely slowly.  (This is to be expected.  If big companies\nweren't incapable, there would be no room for startups to exist.)\nAnd of course there were the usual nightmares associated with\nservers.  <!-- When Kiko's server went down after they got slashdotted,\nthe guy in charge of the server was in China and had to fix it from\nthere. --><br/><br/>In short, the disasters this summer were just the usual childhood\ndiseases.  Some of this summer's eight startups will   \nprobably die eventually; it would be extraordinary if all eight \nsucceeded.  But what kills them will not be dramatic, external    \nthreats, but a mundane, internal one: not getting enough done.<br/><br/>So far, though, the news is all good.  In fact, we were surprised\nhow much fun the summer was for us.  The main reason was how much\nwe liked the founders.  They're so earnest and hard-working.  They\nseem to like us too.  And this illustrates another advantage of\ninvesting over hiring: our relationship with them is way better   \nthan it would be between a boss and an employee.  Y Combinator ends\nup being more like an older brother than a parent.<br/><br/>I was surprised how much time I spent making introductions.\nFortunately I discovered that when a startup needed to talk to\nsomeone, I could usually get to the right person by at most one\nhop.  I remember wondering, how did my friends get to be so eminent?\nand a second later realizing: shit, I'm forty.<br/><br/>Another surprise was that the three-month batch format,\nwhich we were forced into by the constraints of the summer, turned\nout to be an advantage.  When we started Y Combinator, we planned\nto invest the way other venture firms do: as proposals came in,     \nwe'd evaluate them and decide yes or no.  The SFP\nwas just an experiment to get things started.  But it worked so\nwell that we plan to do \n<a href=\"http://ycombinator.com/funding.html\">all</a> \nour investing this way, one cycle in\nthe summer and one in winter.  It's more efficient for us, and\nbetter for the startups too.<br/><br/>Several groups said our weekly dinners saved them from a common\nproblem afflicting startups: working so hard that one has no social\nlife.  (I remember that part all too well.)  This way, they were\nguaranteed a social event at least once a week.<br/><br/><b>Independence</b><br/><br/>I've heard Y Combinator described as an \"incubator.\"  Actually we're\nthe opposite: incubators exert more control than ordinary VCs, and\nwe make a point of exerting less.  Among other things, incubators\nusually make you work in their office-- that's where the \nword \"incubator\" comes from.  That seems the wrong model.  If\ninvestors get too involved, they smother one of the most powerful \nforces in a startup: the feeling that it's your own company.<br/><br/>Incubators were conspicuous failures during the Bubble.  There's  \nstill debate about whether this was because of the Bubble, or because\nthey're a bad idea.  My vote is they're a bad idea.  I think they \nfail because they select for the wrong people.  When we were starting\na startup, we would never have taken funding from an \"incubator.\"\nWe can find office space, thanks; just give us the money.  And  \npeople with that attitude are the ones likely to succeed in startups.<br/><br/>Indeed, one quality all the founders shared this summer was a spirit\nof independence.  I've been wondering about that.  Are some people\njust a lot more independent than others, or would everyone be this\nway if they were allowed to?<br/><br/>As with most nature/nurture questions, the answer is probably: some\nof each.  But my main conclusion from the summer is that there's\nmore environment in the mix than most people realize.  I could see\nthat from how the founders' attitudes <i>changed</i> during the   \nsummer.  Most were emerging from twenty or so years of being told\nwhat to do.  They seemed a little surprised at having total freedom.\nBut they grew into it really quickly; some of these guys now seem\nabout four inches taller (metaphorically) than they did at the\nbeginning of the summer.<br/><br/>When we asked the summer founders what surprised them most about\nstarting a company, one said \"the most shocking thing is that it \nworked.\"<br/><br/>It will take more experience to know for sure, but my guess is that\na lot of hackers could do this-- that if you put people in a position\nof independence, they develop the qualities they need.  Throw them\noff a cliff, and most will find on the way down that they have   \nwings.<br/><br/>The reason this is news to anyone is that the same forces work in\nthe other direction too. Most hackers are \nemployees, and this <a href=\"http://software.ericsink.com/entries/No_Great_Hackers.html\">molds</a>\nyou into someone to whom starting a startup seems impossible as\nsurely as starting a startup molds you into someone who can handle\nit.<br/><br/>If I'm right, \"hacker\" will mean something different in twenty years\nthan it does now. Increasingly it will mean the people who run the\ncompany.  Y Combinator is just accelerating a process that would\nhave happened anyway.  Power is shifting from the people who deal\nwith money to the people who create technology, and if our experience\nthis summer is any guide, this will be a good thing.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[1] By heavy-duty security I mean efforts to protect against truly\ndetermined attackers.<br/><br/>The <a href=\"https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/sfptable.jpg?t=1688221954&amp;\">image</a>\nshows us, the 2005 summer founders, and Smartleaf\nco-founders Mark Nitzberg and Olin Shivers at the 30-foot table \nKate Courteau designed for us.
