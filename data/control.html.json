He said VCs told him this almost never happened.<br/><br/>Ten years ago that was true.  In the past, founders rarely kept\ncontrol of the board through a series A.  The traditional series A\nboard consisted of two founders, two VCs, and one independent member.\nMore recently the recipe is often one founder, one VC, and one\nindependent.  In either case the founders lose their majority.<br/><br/>But not always.  Mark Zuckerberg kept control of Facebook's board\nthrough the series A and still has it today.  Mark Pincus has kept\ncontrol of Zynga's too.  But are these just outliers?  How common\nis it for founders to keep control after an A round?  I'd heard of\nseveral cases among the companies we've funded, but I wasn't sure\nhow many there were, so I emailed the ycfounders list.<br/><br/>The replies surprised me.  In a dozen companies we've funded, the\nfounders still had a majority of the board seats after the series\nA round.<br/><br/>I feel like we're at a tipping point here.  A lot of VCs still act\nas if founders retaining board control after a series A is unheard-of.\nA lot of them try to make you feel bad if you even ask â€” as if\nyou're a noob or a control freak for wanting such a thing.  But the\nfounders I heard from aren't noobs or control freaks.  Or if they\nare, they are, like Mark Zuckerberg, the kind of noobs and control\nfreaks VCs should be trying to fund more of.<br/><br/>Founders retaining control after a series A is clearly heard-of.\nAnd barring financial catastrophe, I think in the coming year it\nwill become the norm.<br/><br/>Control of a company is a more complicated matter than simply\noutvoting other parties in board meetings.  Investors usually get\nvetos over certain big decisions, like selling the company, regardless\nof how many board seats they have.  And board votes are rarely\nsplit.  Matters are decided in the discussion preceding the vote,\nnot in the vote itself, which is usually unanimous.  But if opinion\nis divided in such discussions, the side that knows it would lose\nin a vote will tend to be less insistent.  That's what board control\nmeans in practice.  You don't simply get to do whatever you want;\nthe board still has to act in the interest of the shareholders; but\nif you have a majority of board seats, then your opinion about\nwhat's in the interest of the shareholders will tend to prevail.<br/><br/>So while board control is not total control, it's not imaginary\neither.  There's inevitably a difference in how things feel within\nthe company.  Which means if it becomes the norm for founders to\nretain board control after a series A, that will change the way\nthings feel in the whole startup world.<br/><br/>The switch to the new norm may be surprisingly fast, because the\nstartups that can retain control tend to be the best ones.  They're\nthe ones that set the trends, both for other startups and for VCs.<br/><br/>A lot of the reason VCs are harsh when negotiating with startups\nis that they're embarrassed to go back to their partners looking\nlike they got beaten.  When they sign a termsheet, they want to be\nable to brag about the good terms they got.  A lot of them don't\ncare that much personally about whether founders keep board control.\nThey just don't want to seem like they had to make concessions.\nWhich means if letting the founders keep control stops being perceived\nas a concession, it will rapidly become much more common.<br/><br/>Like a lot of changes that have been forced on VCs, this change\nwon't turn out to be as big a problem as they might think. VCs will\nstill be able to convince; they just won't be able to compel.  And\nthe startups where they have to resort to compulsion are not the\nones that matter anyway.  VCs make most of their money from a few\nbig hits, and those aren't them.<br/><br/>Knowing that founders will keep control of the board may even help\nVCs pick better.  If they know they can't fire the founders, they'll\nhave to choose founders they can trust.  And that's who they should\nhave been choosing all along.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, John Bautista, Trevor Blackwell, Paul\nBuchheit, Brian Chesky, Bill Clerico, Patrick Collison, Adam\nGoldstein, James Lindenbaum, Jessica Livingston, and Fred Wilson\nfor reading drafts of this.<br/><br/></br></p></font>","date":"2010-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
