{"href":"microsoft.html","title":"Microsoft is Dead","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">April 2007<br/><br/>A few days ago I suddenly realized Microsoft was dead.  I was talking\nto a young startup founder about how Google was different from\nYahoo.  I said that Yahoo had been warped from the start by\ntheir fear of Microsoft.  That was why they'd positioned themselves\nas a \"media company\" instead of a technology company.  Then I looked\nat his face and realized he didn't understand.  It was as if I'd\ntold him how much girls liked Barry Manilow in the mid\n80s.  Barry who?<br/><br/>Microsoft?  He didn't say anything, but I could tell he didn't quite\nbelieve anyone would be frightened of them.<br/><br/>Microsoft cast\na shadow over the software world for almost 20 years\nstarting in the late 80s.\nI can remember when it was IBM before them.  I mostly ignored this\nshadow.  I never used Microsoft software, so it only affected me\nindirectly—for example, in the spam I got from botnets.  And\nbecause I wasn't paying attention, I didn't notice when the shadow\ndisappeared.<br/><br/>But it's gone now.  I can sense that.  No one is even afraid of\nMicrosoft anymore.  They still make a lot of money—so does IBM,\nfor that matter.  But they're not dangerous.<br/><br/>When did Microsoft die, and of what?  I know they seemed dangerous\nas late as 2001, because I wrote an <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/road.html\">essay</a> then \nabout how they were\nless dangerous than they seemed.   I'd guess they were dead by 2005.\nI know when we started Y Combinator we didn't worry about Microsoft\nas competition for the startups we funded.  In fact, we've never\neven invited them to the demo days we organize for startups to\npresent to investors.  We invite Yahoo and Google and some other\nInternet companies, but we've never bothered to invite Microsoft.\nNor has anyone there ever even sent us an email.  They're in a\ndifferent world.<br/><br/>What killed them?  Four things, I think, all of them occurring\nsimultaneously in the mid 2000s.<br/><br/>The most obvious is Google.  There can only be one big man in town,\nand they're clearly it.  Google is the most dangerous company\nnow by far, in both the good and bad senses of the word.  Microsoft\ncan at best <a href=\"http://live.com\">limp</a> along afterward.<br/><br/>When did Google take the lead?  There will be a tendency to push\nit back to their IPO in August 2004, but they weren't setting the\nterms of the debate then.  I'd say they took the lead in\n2005.  Gmail was one of the things that put them over the edge.\nGmail showed they could do more than search.<br/><br/>Gmail also showed how much you could do with web-based software,\nif you took advantage of what later came to be called \"Ajax.\" And\nthat was the second cause of Microsoft's death: everyone can see the\ndesktop is over.  It now seems inevitable that applications will\nlive on the web—not just email, but everything, right up to\n<a href=\"http://snipshot.com\">Photoshop</a>.  Even Microsoft sees that now.<br/><br/>Ironically, Microsoft unintentionally helped create Ajax.  The x\nin Ajax is from the XMLHttpRequest object, which lets the browser\ncommunicate with the server in the background while displaying a page.\n(Originally the only way to communicate with the server was to \nask for a new page.) XMLHttpRequest was created by Microsoft in the late 90s\nbecause they needed it for Outlook.  What they didn't realize was\nthat it would be useful to a lot of other people too—in fact, to\nanyone who wanted to make web apps work like desktop ones.<br/><br/>The other critical component of Ajax is Javascript, the programming\nlanguage that runs in the browser.  Microsoft saw the danger of\nJavascript and tried to keep it broken for as long as they could.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/microsoft.html#f1n\"><font color=\"#777777\">1</font></a>]</font> \nBut eventually the open source world won, by producing\nJavascript libraries that grew over the brokenness of Explorer\nthe way a tree grows over barbed wire.<br/><br/>The third cause of Microsoft's death was broadband Internet.  Anyone\nwho cares can have fast Internet access\nnow.  And the bigger the pipe to the server, the less you need the\ndesktop.<br/><br/>The last nail in the coffin came, of all places, from Apple.  \nThanks to OS X, Apple has come back from the dead in a way\nthat is extremely rare in technology.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/microsoft.html#f2n\"><font color=\"#777777\">2</font></a>]</font>\nTheir victory is so complete that I'm now surprised when I come across\na computer running Windows.  Nearly all the people we fund at Y\nCombinator use Apple laptops.  It was the same in the audience at \n<a href=\"http://www.bosstalks.com/StartupSchool2007/all_macs_and_all_writing.jpg\">startup\nschool</a>.  All the computer people use Macs or Linux now.  Windows is for\ngrandmas, like Macs used to be in the 90s.  So not only does the\ndesktop no longer matter, no one who cares about computers uses\nMicrosoft's anyway.<br/><br/>And of course Apple has Microsoft on the run in music\ntoo, with TV and phones on the way.<br/><br/>I'm glad Microsoft is dead.  They were like Nero or \nCommodus—evil\nin the way only inherited power can make you.  Because remember,\nthe Microsoft monopoly didn't begin with Microsoft.  They got it\nfrom IBM.  The software business was overhung by a\nmonopoly from about the mid-1950s to about 2005.  For practically\nits whole existence, that is.  One of the reasons \"Web 2.0\" has\nsuch an air of euphoria about it is the feeling, conscious or not,\nthat this era of monopoly may finally be over.<br/><br/>Of course, as a hacker I can't help thinking about how something\nbroken could be fixed.  Is there some way Microsoft could come back?\nIn principle, yes.  To see how, envision two things: (a) the amount\nof cash Microsoft now has on hand, and (b) Larry and Sergey making\nthe rounds of all the search engines ten years ago trying to sell\nthe idea for Google for a million dollars, and being turned down\nby everyone.<br/><br/>The surprising fact is, brilliant hackers—dangerously brilliant\nhackers—can be had very cheaply, by the standards of a\ncompany as rich as Microsoft.  They can't \n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/hiring.html\">hire</a> smart people anymore,\nbut they could buy as many as they wanted for only an order of magnitude \nmore. So if they wanted to be a contender\nagain, this is how they could do it:\n<ol>\n<li> Buy all the good \"Web 2.0\" startups.  They could get substantially\n    all of them for less than they'd have to pay for Facebook.<br/><br/><li> Put them all in a building in Silicon Valley, surrounded by\n    lead shielding to protect them from any contact with Redmond.\n</li></li></ol>\nI feel safe suggesting this, because they'd never do it.  Microsoft's\nbiggest weakness is that they still don't realize how much they\nsuck.  They still think they can write software in house.  Maybe they\ncan, by the standards of the desktop world.  But that world ended\na few years ago.<br/><br/>I already know what the reaction to this essay will be.  Half the\nreaders will say that Microsoft is still an enormously profitable\ncompany, and that I should be more\ncareful about drawing conclusions based on what a few people think\nin our insular little \"Web 2.0\" bubble.  The other half, the younger\nhalf, will complain that this is old news.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>See also:</b> <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/cliffsnotes.html\">Microsoft is Dead: the Cliffs Notes</a><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nIt doesn't take a conscious effort to make software incompatible.\nAll you have to do is not work too hard at fixing bugs—which, if\nyou're a big company, you produce in copious quantities.
