{"href":"prop62.html","title":"This Year We Can End the Death Penalty in California","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">November 2016<br/><br/>If you're a California voter, there is an important proposition\non your ballot this year: Proposition 62, which bans the death\npenalty.<br/><br/>When I was younger I used to think the debate about the death\npenalty was about when it's ok to take a human life.  Is it ok\nto kill a killer?<br/><br/>But that is not the issue here.<br/><br/>The real world does not work like the version I was shown on TV growing up.  The police \noften arrest the wrong person.\nDefendants' lawyers are often incompetent.  And prosecutors\nare often motivated more by publicity than justice.<br/><br/>In the real world,       \n<a href=\"http://time.com/79572/more-innocent-people-on-death-row-than-estimated-study/\">about 4%</a> of people sentenced to death\nare innocent.\nSo this is not about whether it's ok to kill killers. This\nis about whether it's ok to kill innocent people.<br/><br/>A child could answer that one for you.<br/><br/>This year, in California, you have a chance to end this, by\nvoting yes on Proposition 62. But beware, because there is another \nproposition, Proposition 66, whose goal is to make it \neasier to execute people. So yes on 62, no on 66.<br/><br/>It's time.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2016-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
