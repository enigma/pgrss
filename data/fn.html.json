{"href":"fn.html","title":"Fierce Nerds","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">May 2021<br/><br/>Most people think of nerds as quiet, diffident people. In ordinary\nsocial situations they are — as quiet and diffident as the star\nquarterback would be if he found himself in the middle of a physics\nsymposium. And for the same reason: they are fish out of water.\nBut the apparent diffidence of nerds is an illusion due to the fact\nthat when non-nerds observe them, it's usually in ordinary social\nsituations. In fact some nerds are quite fierce.<br/><br/>The fierce nerds are a small but interesting group. They are as a\nrule extremely competitive — more competitive, I'd say, than highly\ncompetitive non-nerds. Competition is more personal for them. Partly\nperhaps because they're not emotionally mature enough to distance\nthemselves from it, but also because there's less randomness in the\nkinds of competition they engage in, and they are thus more justified\nin taking the results personally.<br/><br/>Fierce nerds also tend to be somewhat overconfident, especially\nwhen young. It might seem like it would be a disadvantage to be\nmistaken about one's abilities, but empirically it isn't. Up to a\npoint, confidence is a self-fullfilling prophecy.<br/><br/>Another quality you find in most fierce nerds is intelligence. Not\nall nerds are smart, but the fierce ones are always at least\nmoderately so. If they weren't, they wouldn't have the confidence\nto be fierce.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"#f1n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>There's also a natural connection between nerdiness and\n<a href=\"think.html\"><u>independent-mindedness</u></a>. It's hard to be \nindependent-minded without\nbeing somewhat socially awkward, because conventional beliefs are\nso often mistaken, or at least arbitrary. No one who was both\nindependent-minded and ambitious would want to waste the effort it\ntakes to fit in. And the independent-mindedness of the fierce nerds\nwill obviously be of the <a href=\"conformism.html\"><u>aggressive</u></a> \nrather than the passive type:\nthey'll be annoyed by rules, rather than dreamily unaware of them.<br/><br/>I'm less sure why fierce nerds are impatient, but most seem to be.\nYou notice it first in conversation, where they tend to interrupt\nyou. This is merely annoying, but in the more promising fierce nerds\nit's connected to a deeper impatience about solving problems. Perhaps\nthe competitiveness and impatience of fierce nerds are not separate \nqualities, but two manifestations of a single underlying drivenness.<br/><br/>When you combine all these qualities in sufficient quantities, the\nresult is quite formidable. The most vivid example of fierce nerds\nin action may be James Watson's <i>The Double Helix</i>. The first sentence\nof the book is \"I have never seen Francis Crick in a modest mood,\"\nand the portrait he goes on to paint of Crick is the quintessential\nfierce nerd: brilliant, socially awkward, competitive, independent-minded,\noverconfident. But so is the implicit portrait he paints of himself.\nIndeed, his lack of social awareness makes both portraits that much\nmore realistic, because he baldly states all sorts of opinions and\nmotivations that a smoother person would conceal. And moreover it's\nclear from the story that Crick and Watson's fierce nerdiness was\nintegral to their success. Their independent-mindedness caused them\nto consider approaches that most others ignored, their overconfidence\nallowed them to work on problems they only half understood (they\nwere literally described as \"clowns\" by one eminent insider), and\ntheir impatience and competitiveness got them to the answer ahead\nof two other groups that would otherwise have found it within the\nnext year, if not the next several months.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"#f2n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The idea that there could be fierce nerds is an unfamiliar one not\njust to many normal people but even to some young nerds. Especially\nearly on, nerds spend so much of their time in ordinary social\nsituations and so little doing real work that they get a lot more\nevidence of their awkwardness than their power. So there will be\nsome who read this description of the fierce nerd and realize \"Hmm,\nthat's me.\" And it is to you, young fierce nerd, that I now turn.<br/><br/>I have some good news, and some bad news. The good news is that\nyour fierceness will be a great help in solving difficult problems.\nAnd not just the kind of scientific and technical problems that\nnerds have traditionally solved. As the world progresses, the number\nof things you can win at by getting the right answer increases.\nRecently <a href=\"richnow.html\"><u>getting rich</u></a> became \none of them: 7 of the 8 richest people\nin America are now fierce nerds.<br/><br/>Indeed, being a fierce nerd is probably even more helpful in business\nthan in nerds' original territory of scholarship. Fierceness seems\noptional there. Darwin for example doesn't seem to have been\nespecially fierce. Whereas it's impossible to be the CEO of a company\nover a certain size without being fierce, so now that nerds can win\nat business, fierce nerds will increasingly monopolize the really\nbig successes.<br/><br/>The bad news is that if it's not exercised, your fierceness will\nturn to bitterness, and you will become an intellectual playground\nbully: the grumpy sysadmin, the forum troll, the \n<a href=\"fh.html\"><u>hater</u></a>, the shooter\ndown of <a href=\"newideas.html\"><u>new ideas</u></a>.<br/><br/>How do you avoid this fate? Work on ambitious projects. If you\nsucceed, it will bring you a kind of satisfaction that neutralizes\nbitterness. But you don't need to have succeeded to feel this;\nmerely working on hard projects gives most fierce nerds some\nfeeling of satisfaction. And those it doesn't, it at least keeps\nbusy.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"#f3n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">3</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Another solution may be to somehow turn off your fierceness, by\ndevoting yourself to meditation or psychotherapy or something like\nthat. Maybe that's the right answer for some people. I have no idea.\nBut it doesn't seem the optimal solution to me. If you're given a\nsharp knife, it seems to me better to use it than to blunt its edge\nto avoid cutting yourself.<br/><br/>If you do choose the ambitious route, you'll have a tailwind behind\nyou. There has never been a better time to be a nerd. In the past\ncentury we've seen a continuous transfer of power from dealmakers\nto technicians — from the charismatic to the competent — and I\ndon't see anything on the horizon that will end it. At least not\ntill the nerds end it themselves by bringing about the singularity.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nTo be a nerd is to be socially awkward, and there are two\ndistinct ways to do that: to be playing the same game as everyone\nelse, but badly, and to be playing a different game. The smart nerds\nare the latter type.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nThe same qualities that make fierce nerds so effective can\nalso make them very annoying. Fierce nerds would do well to remember\nthis, and (a) try to keep a lid on it, and (b) seek out organizations\nand types of work where getting the right answer matters more than\npreserving social harmony. In practice that means small groups\nworking on hard problems. Which fortunately is the most fun kind\nof environment anyway.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nIf success neutralizes bitterness, why are there some people\nwho are at least moderately successful and yet still quite bitter?\nBecause people's potential bitterness varies depending on how\nnaturally bitter their personality is, and how ambitious they are:\nsomeone who's naturally very bitter will still have a lot left after\nsuccess neutralizes some of it, and someone who's very ambitious\nwill need proportionally more success to satisfy that ambition.<br/><br/>So the worst-case scenario is someone who's both naturally bitter\nand extremely ambitious, and yet only moderately successful.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Steve Blank, Patrick Collison, Jessica\nLivingston, Amjad Masad, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2021-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
