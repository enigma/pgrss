{"href":"jessica.html","title":"Jessica Livingston","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">November 2015<br/><br/>A few months ago an article about Y Combinator said that early on\nit had been a \"one-man show.\"  It's sadly common to read that sort\nof thing.  But the problem with that description is not just that\nit's unfair.  It's also misleading.  Much of what's most novel about\nYC is due to Jessica Livingston.  If you don't understand her, you\ndon't understand YC.  So let me tell you a little about Jessica.<br/><br/>YC had 4 founders.  Jessica and I decided one night to start it,\nand the next day we recruited my friends Robert Morris and Trevor\nBlackwell.  Jessica and I ran YC day to day, and Robert and Trevor\nread applications and did interviews with us.<br/><br/>Jessica and I were already dating when we started YC.  At first we\ntried to act \"professional\" about this, meaning we tried to conceal\nit.  In retrospect that seems ridiculous, and we soon dropped the\npretense.  And the fact that Jessica and I were a couple is a big\npart of what made YC what it was.  YC felt like a family.  The\nfounders early on were mostly young.  We all had dinner together\nonce a week, cooked for the first couple years by me. Our first\nbuilding had been a private home.  The overall atmosphere was\nshockingly different from a VC's office on Sand Hill Road, in a way\nthat was entirely for the better.  There was an authenticity that\neveryone who walked in could sense.  And that didn't just mean that\npeople trusted us.  It was the perfect quality to instill in startups.\nAuthenticity is one of the most important things YC looks for in\nfounders, not just because fakers and opportunists are annoying,\nbut because authenticity is one of the main things that separates\nthe most successful startups from the rest.<br/><br/>Early YC was a family, and Jessica was its mom.  And the culture\nshe defined was one of YC's most important innovations.  Culture\nis important in any organization, but at YC culture wasn't just how\nwe behaved when we built the product. At YC, the culture was the\nproduct.<br/><br/>Jessica was also the mom in another sense: she had the last word.\nEverything we did as an organization went through her \nto fund, what to say to the public, how to deal with other companies,\nwho to hire, everything.<br/><br/>Before we had kids, YC was more or less our life. There was no real\ndistinction between working hours and not.  We talked about YC all\nthe time.  And while there might be some businesses that it would\nbe tedious to let infect your private life, we liked it. We'd started\nYC because it was something we were interested in.  And some of the\nproblems we were trying to solve were endlessly difficult.  How do\nyou recognize good founders?  You could talk about that for years,\nand we did; we still do.<br/><br/>I'm better at some things than Jessica, and she's better at some\nthings than me.  One of the things she's best at is judging people.\nShe's one of those rare individuals with x-ray vision for character.\nShe can see through any kind of faker almost immediately.  Her\nnickname within YC was the Social Radar, and this special power of\nhers was critical in making YC what it is.  The earlier you pick\nstartups, the more you're picking the founders.  Later stage investors\nget to try products and look at growth numbers.  At the stage where\nYC invests, there is often neither a product nor any numbers.<br/><br/>Others thought YC had some special insight about the future of\ntechnology.  Mostly we had the same sort of insight Socrates claimed:\nwe at least knew we knew nothing.  What made YC successful was being\nable to pick good founders.  We thought Airbnb was a bad idea.  We\nfunded it because we liked the founders.<br/><br/>During interviews, Robert and Trevor and I would pepper the applicants\nwith technical questions.  Jessica would mostly watch.  A lot of\nthe applicants probably read her as some kind of secretary, especially\nearly on, because she was the one who'd go out and get each new\ngroup and she didn't ask many questions. She was ok with that.  It\nwas easier for her to watch people if they didn't notice her. But\nafter the interview, the three of us would turn to Jessica and ask\n\"What does the Social Radar say?\"\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/jessica.html#f1n\"><font color=\"#999999\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Having the Social Radar at interviews wasn't just how we picked\nfounders who'd be successful.  It was also how we picked founders\nwho were good people.  At first we did this because we couldn't\nhelp it.  Imagine what it would feel like to have x-ray vision for\ncharacter.  Being around bad people would be intolerable.  So we'd\nrefuse to fund founders whose characters we had doubts about even\nif we thought they'd be successful.<br/><br/>Though we initially did this out of self-indulgence, it turned out\nto be very valuable to YC.  We didn't realize it in the beginning,\nbut the people we were picking would become the YC alumni network.\nAnd once we picked them, unless they did something really egregious,\nthey were going to be part of it for life. Some now think YC's\nalumni network is its most valuable feature. I personally think\nYC's advice is pretty good too, but the alumni network is certainly\namong the most valuable features.  The level of trust and helpfulness\nis remarkable for a group of such size.  And Jessica is the main\nreason why.<br/><br/>(As we later learned, it probably cost us little to reject people\nwhose characters we had doubts about, because how good founders are\nand how well they do are <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/mean.html\"><u>not orthogonal</u></a>.  If bad founders succeed\nat all, they tend to sell early.  The most successful founders are\nalmost all good.)<br/><br/>If Jessica was so important to YC, why don't more people realize\nit?  Partly because I'm a writer, and writers always get disproportionate\nattention.  YC's brand was initially my brand, and our applicants\nwere people who'd read my essays.  But there is another reason:\nJessica hates attention.  Talking to reporters makes her nervous.\nThe thought of giving a talk paralyzes her.  She was even uncomfortable\nat our wedding, because the bride is always the center of attention.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/jessica.html#f2n\"><font color=\"#999999\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>It's not just because she's shy that she hates attention, but because\nit throws off the Social Radar. She can't be herself. You can't\nwatch people when everyone is watching you.<br/><br/>Another reason attention worries her is that she hates bragging.\nIn anything she does that's publicly visible, her biggest fear\n(after the obvious fear that it will be bad) is that it will seem\nostentatious.  She says being too modest is a common problem for\nwomen.  But in her case it goes beyond that.  She has a horror of\nostentation so visceral it's almost a phobia.<br/><br/>She also hates fighting. She can't do it; she just shuts down.  And\nunfortunately there is a good deal of fighting in being the public\nface of an organization.<br/><br/>So although Jessica more than anyone made YC unique, the very\nqualities that enabled her to do it mean she tends to get written\nout of YC's history.  Everyone buys this story that PG started YC\nand his wife just kind of helped.  Even YC's haters buy it.  A\ncouple years ago when people were attacking us for not funding more\nfemale founders (than exist), they all treated YC as identical with\nPG.  It would have spoiled the narrative to acknowledge Jessica's\ncentral role at YC.<br/><br/>Jessica was boiling mad that people were accusing <i>her</i> company of\nsexism. I've never seen her angrier about anything.  But she did\nnot contradict them.  Not publicly.  In private there was a great\ndeal of profanity.  And she wrote three separate essays about the\nquestion of female founders.  But she could never bring herself to\npublish any of them.  She'd seen the level of vitriol in this debate,\nand she shrank from engaging.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/jessica.html#f3n\"><font color=\"#999999\">3</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>It wasn't just because she disliked fighting.  She's so sensitive\nto character that it repels her even to fight with dishonest people.\nThe idea of mixing it up with linkbait journalists or Twitter trolls\nwould seem to her not merely frightening, but disgusting.<br/><br/>But Jessica knew her example as a successful female founder would\nencourage more women to start companies, so last year she did\nsomething YC had never done before and hired a PR firm to get her\nsome interviews.  At one of the first she did, the reporter brushed\naside her insights about startups and turned it into a sensationalistic\nstory about how some guy had tried to chat her up as she was waiting\noutside the bar where they had arranged to meet.  Jessica was\nmortified, partly because the guy had done nothing wrong, but more\nbecause the story treated her as a victim significant only for being\na woman, rather than one of the most knowledgeable investors in the\nValley.<br/><br/>After that she told the PR firm to stop.<br/><br/>You're not going to be hearing in the press about what Jessica has\nachieved. So let me tell you what Jessica has achieved.  \nis fundamentally a nexus of people, like a university. It doesn't\nmake a product. What defines it is the people.  Jessica more than\nanyone curated and nurtured that collection of people.  In that\nsense she literally made YC.<br/><br/>Jessica knows more about the qualities of startup founders than\nanyone else ever has. Her immense data set and x-ray vision are the\nperfect storm in that respect.  The qualities of the founders are\nthe best predictor of how a startup will do.  And startups are in\nturn the most important source of growth in mature economies.<br/><br/>The person who knows the most about the most important factor in\nthe growth of mature economies — that is who Jessica Livingston is.\nDoesn't that sound like someone who should be better known?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nHarj Taggar reminded me that while Jessica didn't ask many\nquestions, they tended to be important ones:<br/><br/>\"She was always good at sniffing out any red flags about the team\nor their determination and disarmingly asking the right question,\nwhich usually revealed more than the founders realized.\"<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nOr more precisely, while she likes getting attention in the\nsense of getting credit for what she has done, she doesn't like\ngetting attention in the sense of being watched in real time.\nUnfortunately, not just for her but for a lot of people, how much\nyou get of the former depends a lot on how much you get of the\nlatter.<br/><br/>Incidentally, if you saw Jessica at a public event, you would never\nguess she\nhates attention, because (a) she is very polite and (b) when she's\nnervous, she expresses it by smiling more.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nThe existence of people like Jessica is not just something\nthe mainstream media needs to learn to acknowledge, but something\nfeminists need to learn to acknowledge as well.  There are successful\nwomen who don't like to fight.  Which means if the public conversation\nabout women consists of fighting, their voices will be silenced.<br/><br/>There's a sort of Gresham's Law of conversations. If a conversation\nreaches a certain level of incivility, the more thoughtful people\nstart to leave. No one understands female founders better than\nJessica.  But it's unlikely anyone will ever hear her speak candidly\nabout the topic. She ventured a toe in that water a while ago, and\nthe reaction was so violent that she decided \"never again.\"<br/><br/>\n<b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Patrick Collison, \nDaniel Gackle, Carolynn\nLevy, Jon Levy, Kirsty Nathoo, Robert Morris, Geoff Ralston, and\nHarj Taggar for reading drafts of this.
