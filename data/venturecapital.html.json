{"href":"venturecapital.html","title":"A Unified Theory of VC Suckage","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">March 2005<br/><br/>A couple months ago I got an email from a recruiter asking if I was\ninterested in being a \"technologist in residence\" at a new venture\ncapital fund.  I think the idea was to play Karl Rove to the VCs'\nGeorge Bush.<br/><br/>I considered it for about four seconds.  Work for a VC fund?  Ick.<br/><br/>One of my most vivid memories from our startup is going to visit\nGreylock, the famous Boston VCs. They were the most arrogant\npeople I've met in my life.  And I've met a lot of arrogant people.\n[1]<br/><br/>I'm not alone in feeling this way, of course.  Even a VC friend of\nmine dislikes VCs.  \"Assholes,\" he says.<br/><br/>But lately I've been learning more about how the VC world works,\n<!--(mostly in order to <a href=\"summerfounder.html\">hack it</a>)-->\nand a few days ago it hit me that there's a reason VCs are the way\nthey are.  It's not so much that the business attracts jerks, or\neven that the power they wield corrupts them.  The real problem is\nthe way they're paid.<br/><br/>The problem with VC funds is that they're <i>funds</i>.  Like the\nmanagers of mutual funds or hedge funds, VCs get paid a percentage\nof the money they manage: about 2% a year in management fees,\nplus a percentage of the gains.  So they want\nthe fund to be huge-- hundreds of millions of dollars, if possible.\nBut that means each partner ends up being responsible for investing\na lot of money.  And since one person can only manage so many deals,\neach deal has to be for multiple millions of dollars.<br/><br/>This turns out to explain nearly all the characteristics of VCs\nthat founders hate.<br/><br/>It explains why VCs take so agonizingly long to make up their minds,\nand why their due diligence feels like a body cavity search. [2]\nWith so much at stake, they have to be paranoid.<br/><br/>It explains why they steal your ideas.  Every founder knows that\nVCs will tell your secrets to your competitors if they end up\ninvesting in them.  It's not unheard of for VCs to meet you when\nthey have no intention of funding you, just to pick your brain for\na competitor.  This prospect makes naive founders clumsily secretive.\nExperienced founders treat it as a cost of doing business.  Either\nway it sucks.  But again, the only reason VCs are so sneaky is the\ngiant deals they do.  With so much at stake, they have to be devious.<br/><br/>It explains why VCs tend to interfere in the companies they invest\nin.  They want to be on your board not just so that they can advise\nyou, but so that they can watch you.  Often they even install a new\nCEO.  Yes, he may have extensive business experience.  But he's\nalso their man: these newly installed CEOs always play something  \nof the role of a political commissar in a Red Army unit.  With\nso much at stake, VCs can't resist micromanaging you.<br/><br/>The huge investments themselves are something founders would dislike,\nif they realized how damaging they can be.  VCs don't invest $x\nmillion because that's the amount you need, but because that's the\namount the structure of their business requires them to invest.  \nLike steroids, these sudden huge investments can do more harm than \ngood.  Google survived enormous VC funding because it could\nlegitimately absorb large amounts of money.  They had to buy a lot\nof servers and a lot of bandwidth to crawl the whole Web.  Less\nfortunate startups just end up hiring armies of people to sit around\nhaving meetings.<br/><br/>In principle you could take a huge VC investment, put it in treasury\nbills, and continue to operate frugally.  You just try it.<br/><br/>And of course giant investments mean giant valuations.  They have\nto, or there's not enough stock left to keep the founders interested.\nYou might think a high valuation is a great thing.  Many founders \ndo.  But you can't eat paper.  You can't benefit from a high valuation\nunless you can somehow achieve what those in the business \n<!-- (with no apparent embarrassment)-->\ncall a \"liquidity event,\" and the higher   \nyour valuation, the narrower your options for doing that.  Many a   \nfounder would be happy to sell his company for $15 million, but VCs\nwho've just invested at a pre-money valuation of $8 million won't\nhear of that.  You're rolling the dice again, whether you like it\nor not.<br/><br/>Back in 1997, one of our competitors raised $20 million in a single \nround of VC funding.  This was at the time more than the valuation\nof our entire company.  Was I worried?  Not at all: I was delighted.\nIt was like watching a car you're chasing turn down a street that\nyou know has no outlet.<br/><br/>Their smartest move at that point would have been to take every \npenny of the $20 million and use it to buy us.  We would have sold.\nTheir investors would have been furious of course.  But I think the  \nmain reason they never considered this was that they never imagined\nwe could be had so cheap.  They probably assumed we were on the\nsame VC gravy train they were.<br/><br/>In fact we only spent about $2 million in our entire existence.   \nAnd that gave us flexibility.  We could sell ourselves to Yahoo for\n$50 million, and everyone was delighted.  If our competitor had\ndone that, the last round of investors would presumably have lost\nmoney.  I assume they could have vetoed such a deal.  But no one  \nthose days was paying a lot more than Yahoo.  So unless their\nfounders could pull off an IPO (which would be difficult with Yahoo\nas a competitor), they had no choice but to ride the thing down.<br/><br/>The puffed-up companies that went public during the Bubble didn't\ndo it just because they were pulled into it by unscrupulous investment \nbankers.  Most were pushed just as hard from the other side by VCs\nwho'd invested at high valuations, leaving an IPO as the only way  \nout.  The only people dumber were retail investors.  So it was\nliterally IPO or bust.  Or rather, IPO then bust, or just bust.<br/><br/>Add up all the evidence of VCs' behavior, and the resulting personality\nis not attractive.  In fact, it's the classic villain: alternately\ncowardly, greedy, sneaky, and overbearing.<br/><br/>I used to take it for granted that VCs were like this. Complaining  \nthat VCs were jerks used to seem as naive to me as complaining that\nusers didn't read the reference manual.  Of course VCs were jerks.\nHow could it be otherwise?<br/><br/>But I realize now that they're not intrinsically jerks.  VCs are  \nlike car salesmen or bureaucrats: the nature of their work\nturns them into jerks.<br/><br/>I've met a few VCs I like.  Mike Moritz seems a good guy.  He even \nhas a sense of humor, which is almost unheard of among VCs.  From  \nwhat I've read about John Doerr, he sounds like a good guy too,  \nalmost a hacker.  But they work for the very best VC funds.  And \nmy theory explains why they'd tend to be different: just as the\nvery most popular kids don't have to persecute \n<a href=\"nerds.html\">nerds</a>, the very best\nVCs don't have to act like VCs.  They get the pick of all the best  \ndeals.  So they don't have to be so paranoid and sneaky, and they \ncan choose those rare companies, like Google, that will actually\nbenefit from the giant sums they're compelled to invest.<br/><br/>VCs often complain that in their business there's too much money\nchasing too few deals.  Few realize that this also describes a flaw\nin the way funding works at the level of individual firms.<br/><br/>Perhaps this was the sort of strategic insight I was supposed to   \ncome up with as a \"technologist in residence.\"  If so, the good\nnews is that they're getting it for free.  The bad news is it\nmeans that if you're not one of the very top funds, you're \ncondemned to be the bad guys.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[1] After Greylock booted founder Philip Greenspun out of ArsDigita,\nhe wrote a hilarious but also very informative\n<a href=\"http://www.waxy.org/random/arsdigita/\">essay</a> about it.\n<!-- comparing \nthe resulting situation to a bunch of\nkids sitting in the cockpit of a 747, flipping switches\nand wondering how to make the thing take off.  He later took this off the\nWeb, but I happen to remember this choice metaphor.--><br/><br/>[2] Since most VCs aren't tech guys, the technology side of their\ndue diligence tends to be like a body cavity search by someone with\na faulty knowledge of human anatomy.  After a while we were quite\nsore from VCs attempting to probe our nonexistent database orifice.<br/><br/>No, we don't use Oracle.  We just store the data in files.  Our\nsecret is to use an OS that doesn't lose our data.  Which OS?\nFreeBSD.  Why do you use that instead of Windows NT?  Because it's\nbetter and it doesn't cost anything.  What, you're using a\n<i>freeware</i> OS?<br/><br/>How many times that conversation was repeated.\nThen when we got to Yahoo, we found they used FreeBSD and stored\ntheir data in files too.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2005-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
