{"href":"words.html","title":"Putting Ideas into Words","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">February 2022<br/><br/>Writing about something, even something you know well, usually shows\nyou that you didn't know it as well as you thought. Putting ideas\ninto words is a severe test. The first words you choose are usually\nwrong; you have to rewrite sentences over and over <!-- if you want --> to\nget them exactly right. And your ideas won't just be imprecise, but\nincomplete too. Half the ideas that end up in an essay will be ones\nyou thought of while you were writing it. Indeed, that's why I write\nthem.<br/><br/>Once you publish something, the convention is that whatever you\nwrote was what you thought before you wrote it. These were your\nideas, and now you've expressed them. But you know this isn't true.\nYou know that putting your ideas into words changed them. And not\njust the ideas you published. Presumably there were others that\nturned out to be too broken to fix, and those you discarded instead.<br/><br/>It's not just having to commit your ideas to specific words that\nmakes writing so exacting. The real test is reading what you've\nwritten. You have to pretend to be a neutral reader who knows nothing\nof what's in your head, only what you wrote. When he reads what you\nwrote, does it seem correct? Does it seem complete? If you make an\neffort, you can read your writing as if you were a complete stranger,\nand when you do the news is usually bad. It takes me many cycles\nbefore I can get an essay past the stranger. But the stranger is\nrational, so you always can, if you ask him what he needs. If he's\nnot satisfied because you failed to mention x or didn't qualify\nsome sentence sufficiently, then you mention x or add more\nqualifications. Happy now? It may cost you some nice sentences, but\nyou have to resign yourself to that. You just have to make them as\ngood as you can and still satisfy the stranger.<br/><br/>This much, I assume, won't be that controversial. I think it will\naccord with the experience of anyone who has tried to write about\nanything nontrivial. There may exist people whose thoughts are so\nperfectly formed that they just flow straight into words. But I've\nnever known anyone who could do this, and if I met someone who said\nthey could, it would seem evidence of their limitations rather than\ntheir ability. Indeed, this is a trope in movies: the guy who claims\nto have a plan for doing some difficult thing, and who when questioned\nfurther, taps his head and says \"It's all up here.\" Everyone watching\nthe movie knows what that means. At best the plan is vague and\nincomplete. Very likely there's some undiscovered flaw that invalidates\nit completely. At best it's a plan for a plan.<br/><br/>In precisely defined domains it's possible to form complete ideas\nin your head. People can play chess in their heads, for example.\nAnd mathematicians can do some amount of math in their heads, though\nthey don't seem to feel sure of a proof over a certain length till\nthey write it down. But this only seems possible with ideas you can\nexpress in a formal language.  <font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"#f1n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">1</font></a>]</font> Arguably what such people are\ndoing is putting ideas into words in their heads. I can to some\nextent write essays in my head. I'll sometimes think of a paragraph\nwhile walking or lying in bed that survives nearly unchanged in the\nfinal version. But really I'm writing when I do this. I'm doing the\nmental part of writing; my fingers just aren't moving as I do it.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"#f2n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>You can know a great deal about something without writing about it.\nCan you ever know so much that you wouldn't learn more from trying\nto explain what you know? I don't think so. I've written about at\nleast two subjects I know well — Lisp hacking and startups\n— and in both cases I learned a lot from writing about them.\nIn both cases there were things I didn't consciously realize till\nI had to explain them. And I don't think my experience was anomalous.\nA great deal of knowledge is unconscious, and experts have if\nanything a higher proportion of unconscious knowledge than beginners.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that writing is the best way to explore all ideas.\nIf you have ideas about architecture, presumably the best way to\nexplore them is to build actual buildings. What I'm saying is that\nhowever much you learn from exploring ideas in other ways, you'll\nstill learn new things from writing about them.<br/><br/>Putting ideas into words doesn't have to mean writing, of course.\nYou can also do it the old way, by talking. But in my experience,\nwriting is the stricter test. You have to commit to a single, optimal\nsequence of words. Less can go unsaid when you don't have tone of\nvoice to carry meaning. And you can focus in a way that would seem\nexcessive in conversation. I'll often spend 2 weeks on an essay and\nreread drafts 50 times. If you did that in conversation\nit would seem evidence of some kind of\nmental disorder. \nIf you're lazy,\nof course, writing and talking are equally useless. But if you want\nto push yourself to get things right, writing is the steeper hill.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"#f3n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">3</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The reason I've spent so long establishing this rather obvious point\nis that it leads to another that many people will find shocking.\nIf writing down your ideas always makes them more precise and more\ncomplete, then no one who hasn't written about a topic has fully\nformed ideas about it. And someone who never writes has no fully\nformed ideas about anything nontrivial.<br/><br/>It feels to them as if they do, especially if they're not in the\nhabit of critically examining their own thinking. Ideas can feel\ncomplete. It's only when you try to put them into words that you\ndiscover they're not. So if you never subject your ideas to that\ntest, you'll not only never have fully formed ideas, but also never\nrealize it.<br/><br/>Putting ideas into words is certainly no guarantee that they'll be\nright. Far from it. But though it's not a sufficient condition, it\nis a necessary one.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>] Machinery and\ncircuits are formal languages.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>] I thought of this\nsentence as I was walking down the street in Palo Alto.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>] There are two\nsenses of talking to someone: a strict sense in which the conversation\nis verbal, and a more general sense in which it can take any form,\nincluding writing. In the limit case (e.g. Seneca's letters),\nconversation in the latter sense becomes essay writing.<br/><br/>It can be very useful to talk (in either sense) with other people\nas you're writing something. But a verbal conversation will never\nbe more exacting than when you're talking about something you're\nwriting.<br/><br/><br/><br/><font color=\"888888\"> <b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Patrick\nCollison, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.  </font><br/><br/></font>","date":"2022-02-01T00:00:00Z"}
