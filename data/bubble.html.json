{"href":"bubble.html","title":"What the Bubble Got Right","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">September 2004<br/><br/><i>(This essay is derived from an invited talk at ICFP 2004.)</i><br/><br/>I had a front row seat for the Internet Bubble,\nbecause I worked at Yahoo during 1998 and 1999.  One day,\nwhen the stock was trading around $200, I sat down and calculated\nwhat I thought the price should be. The \nanswer I got was $12.  I went to\nthe next cubicle and told my friend Trevor.  \"Twelve!\" he said.\nHe tried to sound indignant, but he didn't quite manage it.  He\nknew as well as I did that our valuation was crazy.<br/><br/>Yahoo was a special case.  It was not just our price to earnings\nratio that was bogus.  Half our earnings were too.  Not in\nthe Enron way, of course.  The finance guys seemed\nscrupulous about reporting earnings.  What made our\nearnings bogus was that Yahoo was, in effect, the center of\na Ponzi scheme.  Investors looked at Yahoo's earnings\nand said to themselves, here is proof that Internet companies can make\nmoney.  So they invested in new\nstartups that promised to be the next Yahoo.  And as soon as these startups\ngot the money, what did they do with it?\nBuy millions of dollars worth of advertising on Yahoo to promote\ntheir brand.  Result: a capital investment in a startup this\nquarter shows up as Yahoo earnings next quarter—stimulating\nanother round of investments in startups.<br/><br/>As in a Ponzi scheme, what seemed to be the returns of this system\nwere simply the latest round of investments in it.\nWhat made it not a Ponzi scheme was that it was unintentional.  \nAt least, I think it was.  The venture capital business is pretty incestuous,\nand there were presumably people in a position, if not to create\nthis situation, to realize what was happening and to milk it.<br/><br/>A year later the game was up.  Starting in January 2000, Yahoo's\nstock price began to crash, ultimately losing 95% of its\nvalue.<br/><br/>Notice, though, that even with all the fat trimmed off its market\ncap, Yahoo was still worth a lot.  Even at the morning-after\nvaluations of March and April 2001, the people at Yahoo had managed\nto create a company worth about $8 billion in just six years.<br/><br/>The fact is, despite all the nonsense we heard\nduring the Bubble about the \"new economy,\" there was a\ncore of truth.  You need\nthat to get a really big bubble: you need to have something\nsolid at the center, so that even smart people are sucked in.\n(Isaac Newton and Jonathan Swift both lost money\nin the South Sea Bubble of 1720.)<br/><br/>Now the pendulum has swung the other way.  Now anything that\nbecame fashionable during the Bubble is ipso facto unfashionable.\nBut that's a mistake—an even bigger mistake than believing\nwhat everyone was saying in 1999.  Over the long term,\nwhat the Bubble got right will be more important than what\nit got wrong.<br/><br/><b>1. Retail VC</b><br/><br/>After the excesses of the Bubble, it's now\nconsidered dubious to take companies public before they have earnings.\nBut there is nothing intrinsically wrong with\nthat idea.  Taking a company public at an early stage is simply\nretail VC: instead of going to venture capital firms for the last round of\nfunding, you go to the public markets.<br/><br/>By the end of the Bubble, companies going public with no\nearnings were being derided as \"concept stocks,\" as if it\nwere inherently stupid to invest in them.\nBut investing in concepts isn't stupid; it's what VCs do,\nand the best of them are far from stupid.<br/><br/>The stock of a company that doesn't yet have earnings is  \nworth <i>something.</i>\nIt may take a while for the market to learn\nhow to value such companies, just as it had to learn to\nvalue common stocks in the early 20th century.   But markets\nare good at solving that kind of problem.  I wouldn't be\nsurprised if the market ultimately did a better\njob than VCs do now.<br/><br/>Going public early will not be the right plan\nfor every company.\nAnd it can of course be\ndisruptive—by distracting the management, or by making the early\nemployees suddenly rich.  But just as the market will learn\nhow to value startups, startups will learn how to minimize\nthe damage of going public.<br/><br/><b>2. The Internet</b><br/><br/>The Internet genuinely is a big deal.  That was one reason\neven smart people were fooled by the Bubble.  Obviously \nit was going to have a huge effect.  Enough of an effect to\ntriple the value of Nasdaq companies in two years?  No, as it\nturned out.  But it was hard to say for certain at the time. [1]<br/><br/>The same thing happened during the Mississippi and South Sea Bubbles.\nWhat drove them was the invention of organized public finance\n(the South Sea Company, despite its name, was really a competitor\nof the Bank of England).  And that did turn out to be\na big deal, in the long run.<br/><br/>Recognizing an important trend turns out to be easier than \nfiguring out how to profit from it.  The mistake\ninvestors always seem to make is to take the trend too literally.\nSince the Internet was the big new thing, investors supposed\nthat the more Internettish the company, the better.  Hence\nsuch parodies as Pets.Com.<br/><br/>In fact most of the money to be made from big trends is made\nindirectly.  It was not the railroads themselves that \nmade the most money during the railroad boom, but the companies\non either side, like Carnegie's steelworks, which made the rails,\nand Standard Oil, which used railroads to get oil to the East Coast,\nwhere it could be shipped to Europe.<br/><br/>I think the Internet will have great effects,\nand that what we've seen so far is nothing compared to what's\ncoming.  But most of the winners will only indirectly be\nInternet companies; for every Google there will be ten\nJetBlues.<br/><br/><b>3. Choices</b><br/><br/>Why will the Internet have great effects?  The general   \nargument is that new forms of communication always do.  They happen\nrarely (till industrial times there were just speech, writing, and printing),\nbut when they do, they always cause a big splash.<br/><br/>The specific argument, or one of them, is the Internet gives us  \nmore choices.  In the \"old\" economy,\nthe high cost of presenting information to people meant they\nhad only a narrow range of options to choose from.  The tiny,\nexpensive pipeline to consumers was tellingly named \"the channel.\"\nControl the channel and you\ncould feed them what you wanted, on your terms.  And it\nwas not just big corporations that depended\non this principle.  So, in their way, did\nlabor unions, the traditional news media,\nand the art and literary establishments.\nWinning depended not on doing good work, but on gaining control\nof some bottleneck.<br/><br/>There are signs that this is changing.\nGoogle has over 82 million unique users a month and\nannual revenues of about three billion dollars. [2]\nAnd yet have you ever seen\na Google ad?\nSomething is going on here.<br/><br/>Admittedly, Google is an extreme case.  It's very easy for\npeople to switch to a new search engine.  It costs little\neffort and no money to try a new one, and it's easy to\nsee if the results are better.  And so Google doesn't <i>have</i>\nto advertise.  In a business like theirs, being the best is\nenough.<br/><br/>The exciting thing about the Internet is that it's\nshifting everything in that direction.\nThe hard part, if you want to win by making the best stuff,\nis the beginning.  Eventually everyone\nwill learn by word of mouth that you're the best,\nbut how do you survive to that point?  And it is in this crucial\nstage that the Internet has the most effect.  First, the\nInternet lets anyone find you at almost zero cost.\nSecond, it dramatically speeds up the rate at which\nreputation spreads by word of mouth.  Together these mean that in many\nfields the rule will be: Build it, and they will come.\nMake something great and put it online.\nThat is a big change from the recipe for winning in the\npast century.<br/><br/><b>4. Youth</b><br/><br/>The aspect of the Internet Bubble that the press seemed most\ntaken with was the youth of some of the startup founders.\nThis too is a trend that will last.\nThere is a huge standard deviation among 26 year olds.  Some\nare fit only for entry level jobs, but others are\nready to rule the world if they can find someone to handle\nthe paperwork for them.<br/><br/>A 26 year old may not be very good at managing people or\ndealing with the SEC.  Those require experience.\nBut those are also commodities, which can be handed off to\nsome lieutenant.  The most important quality in a CEO is his\nvision for the company's future.  What will they build next?\nAnd in that department, there are 26 year olds who can\ncompete with anyone.<br/><br/>In 1970 a company president meant someone in his fifties, at\nleast.   If he had technologists working for him, they were \ntreated like a racing stable: prized, but not powerful.  But \nas technology has grown more important, the power of nerds\nhas grown to reflect it.  Now it's not enough for a CEO to\nhave someone smart he can ask about technical matters.   Increasingly,\nhe has to be that person himself.<br/><br/>As always, business has clung to old forms.  VCs still seem\nto want to install a legitimate-looking \ntalking head as the CEO.  But increasingly the founders of\nthe company are the real powers, and the grey-headed man\ninstalled by the VCs more like a\nmusic group's manager than a general.<br/><br/><b>5. Informality</b><br/><br/>In New York, the Bubble had dramatic consequences:\nsuits went out of fashion.  They made one seem old.  So in\n1998 powerful New York types were suddenly wearing\nopen-necked shirts and khakis and oval wire-rimmed glasses,\njust like guys in Santa Clara.<br/><br/>The pendulum has swung back a bit, driven in part by a panicked\nreaction by the clothing industry.  But I'm betting on the\nopen-necked shirts.  And this is not as frivolous a question\nas it might seem.  Clothes are important, as all nerds can sense,\nthough they may not realize it consciously.<br/><br/>If you're a nerd, you can understand how important clothes are\nby asking yourself how you'd feel about a company\nthat made you wear a suit and tie to work.  The idea sounds\nhorrible, doesn't it?  In fact, horrible far out of proportion\nto the mere discomfort of wearing such clothes.  A company that\nmade programmers wear suits would have something deeply wrong\nwith it.<br/><br/>And what would be wrong would be that how one presented oneself\ncounted more than the quality of one's ideas.  <i>That's</i>\nthe problem with formality.  Dressing up is not so much bad in\nitself.  The problem is the receptor it binds to: dressing\nup is inevitably a substitute\nfor good ideas.   It is no coincidence that technically\ninept business types are known as \"suits.\"<br/><br/>Nerds don't just happen to dress informally.  They do it too\nconsistently.  Consciously or not, they dress informally as\na prophylactic measure against stupidity.<br/><br/><b>6. Nerds</b><br/><br/>Clothing is only the most visible battleground in the war\nagainst formality.  Nerds tend to eschew formality of any sort.\nThey're not impressed by one's job title, for example,\nor any of the other appurtenances of authority.<br/><br/>Indeed, that's practically the definition of a nerd.  I found\nmyself talking recently to someone from Hollywood who was planning\na show about nerds.  I thought it would be useful if I\nexplained what a nerd was.  What I came up with was: someone who\ndoesn't expend any effort on marketing himself.<br/><br/>A nerd, in other words, is someone who concentrates on substance.\nSo what's the connection between nerds and technology? Roughly\nthat you can't fool mother nature. In technical matters, you\nhave to get the right answers.  If your software miscalculates\nthe path of a space probe, you can't finesse your way out of\ntrouble by saying that your code is patriotic, or avant-garde,\nor any of the other dodges people use in nontechnical\nfields.<br/><br/>And as technology becomes increasingly important in the\neconomy, nerd culture is \n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/nerdad.html\">rising</a> with it.  Nerds are already\na lot cooler than they were when I was a kid.  When I was in\ncollege in the mid-1980s, \"nerd\" was still an insult.  People\nwho majored in computer science generally tried to conceal it.\nNow women ask me where they can meet nerds.  (The answer that\nsprings to mind is \"Usenix,\" but that would be like drinking\nfrom a firehose.)<br/><br/>I have no illusions about why nerd culture is becoming\nmore accepted.  It's not because people are\nrealizing that substance is more important than marketing.\nIt's because the nerds are getting \nrich.  But that is not going\nto change.<br/><br/><b>7. Options</b><br/><br/>What makes the nerds rich, usually, is stock options.  Now there\nare moves afoot to make it harder for companies to grant   \noptions.  To the extent there's some genuine accounting abuse \ngoing on, by all means correct it.  But don't kill the golden  \ngoose.  Equity is the fuel that drives technical innovation.<br/><br/>Options are a good idea because (a) they're fair, and (b) they\nwork.  Someone who goes to work for a company is (one hopes)   \nadding to its value, and it's only fair to give them a share\nof it.  And as a purely practical measure, people work a <i>lot</i>\nharder when they have options.  I've seen that first hand.<br/><br/>The fact that a few crooks during the Bubble robbed their\ncompanies by granting themselves options doesn't mean options\nare a bad idea.  During the railroad boom, some executives\nenriched themselves by selling watered stock—by issuing more\nshares than they said were outstanding.  But that doesn't  \nmake common stock a bad idea.  Crooks just use whatever\nmeans are available.<br/><br/>If there is a problem with options, it's that they reward\nslightly the wrong thing.  Not surprisingly, people do what you\npay them to. If you pay them by the hour, they'll work a lot of\nhours.  If you pay them by the volume of work done, they'll\nget a lot of work done (but only as you defined work).\nAnd if you pay them to raise the\nstock price, which is what options amount to, they'll raise\nthe stock price.<br/><br/>But that's not quite what you want.  What you want is to\nincrease the actual value of the company, not its market cap.\nOver time the two inevitably meet, but not always as quickly\nas options vest.  Which means options tempt employees, if\nonly unconsciously, to \"pump and dump\"—to do things\nthat will make the company <i>seem</i> valuable.\nI found that when I was at Yahoo, I couldn't help thinking,   \n\"how will this sound to investors?\"  when I should have been\nthinking \"is this a good idea?\"<br/><br/>So maybe the standard option deal needs to be tweaked slightly.\nMaybe options should be replaced with something tied more\ndirectly to earnings.  It's still early days.<br/><br/><b>8. Startups</b><br/><br/>What made the options valuable, for the most part, is\nthat they were options on the stock of \n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/start.html\">startups</a>.  Startups   \nwere not of course a creation of the Bubble, but they\nwere more visible during the Bubble than ever before.<br/><br/>One thing most people did learn about for the first time\nduring the Bubble was the startup\ncreated with the intention of selling it.\nOriginally a\nstartup meant a small company that hoped to grow into a\nbig one.  But increasingly startups are evolving into a\nvehicle for developing technology on spec.<br/><br/>As I wrote in\n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/hackpaint.html\">Hackers &amp; Painters</a>, employees seem to be most\nproductive when they're paid in proportion to the wealth\nthey generate.  And the advantage of a startup—indeed,   \nalmost its raison d'etre—is that it offers something\notherwise impossible to obtain: a way of <i>measuring</i> that.<br/><br/>In many businesses, it just makes more sense for companies\nto get technology by buying startups rather than developing   \nit in house.  You pay more, but there is less risk,\nand risk is what big companies don't want.  It makes the\nguys developing the technology more accountable, because they\nonly get paid if they build the winner.  And you end up   \nwith better technology, created faster, because things are\nmade in the innovative atmosphere of startups instead of \nthe bureaucratic atmosphere of big companies.<br/><br/>Our startup, Viaweb, was built to be sold.  We were open\nwith investors about that from the start.  And we were     \ncareful to create something that could slot easily into a\nlarger company.  That is the pattern for the future.<br/><br/><b>9. California</b><br/><br/>The Bubble was a California phenomenon.  When I showed up\nin Silicon Valley in 1998, I felt like an immigrant from\nEastern Europe arriving in America in 1900.  Everyone\nwas so cheerful and healthy and rich.  It seemed a new\nand improved world.<br/><br/>The press, ever eager to exaggerate small trends, now gives  \none the impression that Silicon Valley is a ghost town.\nNot at all.  When I drive down 101 from the airport,\nI still feel a buzz of energy, as if there were a giant\ntransformer nearby.  Real estate is still more expensive\nthan just about anywhere else in the country.  The people     \nstill look healthy, and the weather is still fabulous.\nThe future is there.\n(I say \"there\" because I moved back to the East Coast after\nYahoo.  I still wonder if this was a smart idea.)<br/><br/>What makes the Bay Area superior is the attitude of the\npeople.  I notice that when I come home to Boston.\nThe first thing I see when I walk out of the airline terminal\nis the fat, grumpy guy in\ncharge of the taxi line.  I brace myself for rudeness:\n<i>remember, you're back on the East Coast now.</i><br/><br/>The atmosphere varies from city to city, and fragile\norganisms like startups are exceedingly sensitive to such variation.\nIf it hadn't already been hijacked as a new euphemism\nfor liberal, the word to describe the atmosphere in\nthe Bay Area would be \"progressive.\"  People there are trying\nto build the future.\nBoston has MIT and Harvard, but it also has a lot of\ntruculent, unionized employees like the police who\nrecently held the Democratic National Convention for   \n<a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/president/2004-04-30-boston-police-convention_x.htm\">ransom</a>, and a lot of people trying to be\n Thurston Howell.\nTwo sides of an obsolete coin.<br/><br/>Silicon Valley may not be the next Paris or London, but it\nis at least the next Chicago.  For the next fifty years,   \nthat's where new wealth will come from.<br/><br/><b>10. Productivity</b><br/><br/>During the Bubble, optimistic analysts used to justify high\nprice to earnings ratios by saying that technology was going \nto increase productivity dramatically.  They were wrong about\nthe specific companies, but not so wrong about the underlying\nprinciple.  I think one of the big trends we'll see in the\ncoming century is a huge increase in productivity.<br/><br/>Or more precisely, a huge increase in <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/gh.html\">variation</a> in\nproductivity.  Technology is a lever.  It doesn't add;     \nit multiplies.  If the present range of productivity is  \n0 to 100, introducing a multiple of 10 increases the range\nfrom 0 to 1000.<br/><br/>One upshot of which is that the companies of the future may\nbe surprisingly small.  I sometimes daydream about how big\nyou could grow a company (in revenues) without ever having\nmore than ten people.  What would happen if you outsourced\neverything except product development?  If you tried this experiment,\nI think you'd be surprised at how far you could get. \nAs Fred Brooks pointed out, small groups are\nintrinsically more productive, because the\ninternal friction in a group grows as the\nsquare of its size.<br/><br/>Till quite recently, running a major company\nmeant managing an army of workers.  Our standards about how\nmany employees a company should have are still influenced by\nold patterns.  Startups are perforce small, because they can't\nafford to hire a lot of people.  But I think it's a big mistake for\ncompanies to loosen their belts as revenues increase.  The\nquestion is not whether you can afford the extra salaries.   \nCan you afford the loss in productivity that comes from making\nthe company bigger?<br/><br/>The prospect of technological leverage will of course raise the\nspecter of unemployment.  I'm surprised people still worry about\nthis.\nAfter centuries of supposedly job-killing innovations,\nthe number of jobs is within ten percent of the number of people\nwho want them.  This can't be a coincidence.  There must be some\nkind of balancing mechanism.<br/><br/><b>What's New</b><br/><br/>When one looks over these trends, is there any overall theme?\nThere does seem to be: that in the coming century, good ideas\nwill count for more.  That 26\nyear olds with good ideas will increasingly have an edge over 50\nyear olds with powerful connections.  That doing good work will\nmatter more than dressing up—or advertising, which is the\nsame thing for companies.  That people\nwill be rewarded a bit more in proportion to the value of what\nthey create.<br/><br/>If so, this is good news indeed.\nGood ideas always tend to win eventually.  The problem is,\nit can take a very long time.\nIt took decades for relativity to be accepted, and the\ngreater part of a century to establish that central planning didn't work.\nSo even a small increase in the\nrate at which good ideas win would be a momentous\nchange—big enough, probably, to justify a name like\nthe \"new economy.\"<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[1] Actually it's hard to say now.  As Jeremy Siegel points\nout, if the value of a stock is its future earnings, you \ncan't tell if it was overvalued till you see what the earnings\nturn out to be.   While certain famous Internet stocks were\nalmost certainly overvalued in 1999, it is still hard to say for sure\nwhether, e.g., the Nasdaq index was.<br/><br/>Siegel, Jeremy J.  \"What Is an Asset Price Bubble?
