{"href":"safe.html","title":"Why It's Safe for Founders to Be Nice","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">August 2015<br/><br/>I recently got an email from a founder that helped me understand\nsomething important: why it's safe for startup founders to be nice\npeople.<br/><br/>I grew up with a cartoon idea of a very successful businessman (in\nthe cartoon it was always a man): a rapacious, cigar-smoking,\ntable-thumping guy in his fifties who wins by exercising power, and\nisn't too fussy about how.  As I've written before, one of\nthe things that has surprised me most about startups is \n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/mean.html\">how few</a> of\nthe most successful founders are like that.  Maybe successful people\nin other industries are; I don't know; but not startup founders.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/safe.html#f1n\"><font color=\"#999999\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>I knew this empirically, but I never saw the math of why till I got\nthis founder's email.  In it he said he worried that he was\nfundamentally soft-hearted and tended to give away too much for\nfree. He thought perhaps he needed \"a little dose of sociopath-ness.\"<br/><br/>I told him not to worry about it, because so long as he built\nsomething good enough to spread by word of mouth, he'd have a\nsuperlinear growth curve.  If he was bad at extracting money from\npeople, at worst this curve would be some constant multiple less\nthan 1 of what it might have been.  But a constant multiple of any\ncurve is exactly the same shape.  The numbers on the Y axis are\nsmaller, but the curve is just as steep, and when anything grows\nat the rate of a successful startup, the Y axis will take care of\nitself.<br/><br/>Some examples will make this clear.  Suppose your company is making\n$1000 a month now, and you've made something so great that it's\ngrowing at 5% a week.  Two years from now, you'll be making about\n$160k a month.<br/><br/>Now suppose you're so un-rapacious that you only extract half as\nmuch from your users as you could.  That means two years later\nyou'll be making $80k a month instead of $160k.  How far behind are\nyou? How long will it take to catch up with where you'd have been\nif you were extracting every penny?  A mere 15 weeks.  After two\nyears, the un-rapacious founder is only 3.5 months behind the\nrapacious one. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/safe.html#f2n\"><font color=\"#999999\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>If you're going to optimize a number, the one to choose is your\n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/growth.html\">growth rate</a>. Suppose as before that you only extract half as much\nfrom users as you could, but that you're able to grow 6% a week\ninstead of 5%.  Now how are you doing compared to the rapacious\nfounder after two years?  You're already ahead—$214k a month\nversus $160k—and pulling away fast.  In another year you'll be\nmaking $4.4 million a month to the rapacious founder's $2 million.<br/><br/>Obviously one case where it would help to be rapacious is when\ngrowth depends on that.  What makes startups different is that\nusually it doesn't. Startups usually win by making something so\ngreat that people recommend it to their friends.  And being rapacious\nnot only doesn't help you do that, but probably hurts.  \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/safe.html#f3n\"><font color=\"#999999\">3</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The reason startup founders can safely be nice is that making great\nthings is compounded, and rapacity isn't.<br/><br/>So if you're a founder, here's a deal you can make with yourself\nthat will both make you happy and make your company successful.\nTell yourself you can be as nice as you want, so long as you work\nhard on your growth rate to compensate.  Most successful startups\nmake that tradeoff unconsciously. Maybe if you do it consciously\nyou'll do it even better.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nMany think successful startup founders are driven by money.\nIn fact the secret weapon of the most successful founders is that\nthey aren't.  If they were, they'd have taken one of the acquisition\noffers that every fast-growing startup gets on the way up.  What\ndrives the most successful founders is the same thing that drives\nmost people who make things: the company is their project.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nIn fact since 2 ≈ 1.05 ^ 15, the un-rapacious founder is\nalways 15 weeks behind the rapacious one.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nThe other reason it might help to be good at squeezing money\nout of customers is that startups usually lose money at first, and\nmaking more per customer makes it easier to get to profitability\nbefore your initial funding runs out.  But while it is very common\nfor startups to <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/pinch.html\">die</a>\nfrom running through their initial funding and then being unable\nto raise more, the underlying cause is usually slow growth or\nexcessive spending rather than insufficient effort to extract money\nfrom existing customers.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Harj Taggar, Jessica Livingston, and\nGeoff Ralston for reading drafts of this, and to Randall Bennett\nfor being such a nice guy.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2015-08-01T00:00:00Z"}
