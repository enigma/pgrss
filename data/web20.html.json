Till recently I thought it didn't,\nbut the truth turns out to be more complicated.  Originally, yes,\nit was meaningless.  Now it seems to have acquired a meaning.  And\nyet those who dislike the term are probably right, because if it\nmeans what I think it does, we don't need it.<br/><br/>I first heard the phrase \"Web 2.0\" in the name of the Web 2.0\nconference in 2004.  At the time it was supposed to mean using \"the\nweb as a platform,\" which I took to refer to web-based applications.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/web20.html#f1n\"><font color=\"#777777\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>So I was surprised at a conference this summer when Tim O'Reilly\nled a session intended to figure out a definition of \"Web 2.0.\"\nDidn't it already mean using the web as a platform?  And if it\ndidn't already mean something, why did we need the phrase at all?<br/><br/><b>Origins</b><br/><br/>Tim says the phrase \"Web 2.0\" first\n<a href=\"http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20\n.html\">arose</a> in \"a brainstorming session between\nO'Reilly and Medialive International.\" What is Medialive International?\n\"Producers of technology tradeshows and conferences,\" according to\ntheir site.  So presumably that's what this brainstorming session\nwas about.  O'Reilly wanted to organize a conference about the web,\nand they were wondering what to call it.<br/><br/>I don't think there was any deliberate plan to suggest there was a\nnew <i>version</i> of the web.  They just wanted to make the point\nthat the web mattered again.  It was a kind of semantic deficit\nspending: they knew new things were coming, and the \"2.0\" referred\nto whatever those might turn out to be.<br/><br/>And they were right.  New things were coming.  But the new version\nnumber led to some awkwardness in the short term.  In the process\nof developing the pitch for the first conference, someone must have\ndecided they'd better take a stab at explaining what that \"2.0\"\nreferred to.  Whatever it meant, \"the web as a platform\" was at\nleast not too constricting.<br/><br/>The story about \"Web 2.0\" meaning the web as a platform didn't live\nmuch past the first conference.  By the second conference, what\n\"Web 2.0\" seemed to mean was something about democracy.  At least,\nit did when people wrote about it online.  The conference itself\ndidn't seem very grassroots.  It cost $2800, so the only people who\ncould afford to go were VCs and people from big companies.<br/><br/>And yet, oddly enough, Ryan Singel's <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,69114,00.html\">article</a>\nabout the conference in <i>Wired News</i> spoke of \"throngs of\ngeeks.\"  When a friend of mine asked Ryan about this, it was news\nto him.  He said he'd originally written something like \"throngs\nof VCs and biz dev guys\" but had later shortened it just to \"throngs,\"\nand that this must have in turn been expanded by the editors into\n\"throngs of geeks.\"  After all, a Web 2.0 conference would presumably\nbe full of geeks, right?<br/><br/>Well, no.  There were about 7.  Even Tim O'Reilly was wearing a   \nsuit, a sight so alien I couldn't parse it at first.  I saw\nhim walk by and said to one of the O'Reilly people \"that guy looks\njust like Tim.\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, that's Tim.  He bought a suit.\"\nI ran after him, and sure enough, it was.  He explained that he'd\njust bought it in Thailand.<br/><br/>The 2005 Web 2.0 conference reminded me of Internet trade shows\nduring the Bubble, full of prowling VCs looking for the next hot\nstartup.  There was that same odd atmosphere created by a large  \nnumber of people determined not to miss out.  Miss out on what?\nThey didn't know.  Whatever was going to happen—whatever Web 2.0\nturned out to be.<br/><br/>I wouldn't quite call it \"Bubble 2.0\" just because VCs are eager\nto invest again.  The Internet is a genuinely big deal.  The bust\nwas as much an <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/bubble.html\">overreaction</a> as\nthe boom.  It's to be expected that once we started to pull out of\nthe bust, there would be a lot of growth in this area, just as there\nwas in the industries that spiked the sharpest before the Depression.<br/><br/>The reason this won't turn into a second Bubble is that the IPO\nmarket is gone.  <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/startupfunding.html\">Venture investors</a>\nare driven by exit strategies.  The reason they were funding all  \nthose laughable startups during the late 90s was that they hoped\nto sell them to gullible retail investors; they hoped to be laughing\nall the way to the bank.  Now that route is closed.  Now the default\nexit strategy is to get bought, and acquirers are less prone to\nirrational exuberance than IPO investors.  The closest you'll get \nto Bubble valuations is Rupert Murdoch paying $580 million for   \nMyspace.  That's only off by a factor of 10 or so.<br/><br/><b>1. Ajax</b><br/><br/>Does \"Web 2.0\" mean anything more than the name of a conference\nyet?  I don't like to admit it, but it's starting to.  When people\nsay \"Web 2.0\" now, I have some idea what they mean.  And the fact\nthat I both despise the phrase and understand it is the surest proof\nthat it has started to mean something.<br/><br/>One ingredient of its meaning is certainly Ajax, which I can still\nonly just bear to use without scare quotes.  Basically, what \"Ajax\"\nmeans is \"Javascript now works.\"  And that in turn means that\nweb-based applications can now be made to work much more like desktop\nones.<br/><br/>As you read this, a whole new <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB113098635587487074.html?mod=todays_\nfree_feature\">generation</a>\nof software is being written to take advantage of Ajax.  There\nhasn't been such a wave of new applications since microcomputers\nfirst appeared.  Even Microsoft sees it, but it's too late for them\nto do anything more than <a href=\"http://www.hypercamp.org/2005/11/09\">leak</a> \"internal\"  \ndocuments designed to give the impression they're on top of this\nnew trend.<br/><br/>In fact the new generation of software is being written way too\nfast for Microsoft even to channel it, let alone write their own\nin house.  Their only hope now is to buy all the best Ajax startups\nbefore Google does.  And even that's going to be hard, because\nGoogle has as big a head start in buying microstartups as it did\nin search a few years ago.  After all, Google Maps, the canonical\nAjax application, was the result of a startup they <a href=\"http://googlemapsmania.blogspot.com/2005/10/google-maps-lead-engineer-gaze\ns-into.html\">bought</a>.<br/><br/>So ironically the original description of the Web 2.0 conference\nturned out to be partially right: web-based applications are a big\ncomponent of Web 2.0.  But I'm convinced they got this right by \naccident.  The Ajax boom didn't start till early 2005, when Google\nMaps appeared and the term \"Ajax\" was <a href=\"http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php\">coined</a>.<br/><br/><b>2. Democracy</b><br/><br/>The second big element of Web 2.0 is democracy.  We now have several\nexamples to prove that <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/opensource.html\">amateurs</a> can   \nsurpass professionals, when they have the right kind of system to \nchannel their efforts.  <a href=\"http://wikipedia.org\">Wikipedia</a>\nmay be the most famous.  Experts have given Wikipedia middling\nreviews, but they miss the critical point: it's good enough.  And   \nit's free, which means people actually read it.  On the web, articles\nyou have to pay for might as well not exist.  Even if you were    \nwilling to pay to read them yourself, you can't link to them.    \nThey're not part of the conversation.<br/><br/>Another place democracy seems to win is in deciding what counts as\nnews.  I never look at any news site now except <a href=\"http://reddit.com\">Reddit</a>.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/web20.html#f2n\"><font color=\"#777777\">2</font></a>]</font>\n I know if something major\nhappens, or someone writes a particularly interesting article, it   \nwill show up there.  Why bother checking the front page of any\nspecific paper or magazine?  Reddit's like an RSS feed for the whole\nweb, with a filter for quality.  Similar sites include <a href=\"http://digg.com\">Digg</a>, a technology news site that's\nrapidly approaching Slashdot in popularity, and <a href=\"http://del.icio.us\">del.icio.us</a>, the collaborative\nbookmarking network that set off the \"tagging\" movement.  And whereas\nWikipedia's main appeal is that it's good enough and free, these\nsites suggest that voters do a significantly better job than human\neditors.<br/><br/>The most dramatic example of Web 2.0 democracy is not in the selection\nof ideas, but their production.  <!-- Usage has not yet evolved to reflect\nthis: the only phrases we have to describe the phenomenon are ones \nthat implicitly assume the superiority of the old order, like\n\"user-generated content,\" or \"blogging\" (neutral in itself, but \nrevealingly condescending in its over-broad use).\n-->\nI've noticed for a while that the stuff I read on individual people's\nsites is as good as or better than the stuff I read in newspapers\nand magazines.  And now I have independent evidence: the top links\non Reddit are generally links to individual people's sites rather  \nthan to magazine articles or news stories.<br/><br/>My experience of writing\nfor magazines suggests an explanation.  Editors.  They control the\ntopics you can write about, and they can generally rewrite whatever\nyou produce.  The result is to damp extremes.  Editing yields 95th\npercentile writing—95% of articles are improved by it, but 5% are\ndragged down.  5% of the time you get \"throngs of geeks.\"<br/><br/>On the web, people can publish whatever they want.  Nearly all of\nit falls short of the editor-damped writing in print publications.\nBut the pool of writers is very, very large.  If it's large enough,\nthe lack of damping means the best writing online should surpass  \nthe best in print.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/web20.html#f3n\"><font color=\"#777777\">3</font></a>]</font>  \nAnd now that the web has evolved mechanisms\nfor selecting good stuff, the web wins net.  Selection beats damping,\nfor the same reason market economies beat centrally planned ones.<br/><br/>Even the startups are different this time around.  They are to the  \nstartups of the Bubble what bloggers are to the print media.  During\nthe Bubble, a startup meant a company headed by an MBA that was   \nblowing through several million dollars of VC money to \"get big\nfast\" in the most literal sense.  Now it means a smaller, <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/hiring.html\">younger</a>, more technical group that just      \ndecided to make something great.  They'll decide later if they want  \nto raise VC-scale funding, and if they take it, they'll take it on\n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/vcsqueeze.html\">their terms</a>.<br/><br/><b>3. Don't Maltreat Users</b><br/><br/>I think everyone would agree that democracy and Ajax are elements\nof \"Web 2.0.\"  I also see a third: not to maltreat users.  During\nthe Bubble a lot of popular sites were quite high-handed with users.\nAnd not just in obvious ways, like making them register, or subjecting\nthem to annoying ads.  The very design of the average site in the   \nlate 90s was an abuse.  Many of the most popular sites were loaded\nwith obtrusive branding that made them slow to load and sent the\nuser the message: this is our site, not yours.  (There's a physical\nanalog in the Intel and Microsoft <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/designedforwindows.html\">stickers</a> that come on some\nlaptops.)<br/><br/>I think the root of the problem was that sites felt they were giving\nsomething away for free, and till recently a company giving anything\naway for free could be pretty high-handed about it.  Sometimes it\nreached the point of economic sadism: site owners assumed that the\nmore pain they caused the user, the more benefit it must be to them.  \nThe most dramatic remnant of this model may be at salon.com, where   \nyou can read the beginning of a story, but to get the rest you have\nsit through a <i>movie</i>.<br/><br/>At Y Combinator we advise all the startups we fund never to lord\nit over users.  Never make users register, unless you need to in\norder to store something for them.  If you do make users register,   \nnever make them wait for a confirmation link in an email; in fact,\ndon't even ask for their email address unless you need it for some\nreason.  Don't ask them any unnecessary questions.  Never send them\nemail unless they explicitly ask for it.  Never frame pages you\nlink to, or open them in new windows.  If you have a free version \nand a pay version, don't make the free version too restricted.  And\nif you find yourself asking \"should we allow users to do x?\" just \nanswer \"yes\" whenever you're unsure.  Err on the side of generosity.<br/><br/>In <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/start.html\">How to Start a Startup</a> I advised startups\nnever to let anyone fly under them, meaning never to let any other\ncompany offer a cheaper, easier solution.  Another way to fly low \nis to give users more power.  Let users do what they want.  If you \ndon't and a competitor does, you're in trouble.<br/><br/>iTunes is Web 2.0ish in this sense.  Finally you can buy individual\nsongs instead of having to buy whole albums.  The recording industry\nhated the idea and resisted it as long as possible.  But it was\nobvious what users wanted, so Apple flew under the labels.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/web20.html#f4n\"><font color=\"#777777\">4</font></a>]</font>\nThough really it might be better to describe iTunes as Web 1.5.     \nWeb 2.0 applied to music would probably mean individual bands giving\naway DRMless songs for free.<br/><br/>The ultimate way to be nice to users is to give them something for\nfree that competitors charge for.  During the 90s a lot of people   \nprobably thought we'd have some working system for micropayments     \nby now.  In fact things have gone in the other direction.  The most   \nsuccessful sites are the ones that figure out new ways to give stuff\naway for free.  Craigslist has largely destroyed the classified ad\nsites of the 90s, and OkCupid looks likely to do the same to the\nprevious generation of dating sites.<br/><br/>Serving web pages is very, very cheap.  If you can make even a   \nfraction of a cent per page view, you can make a profit.  And\ntechnology for targeting ads continues to improve.  I wouldn't be\nsurprised if ten years from now eBay had been supplanted by an      \nad-supported freeBay (or, more likely, gBay).<br/><br/>Odd as it might sound, we tell startups that they should try to\nmake as little money as possible.  If you can figure out a way to\nturn a billion dollar industry into a fifty million dollar industry,\nso much the better, if all fifty million go to you.  Though indeed,\nmaking things cheaper often turns out to generate more money in the\nend, just as automating things often turns out to generate more\njobs.<br/><br/>The ultimate target is Microsoft.  What a bang that balloon is going\nto make when someone pops it by offering a free web-based alternative \nto MS Office.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/web20.html#f5n\"><font color=\"#777777\">5</font></a>]</font>\nWho will?  Google?  They seem to be taking their\ntime.  I suspect the pin will be wielded by a couple of 20 year old\nhackers who are too naive to be intimidated by the idea.  (How hard\ncan it be?)<br/><br/><b>The Common Thread</b><br/><br/>Ajax, democracy, and not dissing users.  What do they all have in  \ncommon?  I didn't realize they had anything in common till recently,\nwhich is one of the reasons I disliked the term \"Web 2.0\" so much.\nIt seemed that it was being used as a label for whatever happened\nto be new—that it didn't predict anything.<br/><br/>But there is a common thread.  Web 2.0 means using the web the way\nit's meant to be used.  The \"trends\" we're seeing now are simply\nthe inherent nature of the web emerging from under the broken models\nthat got imposed on it during the Bubble.<br/><br/>I realized this when I read an <!-- as-yet unpublished--> interview with\nJoe Kraus, the co-founder of Excite.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/web20.html#f6n\"><font color=\"#777777\">6</font></a>]</font>\n<blockquote>\n  Excite really never got the business model right at all.  We fell \n  into the classic problem of how when a new medium comes out it\n  adopts the practices, the content, the business models of the old\n  medium—which fails, and then the more appropriate models get\n  figured out.\n</blockquote>\nIt may have seemed as if not much was happening during the years\nafter the Bubble burst.  But in retrospect, something was happening:\nthe web was finding its natural angle of repose.  The democracy \ncomponent, for example—that's not an innovation, in the sense of\nsomething someone made happen.  That's what the web naturally tends\nto produce.<br/><br/>Ditto for the idea of delivering desktop-like applications over the\nweb.  That idea is almost as old as the web.  But the first time    \naround it was co-opted by Sun, and we got Java applets.  Java has\nsince been remade into a generic replacement for C++, but in 1996\nthe story about Java was that it represented a new model of software.\nInstead of desktop applications, you'd run Java \"applets\" delivered\nfrom a server.<br/><br/>This plan collapsed under its own weight. Microsoft helped kill it,\nbut it would have died anyway.  There was no uptake among hackers.\nWhen you find <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/submarine.html\">PR firms</a> promoting\nsomething as the next development platform, you can be sure it's\nnot.  If it were, you wouldn't need PR firms to tell you, because   \nhackers would already be writing stuff on top of it, the way sites    \nlike <a href=\"http://busmonster.com\">Busmonster</a> used Google Maps as a\nplatform before Google even meant it to be one.<br/><br/>The proof that Ajax is the next hot platform is that thousands of  \nhackers have spontaneously started building things on top\nof it.  Mikey likes it.<br/><br/>There's another thing all three components of Web 2.0 have in common.\nHere's a clue.  Suppose you approached investors with the following\nidea for a Web 2.0 startup:\n<blockquote>\n  Sites like del.icio.us and flickr allow users to \"tag\" content\n  with descriptive tokens.  But there is also huge source of\n  <i>implicit</i> tags that they ignore: the text within web links.\n  Moreover, these links represent a social network connecting the   \n  individuals and organizations who created the pages, and by using\n  graph theory we can compute from this network an estimate of the\n  reputation of each member.  We plan to mine the web for these \n  implicit tags, and use them together with the reputation hierarchy\n  they embody to enhance web searches.\n</blockquote>\nHow long do you think it would take them on average to realize that\nit was a description of Google?<br/><br/>Google was a pioneer in all three components of Web 2.0: their core\nbusiness sounds crushingly hip when described in Web 2.0 terms, \n\"Don't maltreat users\" is a subset of \"Don't be evil,\" and of course\nGoogle set off the whole Ajax boom with Google Maps.<br/><br/>Web 2.0 means using the web as it was meant to be used, and Google\ndoes.  That's their secret.  <!-- The web naturally has a certain grain,\nand Google is aligned with it.  That's why their success seems so   \neffortless.-->  They're sailing with the wind, instead of sitting  \nbecalmed praying for a business model, like the print media, or   \ntrying to tack upwind by suing their customers, like Microsoft and \nthe record labels.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/web20.html#f7n\"><font color=\"#777777\">7</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Google doesn't try to force things to happen their way.  They try   \nto figure out what's going to happen, and arrange to be standing \nthere when it does.  That's the way to approach technology—and \nas business includes an ever larger technological component, the\nright way to do business.<br/><br/>The fact that Google is a \"Web 2.0\" company shows that, while\nmeaningful, the term is also rather bogus.  It's like the word\n\"allopathic.\"  It just means doing things right, and it's a bad   \nsign when you have a special word for that.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nFrom the <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20040602111547/http://web2con.com/\">conference\nsite</a>, June 2004: \"While the first wave of the Web was closely  \ntied to the browser, the second wave extends applications across    \nthe web and enables a new generation of services and business\nopportunities.\"  To the extent this means anything, it seems to be\nabout \n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/road.html\">web-based applications</a>.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nDisclosure: Reddit was funded by \n<a href=\"http://ycombinator.com\">Y Combinator</a>.
