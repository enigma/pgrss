{"href":"convergence.html","title":"Why TV Lost","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">March 2009<br/><br/>About twenty years ago people noticed computers and TV were on a\ncollision course and started to speculate about what they'd produce\nwhen they converged.  We now know the answer: computers.  It's clear\nnow that even by using the word \"convergence\" we were giving TV too\nmuch credit.  This won't be convergence so much as replacement.\nPeople may still watch things they call \"TV shows,\" but they'll\nwatch them mostly on computers.<br/><br/>What decided the contest for computers?  Four forces, three of which\none could have predicted, and one that would have been harder to.<br/><br/>One predictable cause of victory is that the Internet is an open\nplatform.  Anyone can build whatever they want on it, and the market\npicks the winners.  So innovation happens at hacker speeds instead\nof big company speeds.<br/><br/>The second is Moore's Law, which has worked its usual magic on\nInternet bandwidth. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f1n\"><font color=\"#999999\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The third reason computers won is piracy. Users prefer it \nnot just because it's free, but because it's\nmore convenient.  Bittorrent and YouTube have already trained a new\ngeneration of viewers that the place to watch shows is on a computer\nscreen.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f2n\"><font color=\"#999999\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The somewhat more surprising force was one specific type of innovation:\nsocial applications.  The average teenage kid has a pretty much\ninfinite capacity for talking to their friends.  But they can't\nphysically be with them all the time.  When I was in high school\nthe solution was the telephone.  Now it's social networks, multiplayer\ngames, and various messaging applications.  The way you reach them\nall is through a computer.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f3n\"><font color=\"#999999\">3</font></a>]</font>\nWhich means every teenage kid (a)\nwants a computer with an Internet connection, (b) has an incentive\nto figure out how to use it, and (c) spends countless hours in front\nof it.<br/><br/>This was the most powerful force of all.  This was what made everyone\nwant computers.  Nerds got computers because they liked them.  Then\ngamers got them to play games on.  But it was connecting to other\npeople that got everyone else: that's what made even grandmas and\n14 year old girls want computers.\n<!--\nComputers still aren't really ready for prime time.  I'm pretty\ncomfortable with technology, but I would be horrified at the prospect\nof having to deal with the virus-ridden Windows machine the average\nperson uses.  I can't believe they put up with it.  But they will\nto reach their friends.--><br/><br/>After decades of running an IV drip right into their audience,\npeople in the entertainment business had understandably come to\nthink of them as rather passive.  They thought they'd be able to\ndictate the way shows reached audiences.  But they underestimated\nthe force of their desire to connect with one another.<br/><br/>Facebook killed TV.  That is wildly oversimplified, of course, but\nprobably as close to the truth as you can get in three words.<br/><br/><center>___</center><br/><br/>The TV networks already seem, grudgingly, to see where things are\ngoing, and have responded by putting their stuff, grudgingly, online.\nBut they're still dragging their heels.  They still seem to wish\npeople would watch shows on TV instead, just as newspapers that put\ntheir stories online still seem to wish people would wait till the\nnext morning and read them printed on paper.  They should both just\nface the fact that the Internet is the primary medium.<br/><br/>They'd be in a better position if they'd done that earlier.  When\na new medium arises that's powerful enough to make incumbents\nnervous, then it's probably powerful enough to win, and the best\nthing they can do is jump in immediately.<br/><br/>Whether they like it or not, big changes are coming, because the\nInternet dissolves the two cornerstones of broadcast media:\nsynchronicity and locality.  On the Internet, you don't have to\nsend everyone the same signal, and you don't have to send it to\nthem from a local source.  People will watch what they want when\nthey want it, and group themselves according to whatever shared\ninterest they feel most strongly.  Maybe their strongest shared\ninterest will be their physical location, but I'm guessing not.\nWhich means local TV is probably dead.  It was an artifact of\nlimitations imposed by old technology.  If someone were creating\nan Internet-based TV company from scratch now, they might have some\nplan for shows aimed at specific regions, but it wouldn't be a top\npriority.<br/><br/>Synchronicity and locality are tied together.  TV network affiliates\ncare what's on at 10 because that delivers viewers for local news\nat 11.  This connection adds more brittleness than strength, however:\npeople don't watch what's on at 10 because they want to watch the\nnews afterward.<br/><br/>TV networks will fight these trends, because they don't have\nsufficient flexibility to adapt to them.  They're hemmed in by local\naffiliates in much the same way car companies are hemmed in by\ndealers and unions.  Inevitably, the people running the networks\nwill take the easy route and try to keep the old model running for\na couple more years, just as the record labels have done.<br/><br/>A recent article in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> described how TV networks\nwere trying to add more live shows, partly as a way to make viewers\nwatch TV synchronously instead of watching recorded shows when it\nsuited them.  Instead of delivering what viewers want, they're\ntrying to force them to change their habits to suit the networks'\nobsolete business model.  That never works unless you have a monopoly\nor cartel to enforce it, and even then it only works temporarily.<br/><br/>The other reason networks like live shows is that they're cheaper\nto produce.  There they have the right idea, but they haven't\nfollowed it to its conclusion.   Live content can be way cheaper\nthan networks realize, and the way to take advantage of dramatic\ndecreases in cost is to \n<a href=\"http://justin.tv\">increase volume</a>.  The networks are prevented\nfrom seeing this whole line of reasoning because they still think\nof themselves as being in the broadcast businessâ€”as sending one\nsignal to everyone.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f4n\"><font color=\"#999999\">4</font></a>]</font><br/><br/><center>___</center><br/><br/><a href=\"badeconomy.html\">Now</a> would be a good time to start any company that competes with\nTV networks.  That's what a lot of Internet startups are, though\nthey may not have had this as an explicit goal.  People only have\nso many leisure hours a day, and TV is premised on such long sessions\n(unlike Google, which prides itself on sending users on their way\nquickly) that anything that takes up their time is competing with\nit.  But in addition to such indirect competitors, I think TV\ncompanies will increasingly face direct ones.<br/><br/>Even in cable TV, the long tail was lopped off prematurely by the\nthreshold you had to get over to start a new channel.  It will be\nlonger on the Internet, and there will be more mobility within it.\nIn this new world, the existing players will only have the advantages\nany big company has in its market.<br/><br/>That will change the balance of power between the networks and the\npeople who produce shows.  The networks used to be gatekeepers.\nThey distributed your work, and sold advertising on it.  Now the\npeople who produce a show can distribute it themselves.  The main\nvalue networks supply now is ad sales.  Which will tend to put them\nin the position of service providers rather than publishers.<br/><br/>Shows will change even more.  On the Internet there's no reason to\nkeep their current format, or even the fact that they have a single\nformat.  Indeed, the more interesting sort of convergence that's\ncoming is between shows and games.  But on the question of what\nsort of entertainment gets distributed on the Internet in 20 years,\nI wouldn't dare to make any predictions, except that things will\nchange a lot.  We'll get whatever the most imaginative people can\ncook up.  That's why the Internet won.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nThanks to Trevor Blackwell for this point.  He adds: \"I\nremember the eyes of phone companies gleaming in the early 90s when\nthey talked about convergence.  They thought most programming would\nbe on demand, and they would implement it and make a lot of money.\nIt didn't work out. They assumed that their local network infrastructure\nwould be critical to do video on-demand, because you couldn't\npossibly stream it from a few data centers over the internet. At\nthe time (1992) the entire cross-country Internet bandwidth wasn't\nenough for one video stream. But wide-area bandwidth increased more\nthan they expected and they were beaten by iTunes and Hulu.\"<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nCopyright owners tend to focus on the aspect they see of\npiracy, which is the lost revenue.  They therefore think what drives\nusers to do it is the desire to get something for free.  But iTunes\nshows that people will pay for stuff online, if you make it easy.\nA significant component of piracy is simply that it offers a better\nuser experience.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nOr a phone that is actually a computer.  I'm not making any\npredictions about the size of the device that will replace TV, just\nthat it will have a browser and get data via the Internet.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f4n\"><font color=\"#000000\">4</font></a>]\nEmmett Shear writes: \"I'd argue the long tail for sports may\nbe even larger than the long tail for other kinds of content. Anyone\ncan broadcast a high school football game that will be interesting\nto 10,000 people or so, even if the quality of production is not\nso good.\"<br/><br/>\n<b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Nancy Cook, Michael Seibel,\nEmmett Shear, and Fred Wilson for reading drafts of this.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2009-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
