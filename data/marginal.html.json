As we stood there, he said that as a kid growing up in\nSaskatchewan he'd been amazed at the dedication Jobs and Wozniak\nmust have had to work in a garage.<br/><br/>\"Those guys must have been\nfreezing!\"<br/><br/>That's one of California's hidden advantages: the mild climate means\nthere's lots of marginal space.  In cold places that margin gets\ntrimmed off.  There's a sharper line between outside and inside,\nand only projects that are officially sanctioned — by organizations,\nor parents, or wives, or at least by oneself — get proper indoor\nspace.  That raises the activation energy for new ideas.  You can't\njust tinker. You have to justify.<br/><br/>Some of Silicon Valley's most famous companies began in garages:\nHewlett-Packard in 1938, Apple in 1976, Google in 1998.  In Apple's\ncase the garage story is a bit of an urban legend.  Woz says all\nthey did there was assemble some computers, and that he did all the\nactual design of the Apple I and Apple II in his apartment or his\ncube at HP.  \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f1n\"><font color=\"#777777\">1</font></a>]</font>\nThis was apparently too marginal even for Apple's PR\npeople.<br/><br/>By conventional standards, Jobs and Wozniak were marginal people\ntoo.  Obviously they were smart, but they can't have looked good\non paper.  They were at the time a pair of college dropouts with\nabout three years of school between them, and hippies to boot.\nTheir previous business experience consisted of making \"blue boxes\"\nto hack into the phone system, a business with the rare distinction\nof being both illegal and unprofitable.<br/><br/><b>Outsiders</b><br/><br/>Now a startup operating out of a garage in Silicon Valley would\nfeel part of an exalted tradition, like the poet in his garret, or\nthe painter who can't afford to heat his studio and thus has to\nwear a beret indoors.  But in 1976 it didn't seem so cool.  The\nworld hadn't yet realized that starting a computer company was in\nthe same category as being a writer or a painter. It hadn't been\nfor long.  Only in the preceding couple years had the dramatic fall\nin the cost of hardware allowed outsiders to compete.<br/><br/>In 1976, everyone looked down on a company operating out of a garage,\nincluding the founders.  One of the first things Jobs did when they\ngot some money was to rent office space.  He wanted Apple to seem\nlike a real company.<br/><br/>They already had something few real companies ever have: a fabulously well\ndesigned product.  You'd think they'd have had more confidence.\nBut I've talked to a lot of startup founders, and it's always this\nway.  They've built something that's going to change the world, and\nthey're worried about some nit like not having proper business\ncards.<br/><br/>That's the paradox I want to explore: great new things often come\nfrom the margins, and yet the people who discover them are looked\ndown on by everyone, including themselves.<br/><br/>It's an old idea that new things come from the margins. I want to\nexamine its internal structure.  Why do great ideas come from the\nmargins?  What kind of ideas?  And is there anything we can do to\nencourage the process?<br/><br/><b>Insiders</b><br/><br/>One reason so many good ideas come from the margin is simply that\nthere's so much of it. There have to be more outsiders than insiders,\nif insider means anything.  If the number of outsiders is huge it\nwill always seem as if a lot of ideas come from them, even if few\ndo per capita.  But I think there's more going on than this.  There\nare real disadvantages to being an insider, and in some kinds of\nwork they can outweigh the advantages.<br/><br/>Imagine, for example, what would happen if the government decided\nto commission someone to write an official Great American Novel.\nFirst there'd be a huge ideological squabble over who to choose.\nMost of the best writers would be excluded for having offended one\nside or the other.  Of the remainder, the smart ones would refuse\nsuch a job, leaving only a few with the wrong sort of ambition.\nThe committee would choose one at the height of his career — that\nis, someone whose best work was behind him — and hand over the\nproject with copious free advice about how the book should show in\npositive terms the strength and diversity of the American people,\netc, etc.<br/><br/>The unfortunate writer would then sit down to work with a huge\nweight of expectation on his shoulders.  Not wanting to blow such\na public commission, he'd play it safe.  This book had better command\nrespect, and the way to ensure that would be to make it a tragedy.\nAudiences have to be enticed to laugh, but if you kill people they\nfeel obliged to take you seriously.  As everyone knows, America\nplus tragedy equals the Civil War, so that's what it would have to\nbe about. When finally\ncompleted twelve years later, the book would be a 900-page pastiche\nof existing popular novels — roughly <i>Gone with the Wind</i> plus\n<i>Roots</i>.  But its bulk and celebrity would make it a bestseller\nfor a few months, until blown out of the water by a talk-show host's\nautobiography.  The book would be made into a movie and thereupon\nforgotten, except by the more waspish sort of reviewers, among whom\nit would be a byword for bogusness like Milli Vanilli or <i>Battlefield\nEarth</i>.<br/><br/>Maybe I got a little carried away with this example.  And yet is\nthis not at each point the way such a project would play out?  The\ngovernment knows better than to get into the novel business, but\nin other fields where they have a natural monopoly, like nuclear\nwaste dumps, aircraft carriers, and regime change, you'd find plenty\nof projects isomorphic to this one — and indeed, plenty that were\nless successful.<br/><br/>This little thought experiment suggests a few of the disadvantages\nof insider projects: the selection of the wrong kind of people, the\nexcessive scope, the inability to take risks, the need to seem\nserious, the weight of expectations, the power of vested interests,\nthe undiscerning audience, and perhaps most dangerous, the tendency\nof such work to become a duty rather than a pleasure.<br/><br/><b>Tests</b><br/><br/>A world with outsiders and insiders implies some kind of test for\ndistinguishing between them.  And the trouble with most tests for\nselecting elites is that there are two ways to pass them: to be\ngood at what they try to measure, and to be good at hacking the\ntest itself.<br/><br/>So the first question to ask about a field is how honest its tests\nare, because this tells you what it means to be an outsider.  This\ntells you how much to trust your instincts when you disagree with\nauthorities, whether it's worth going through the usual channels\nto become one yourself, and perhaps whether you want to work in\nthis field at all.<br/><br/>Tests are least hackable when there are consistent standards for\nquality, and the people running the test really care about its\nintegrity.  Admissions to PhD programs in the hard sciences are\nfairly honest, for example.  The professors will get whoever they\nadmit as their own grad students, so they try hard to choose well,\nand they have a fair amount of data to go on.  Whereas undergraduate\nadmissions seem to be much more hackable.<br/><br/>One way to tell whether a field has consistent standards is the\noverlap between the leading practitioners and the people who teach\nthe subject in universities.  At one end of the scale you have\nfields like math and physics, where nearly all the teachers are\namong the best practitioners.  In the middle are medicine, law,\nhistory, architecture, and computer science, where many are.  At\nthe bottom are business, literature, and the visual arts, where\nthere's almost no overlap between the teachers and the leading\npractitioners.  It's this end that gives rise to phrases like \"those\nwho can't do, teach.\"<br/><br/>Incidentally, this scale might be helpful in deciding what to study\nin college.  When I was in college the rule seemed to be that you\nshould study whatever you were most interested in.  But in retrospect\nyou're probably better off studying something moderately interesting\nwith someone who's good at it than something very interesting with\nsomeone who isn't.  You often hear people say that you shouldn't\nmajor in business in college, but this is actually an instance of\na more general rule: don't learn things from teachers who are bad\nat them.<br/><br/>How much you should worry about being an outsider depends on the\nquality of the insiders.  If you're an amateur mathematician and\nthink you've solved a famous open problem, better go back and check.\nWhen I was in grad school, a friend in the math department had the\njob of replying to people who sent in proofs of Fermat's last theorem\nand so on, and it did not seem as if he saw it as a valuable source\nof tips — more like manning a mental health hotline.  Whereas if\nthe stuff you're writing seems different from what English professors\nare interested in, that's not necessarily a problem.<br/><br/><b>Anti-Tests</b><br/><br/>Where the method of selecting the elite is thoroughly corrupt, most\nof the good people will be outsiders.  In art, for example, the\nimage of the poor, misunderstood genius is not just one possible\nimage of a great artist: it's the <i>standard</i> image.  I'm not\nsaying it's correct, incidentally, but it is telling how well this\nimage has stuck.  You couldn't make a rap like that stick to math\nor medicine.  \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f2n\"><font color=\"#777777\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>If it's corrupt enough, a test becomes an anti-test, filtering out\nthe people it should select by making them to do things only the\nwrong people would do.  <a href=\"nerds.html\">Popularity</a> in high school\nseems to be such a test.  There are plenty of similar ones in the grownup\nworld.  For example, rising up through the hierarchy of the average\nbig company demands an attention to politics few thoughtful people\ncould spare.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f3n\"><font color=\"#777777\">3</font></a>]</font>\nSomeone like Bill Gates can grow a company under\nhim, but it's hard to imagine him having the patience to climb the\ncorporate ladder at General Electric — or Microsoft, actually.<br/><br/>It's kind of strange when you think about it, because lord-of-the-flies\nschools and bureaucratic companies are both the default.  There are\nprobably a lot of people who go from one to the other and never\nrealize the whole world doesn't work this way.<br/><br/>I think that's one reason big companies are so often blindsided by\nstartups.  \nPeople at big companies don't realize the extent to which\nthey live in an environment that is one large, ongoing test for the\nwrong qualities.<br/><br/>If you're an outsider, your best chances for beating insiders are\nobviously in fields where corrupt tests select a lame elite.  But\nthere's a catch: if the tests are corrupt, your victory won't be\nrecognized, at least in your lifetime.  You may feel you don't need\nthat, but history suggests it's dangerous to work in fields with\ncorrupt tests.  You may beat the insiders, and yet not do as good\nwork, on an absolute scale, as you would in a field that was more\nhonest.<br/><br/>Standards in art, for example, were almost as corrupt in the first\nhalf of the eighteenth century as they are today.  This was the era\nof those fluffy idealized portraits of countesses with their lapdogs.\n<a href=\"largilliere-chardin.html\">Chardin</a> \ndecided to skip all that and paint ordinary things as he\nsaw them.  He's now considered the best of that period — and yet\nnot the equal of Leonardo or Bellini or Memling, who all had the\nadditional encouragement of honest standards.<br/><br/>It can be worth participating in a corrupt contest, however, if\nit's followed by another that isn't corrupt.  For example, it would\nbe worth competing with a company that can spend more than you on\nmarketing, as long as you can survive to the next round, when\ncustomers compare your actual products.  Similarly, you shouldn't\nbe discouraged by the comparatively corrupt test of college admissions,\nbecause it's followed immediately by less hackable tests.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f4n\"><font color=\"#777777\">4</font></a>]</font><br/><br/><b>Risk</b><br/><br/>Even in a field with honest tests, there are still advantages to\nbeing an outsider.  The most obvious is that outsiders have nothing\nto lose.  They can do risky things, and if they fail, so what?  Few\nwill even notice.<br/><br/>The eminent, on the other hand, are weighed down by their eminence.\nEminence is like a suit: it impresses the wrong people, and it\nconstrains the wearer.<br/><br/>Outsiders should realize the advantage they have here.  Being able\nto take risks is hugely valuable.  Everyone values safety too much,\nboth the obscure and the eminent.  No one wants to look like a fool.\nBut it's very useful to be able to.  If most of your ideas aren't\nstupid, you're probably being too conservative.  You're not bracketing\nthe problem.<br/><br/>Lord Acton said we should judge talent at its best and character\nat its worst.  For example, if you write one great book and ten bad\nones, you still count as a great writer — or at least, a better\nwriter than someone who wrote eleven that were merely good.  Whereas\nif you're a quiet, law-abiding citizen most of the time but\noccasionally cut someone up and bury them in your backyard, you're\na bad guy.<br/><br/>Almost everyone makes the mistake of treating ideas as if they were\nindications of character rather than talent — as if having a stupid\nidea made you stupid.   There's a huge weight of tradition advising\nus to play it safe.  \"Even a fool is thought wise if he keeps\nsilent,\" says the Old Testament (Proverbs 17:28).<br/><br/>Well, that may be fine advice for a bunch of goatherds in Bronze\nAge Palestine.  There conservatism would be the order of the day.\nBut times have changed.  It might still be reasonable to stick with\nthe Old Testament in political questions, but materially the world\nnow has a lot more state.  Tradition is less of a guide, not just\nbecause things change faster, but because the space of possibilities\nis so large.   The more complicated the world gets, the more valuable\nit is to be willing to look like a fool.<br/><br/><b>Delegation</b><br/><br/>And yet the more successful people become, the more heat they get\nif they screw up — or even seem to screw up.  In this respect, as\nin many others, the eminent are prisoners of their own success.  So\nthe best way to understand the advantages of being an outsider may\nbe to look at the disadvantages of being an insider.<br/><br/>If you ask eminent people what's wrong with their lives, the first\nthing they'll complain about is the lack of time.  A friend of mine\nat Google is fairly high up in the company and went to work for\nthem long before they went public.  In other words, he's now rich\nenough not to have to work.  I asked him if he could still endure\nthe annoyances of having a job, now that he didn't have to.  And\nhe said that there weren't really any annoyances, except — and he\ngot a wistful look when he said this — that he got <i>so much\nemail</i>.<br/><br/>The eminent feel like everyone wants to take a bite out of them.\nThe problem is so widespread that people pretending to be eminent\ndo it by pretending to be overstretched.<br/><br/>The lives of the eminent become scheduled, and that's not good for\nthinking.  One of the great advantages of being an outsider is long,\nuninterrupted blocks of time.  That's what I remember about grad\nschool: apparently endless supplies of time, which I spent worrying\nabout, but not writing, my dissertation.  Obscurity is like health\nfood — unpleasant, perhaps, but good for you.  Whereas fame tends\nto be like the alcohol produced by fermentation. When it reaches\na certain concentration, it kills off the yeast that produced it.<br/><br/>The eminent generally respond to the shortage of time by turning\ninto managers.  They don't have time to work.  They're surrounded\nby junior people they're supposed to help or supervise.  The obvious\nsolution is to have the junior people do the work.  Some good\nstuff happens this way, but there are problems it doesn't work so\nwell for: the kind where it helps to have everything in one head.<br/><br/>For example, it recently emerged that the famous glass artist Dale\nChihuly hasn't actually blown glass for 27 years.  He has assistants\ndo the work for him.  But one of the most valuable sources of ideas\nin the visual arts is the resistance of the medium.  That's why oil\npaintings look so different from watercolors.  In principle you\ncould make any mark in any medium; in practice the medium steers\nyou.  And if you're no longer doing the work yourself, you stop\nlearning from this.<br/><br/>So if you want to beat those eminent enough to delegate, one way\nto do it is to take advantage of direct contact with the medium.\nIn the arts it's obvious how: blow your own glass, edit your own\nfilms, stage your own plays.  And in the process pay close attention\nto accidents and to new ideas you have on the fly.  This technique\ncan be generalized to any sort of work: if you're an outsider, don't\nbe ruled by plans.  Planning is often just a weakness forced on\nthose who delegate.<br/><br/>Is there a general rule for finding problems best solved in one\nhead?  Well, you can manufacture them by taking any project usually\ndone by multiple people and trying to do it all yourself.  Wozniak's\nwork was a classic example: he did everything himself, hardware and\nsoftware, and the result was miraculous.  He claims not one bug was\never found in the Apple II, in either hardware or software.<br/><br/>Another way to find good problems to solve in one head is to focus\non the grooves in the chocolate bar — the places where tasks are\ndivided when they're split between several people.  If you want to\nbeat delegation, focus on a vertical slice: for example, be both\nwriter and editor, or both design buildings and construct them.<br/><br/>One especially good groove to span is the one between tools and\nthings made with them.  For example, programming languages and\napplications are usually written by different people, and this is\nresponsible for a lot of the worst flaws in \n<a href=\"hundred.html\">programming languages</a>.\nI think every language should be designed simultaneously with a\nlarge application written in it, the way C was with Unix.<br/><br/>Techniques for competing with delegation translate well into business,\nbecause delegation is endemic there.  Instead of avoiding it as a\ndrawback of senility, many companies embrace it as a sign of maturity.\nIn big companies software is often designed, implemented, and sold\nby three separate types of people.  In startups one person may have\nto do all three.  And though this feels stressful, it's one reason\nstartups win.  The needs of customers and the means of satisfying\nthem are all in one head.<br/><br/><b>Focus</b><br/><br/>The very skill of insiders can be a weakness.  Once someone is good\nat something, they tend to spend all their time doing that.  This\nkind of focus is very valuable, actually.  Much of the skill of\nexperts is the ability to ignore false trails.  But focus has\ndrawbacks: you don't learn from other fields, and when a new approach\narrives, you may be the last to notice.<br/><br/>For outsiders this translates into two ways to win.  One is to work\non a variety of things.  Since you can't derive as much benefit\n(yet) from a narrow focus, you may as well cast a wider net and\nderive what benefit you can from similarities between fields.  Just\nas you can compete with delegation by working on larger vertical\nslices, you can compete with specialization by working on larger\nhorizontal slices — by both writing and illustrating your book, for\nexample.<br/><br/>The second way to compete with focus is to see what focus overlooks.\nIn particular, new things.  So if you're not good at anything yet,\nconsider working on something so new that no one else is either.\nIt won't have any prestige yet, if no one is good at it, but you'll\nhave it all to yourself.<br/><br/>The potential of a new medium is usually underestimated, precisely\nbecause no one has yet explored its possibilities.  Before \n<a href=\"pilate.html\">Durer</a>\ntried making engravings, no one took them very seriously.  Engraving\nwas for making little devotional images — basically fifteenth century\nbaseball cards of saints.  Trying to make masterpieces in this\nmedium must have seemed to Durer's contemporaries the way that,\nsay, making masterpieces in \n<a href=\"http://www.fantagraphics.com/artist/clowes/clowes.html\">comics</a> \nmight seem to the average person\ntoday.<br/><br/>In the computer world we get not new mediums but new platforms: the\nminicomputer, the microprocessor, the web-based application.  At\nfirst they're always dismissed as being unsuitable for real work.\nAnd yet someone always decides to try anyway, and it turns out you\ncan do more than anyone expected.  So in the future when you hear\npeople say of a new platform: yeah, it's popular and cheap, but not\nready yet for real work, jump on it.<br/><br/>As well as being more comfortable working on established lines,\ninsiders generally have a vested interest in perpetuating them.\nThe professor who made his reputation by discovering some new idea\nis not likely to be the one to discover its replacement.  This is\nparticularly true with companies, who have not only skill and pride\nanchoring them to the status quo, but money as well. The Achilles\nheel of successful companies is their inability to cannibalize\nthemselves.  Many innovations consist of replacing something with\na cheaper alternative, and companies just don't want to see a path\nwhose immediate effect is to cut an existing source of revenue.<br/><br/>So if you're an outsider you should actively seek out contrarian\nprojects.  Instead of working on things the eminent have made\nprestigious, work on things that could steal that prestige.<br/><br/>The really juicy new approaches are not the ones insiders reject\nas impossible, but those they ignore as undignified.  For example,\nafter Wozniak designed the Apple II he offered it first to his\nemployer, HP.  They passed.  One of the reasons was that, to save\nmoney, he'd designed the Apple II to use a TV as a monitor, and HP\nfelt they couldn't produce anything so declasse.<br/><br/><b>Less</b><br/><br/>Wozniak used a TV as a monitor for the simple reason that he couldn't\nafford a monitor.  Outsiders are not merely free but compelled to\nmake things that are cheap and lightweight.  And both are good bets\nfor growth: cheap things spread faster, and lightweight things\nevolve faster.<br/><br/>The eminent, on the other hand, are almost forced to work on a large\nscale.  Instead of garden sheds they must design huge art museums.\nOne reason they work on big things is that they can: like our\nhypothetical novelist, they're flattered by such opportunities.\nThey also know that big projects will by their sheer bulk impress\nthe audience.  A garden shed, however lovely, would be easy to\nignore; a few might even snicker at it.  You can't snicker at a\ngiant museum, no matter how much you dislike it.  And finally, there\nare all those people the eminent have working for them; they have\nto choose projects that can keep them all busy.<br/><br/>Outsiders are free of all this.  They can work on small things, and\nthere's something very pleasing about small things.  Small things\ncan be perfect; big ones always have something wrong with them.\nBut there's a \n<a href=\"isetta.html\">magic</a> \nin small things that goes beyond such rational\nexplanations.  All kids know it.  Small things have more personality.<br/><br/>Plus making them is more fun.  You can do what you want; you don't\nhave to satisfy committees.  And perhaps most important, small\nthings can be done fast.  The prospect of seeing the finished project\nhangs in the air like the smell of dinner cooking.  If you work\nfast, maybe you could have it done tonight.<br/><br/>Working on small things is also a good way to learn.  The most\nimportant kinds of learning happen one project at a time.  (\"Next\ntime, I won't...\")  The faster you cycle through projects, the\nfaster you'll evolve.<br/><br/>Plain materials have a charm like small scale.  And in addition\nthere's the challenge of making do with less.  Every designer's\nears perk up at the mention of that game, because it's a game you\ncan't lose.  Like the JV playing the varsity, if you even tie, you\nwin.  So paradoxically there are cases where fewer resources yield\nbetter results, because the designers' pleasure at their own ingenuity\nmore than compensates.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f5n\"><font color=\"#777777\">5</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>So if you're an outsider, take advantage of your ability to make\nsmall and inexpensive things.  Cultivate the pleasure and simplicity\nof that kind of work; one day you'll miss it.<br/><br/><b>Responsibility</b><br/><br/>When you're old and eminent, what will you miss about being young\nand obscure?  What people seem to miss most is the lack of\nresponsibilities.<br/><br/>Responsibility is an occupational disease of eminence.  In principle\nyou could avoid it, just as in principle you could avoid getting\nfat as you get old, but few do.  I sometimes suspect that responsibility\nis a trap and that the most virtuous route would be to shirk it,\nbut regardless it's certainly constraining.<br/><br/>When you're an outsider you're constrained too, of course.  You're\nshort of money, for example.  But that constrains you in different\nways.  How does responsibility constrain you?  The worst thing is\nthat it allows you not to focus on real work.  Just as the most\ndangerous forms of \n<a href=\"procrastination.html\">procrastination</a> \nare those that seem like work,\nthe danger of responsibilities is not just that they can consume a\nwhole day, but that they can do it without setting off the\nkind of alarms you'd set off if you spent a whole day sitting on a\npark bench.<br/><br/>A lot of the pain of being an outsider is being aware of one's own\nprocrastination.  But this is actually a good thing.  You're at\nleast close enough to work that the smell of it makes you hungry.<br/><br/>As an outsider, you're just one step away from getting things done.\nA huge step, admittedly, and one that most people never seem to\nmake, but only one step.  If you can summon up the energy to get\nstarted, you can work on projects with an intensity (in both senses)\nthat few insiders can match.  For insiders work turns into a duty,\nladen with responsibilities and expectations.  It's never so pure\nas it was when they were young.<br/><br/>Work like a dog being taken for a walk, instead of an ox being yoked\nto the plow.  That's what they miss.<br/><br/><b>Audience</b><br/><br/>A lot of outsiders make the mistake of doing the opposite; they\nadmire the eminent so much that they copy even their flaws.  Copying\nis a good way to learn, but copy the right things.  When I was in\ncollege I imitated the pompous diction of famous professors.  But\nthis wasn't what <i>made</i> them eminent — it was more a flaw their\neminence had allowed them to sink into.   Imitating it was like\npretending to have gout in order to seem rich.<br/><br/>Half the distinguishing qualities of the eminent are actually\ndisadvantages.  Imitating these is not only a waste of time, but\nwill make you seem a fool to your models, who are often well aware\nof it.<br/><br/>What are the genuine advantages of being an insider?  The greatest\nis an audience.  It often seems to outsiders that the great advantage\nof insiders is money — that they have the resources to do what they\nwant.  But so do people who inherit money, and that doesn't seem\nto help, not as much as an audience.  It's good for morale to know\npeople want to see what you're making; it draws work out of you.<br/><br/>If I'm right that the defining advantage of insiders is an audience,\nthen we live in exciting times, because just in the last ten years\nthe Internet has made audiences a lot more liquid.  Outsiders don't\nhave to content themselves anymore with a proxy audience of a few\nsmart friends.  Now, thanks to the Internet, they can start to grow\nthemselves actual audiences.  This is great news for the marginal,\nwho retain the advantages of outsiders while increasingly being\nable to siphon off what had till recently been the prerogative of\nthe elite.<br/><br/>Though the Web has been around for more than ten years, I think\nwe're just beginning to see its democratizing effects.  Outsiders\nare still learning how to steal audiences.  But more importantly,\naudiences are still learning how to be stolen — they're still just\nbeginning to realize how much \n<a href=\"http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/2004/03/15/lott_case.html\">deeper</a> bloggers can dig than\njournalists, how much\n<a href=\"http://reddit.com\">more interesting</a> \na democratic news site can be than a\nfront page controlled by editors, and how much\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLbFDMplZDs\">funnier</a>\na bunch of kids\nwith webcams can be than mass-produced sitcoms.<br/><br/>The big media companies shouldn't worry that people will post their\ncopyrighted material on YouTube.  They should worry that people\nwill post their own stuff on YouTube, and audiences will watch that\ninstead.<br/><br/><b>Hacking</b><br/><br/>If I had to condense the power of the marginal into one sentence\nit would be: just try hacking something together.  That phrase draws\nin most threads I've mentioned here.   Hacking something together\nmeans deciding what to do as you're doing it, not a subordinate\nexecuting the vision of his boss.  It implies the result won't\nbe pretty, because it will be made quickly out of inadequate\nmaterials.  It may work, but it won't be the sort of thing the\neminent would want to put their name on.  Something hacked together\nmeans something that barely solves the problem, or maybe doesn't\nsolve the problem at all, but another you discovered en route.  But\nthat's ok, because the main value of that initial version is not the\nthing itself, but what it leads to.  Insiders who daren't walk\nthrough the mud in their nice clothes will never make it to the\nsolid ground on the other side.<br/><br/>The word \"try\" is an especially valuable component.  I disagree\nhere with Yoda, who said there is no try.  There is try.  It implies\nthere's no punishment if you fail.  You're driven by curiosity\ninstead of duty.  That means the wind of procrastination will be\nin your favor: instead of avoiding this work, this will be what you\ndo as a way of avoiding other work.  And when you do it, you'll be\nin a better mood.  The more the work depends on imagination, the\nmore that matters, because most people have more ideas when they're\nhappy.<br/><br/>If I could go back and redo my twenties, that would be one thing\nI'd do more of: just try hacking things together.  Like many people\nthat age, I spent a lot of time worrying about what I should do.\nI also spent some time trying to build stuff.  I should have spent\nless time worrying and more time building.  If you're not sure what\nto do, make something.<br/><br/>Raymond Chandler's advice to thriller writers was \"When in doubt,\nhave a man come through a door with a gun in his hand.\"  He followed\nthat advice.  Judging from his books, he was often in doubt.  But\nthough the result is occasionally cheesy, it's never boring.  In\nlife, as in books, action is underrated.<br/><br/>Fortunately the number of things you can just hack together keeps\nincreasing.   People fifty years ago would be astonished that one\ncould just hack together a movie, for example.  Now you can even\nhack together distribution.  Just make stuff and put it online.<br/><br/><b>Inappropriate</b><br/><br/>If you really want to score big, the place to focus is the margin\nof the margin: the territories only recently captured from the\ninsiders.  That's where you'll find the juiciest projects still\nundone, either because they seemed too risky, or simply because\nthere were too few insiders to explore everything.<br/><br/>This is why I spend most of my time writing \n<a href=\"essay.html\">essays</a> lately.  The\nwriting of essays used to be limited to those who could get them\npublished.  In principle you could have written them and just shown\nthem to your friends; in practice that didn't work.  \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f6n\"><font color=\"#777777\">6</font></a>]</font>\nAn\nessayist needs the resistance of an audience, just as an engraver\nneeds the resistance of the plate.<br/><br/>Up till a few years ago, writing essays was the ultimate insider's\ngame.  Domain experts were allowed to publish essays about their\nfield, but the pool allowed to write on general topics was about\neight people who went to the right parties in New York.  Now the\nreconquista has overrun this territory, and, not surprisingly, found\nit sparsely cultivated.  There are so many essays yet unwritten.\nThey tend to be the naughtier ones; the insiders have pretty much\nexhausted the motherhood and apple pie topics.<br/><br/>This leads to my final suggestion: a technique for determining when\nyou're on the right track.  You're on the right track when people\ncomplain that you're unqualified, or that you've done something\ninappropriate.  If people are complaining, that means you're doing\nsomething rather than sitting around, which is the first step.  And\nif they're driven to such empty forms of complaint, that means\nyou've probably done something good.<br/><br/>If you make something and people complain that it doesn't <i>work</i>,\nthat's a problem.  But if the worst thing they can hit you with is\nyour own status as an outsider, that implies that in every other\nrespect you've succeeded.  Pointing out that someone is unqualified\nis as desperate as resorting to racial slurs. It's just a legitimate\nsounding way of saying: we don't like your type around here.<br/><br/>But the best thing of all is when people call what you're doing\ninappropriate.  I've been hearing this word all my life and I only\nrecently realized that it is, in fact, the sound of the homing\nbeacon.  \"Inappropriate\" is the null criticism.  It's merely the\nadjective form of \"I don't like it.\"<br/><br/>So that, I think, should be the highest goal for the marginal.  Be\ninappropriate.  When you hear people saying that, you're golden.\nAnd they, incidentally, are busted.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nThe facts about Apple's early history are from an interview \nwith <a href=\"http://foundersatwork.com/steve-wozniak.html\">Steve \nWozniak</a> in Jessica Livingston's \n<i>Founders at Work</i>.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nAs usual the popular image is several decades behind reality.\nNow the misunderstood artist is not a chain-smoking drunk who pours\nhis soul into big, messy canvases that philistines see and say\n\"that's not art\" because it isn't a picture of anything.  The\nphilistines have now been trained that anything hung on a wall\nis art.  Now the misunderstood artist is a coffee-drinking vegan\ncartoonist whose work they see and say \"that's not art\" because it\nlooks like stuff they've seen in the Sunday paper.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nIn fact this would do fairly well as a definition of politics:\nwhat determines rank in the absence of objective tests.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f4n\"><font color=\"#000000\">4</font></a>]\nIn high school you're led to believe your whole future depends\non where you go to college, but it turns out only to buy you a couple\nyears. By your mid-twenties the people worth impressing\nalready judge you more by what\nyou've done than where you went to school.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f5n\"><font color=\"#000000\">5</font></a>]\nManagers are presumably wondering, how can I make this miracle\nhappen?  How can I make the people working for me do more with less?\nUnfortunately the constraint probably has to be self-imposed.  If\nyou're <i>expected</i> to do more with less, then you're being\nstarved, not eating virtuously.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f6n\"><font color=\"#000000\">6</font></a>]\nWithout the prospect of publication, the closest most people\ncome to writing essays is to write in a journal.  I find I never\nget as deeply into subjects as I do in proper essays.  As the name\nimplies, you don't go back and rewrite journal entries over\nand over for two weeks.<br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Paul Buchheit, Sarah\nHarlin, Jessica Livingston, Jackie McDonough, Robert Morris, Olin\nShivers, and Chris Small for reading drafts of this, and to Chris\nSmall and Chad Fowler for inviting me to speak.\n<!--\n<a href=\"http://reddit.com\"><img src=\"https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/redditino.png?t=1688221954&\" border=0></a>\n<a href=\"http://reddit.com/info/8mk5/comments\">\nComment</a> on this essay. --><br/><br/></br></p></font>","date":"2006-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
