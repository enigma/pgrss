{"href":"kids.html","title":"Having Kids","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">December 2019<br/><br/>Before I had kids, I was afraid of having kids. Up to that point I\nfelt about kids the way the young Augustine felt about living\nvirtuously. I'd have been sad to think I'd never have children.\nBut did I want them now? No.<br/><br/>If I had kids, I'd become a parent, and parents, as I'd known since\nI was a kid, were uncool. They were dull and responsible and had\nno fun.  And while it's not surprising that kids would believe that,\nto be honest I hadn't seen much as an adult to change my mind.\nWhenever I'd noticed parents with kids, the kids seemed to be\nterrors, and the parents pathetic harried creatures, even when they\nprevailed.<br/><br/>When people had babies, I congratulated them enthusiastically,\nbecause that seemed to be what one did. But I didn't feel it at\nall.  \"Better you than me,\" I was thinking.<br/><br/>Now when people have babies I congratulate them enthusiastically and\nI mean it. Especially the first one. I feel like they just got the best gift in the world.<br/><br/>What changed, of course, is that I had kids. Something I dreaded\nturned out to be wonderful.<br/><br/>Partly, and I won't deny it, this is because of serious chemical\nchanges that happened almost instantly when our first child was\nborn.  It was like someone flipped a switch. I suddenly felt\nprotective not just toward our child, but toward all children. As I was\ndriving my wife and new son home from the hospital, I approached a\ncrosswalk full of pedestrians, and I found myself thinking \"I have\nto be really careful of all these people. Every one of them is\nsomeone's child!\"<br/><br/>So to some extent you can't trust me when I say having kids is\ngreat.  To some extent I'm like a religious cultist telling you\nthat you'll be happy if you join the cult too � but only because\njoining the cult will alter your mind in a way that will make you\nhappy to be a cult member.<br/><br/>But not entirely. There were some things\nabout having kids that I clearly got wrong before I had them.<br/><br/>For example, there was a huge amount of selection bias in my\nobservations of parents and children. Some parents may have noticed\nthat I wrote \"Whenever I'd noticed parents with kids.\" Of course\nthe times I noticed kids were when things were going wrong. I only\nnoticed them when they made noise. And where was I when I noticed\nthem?  Ordinarily I never went to places with kids, so the only\ntimes I encountered them were in shared bottlenecks like airplanes.\nWhich is not exactly a representative sample. Flying with a toddler\nis something very few parents enjoy.<br/><br/>What I didn't notice, because they tend to be much quieter, were\nall the great moments parents had with kids. People don't talk about\nthese much � the magic is hard to put into words, and all other\nparents know about them anyway � but one of the great things about\nhaving kids is that there are so many times when you feel there is\nnowhere else you'd rather be, and nothing else you'd rather be\ndoing.  You don't have to be doing anything special. You could just\nbe going somewhere together, or putting them to bed, or pushing\nthem on the swings at the park. But you wouldn't trade these moments\nfor anything. One doesn't tend to associate kids with peace, but\nthat's what you feel.  You don't need to look any\nfurther than where you are right now.<br/><br/>Before I had kids, I had moments of this kind of peace, but they\nwere rarer. With kids it can happen several times a day.<br/><br/>My other source of data about kids was my own childhood, and that\nwas similarly misleading. I was pretty bad, and was always in trouble\nfor something or other. So it seemed to me that parenthood was\nessentially law enforcement.  I didn't realize there were good times\ntoo.<br/><br/>I remember my mother telling me once when I was about 30 that she'd\nreally enjoyed having me and my sister. My god, I thought, this\nwoman is a saint. She not only endured all the pain we subjected\nher to, but actually enjoyed it? Now I realize she was simply telling\nthe truth.<br/><br/>She said that one reason she liked having us was that we'd been\ninteresting to talk to. That took me by surprise when I had kids.\nYou don't just love them. They become your friends too. They're\nreally interesting. And while I admit small children are disastrously\nfond of repetition (anything worth doing once is worth doing fifty\ntimes) it's often genuinely fun to play with them.  That surprised\nme too. Playing with a 2 year old was fun when I was 2 and definitely\nnot fun when I was 6. Why would it become fun again later? But it\ndoes.<br/><br/>There are of course times that are pure drudgery. Or worse still,\nterror. Having kids is one of those intense types of experience\nthat are hard to imagine unless you've had them. But it is not, as I\nimplicitly believed before having kids, simply your DNA heading for\nthe lifeboats.<br/><br/>Some of my worries about having kids were right, though. They\ndefinitely make you less productive. I know having kids makes some\npeople get their act together, but if your act was already together,\nyou're going to have less time to do it in. In particular, you're\ngoing to have to work to a schedule. Kids have schedules.  I'm not\nsure if it's because that's how kids are, or because it's the only\nway to integrate their lives with adults', but once you have kids,\nyou tend to have to work on their schedule.<br/><br/>You will have chunks of time to work. But you can't let work spill\npromiscuously through your whole life, like I used to before I had\nkids. You're going to have to work at the same time every day,\nwhether inspiration is flowing or not, and there are going to be\ntimes when you have to stop, even if it is.<br/><br/>I've been able to adapt to working this way. Work, like love, finds\na way. If there are only certain times it can happen, it happens\nat those times. So while I don't get as much done as before I had\nkids, I get enough done.<br/><br/>I hate to say this, because being ambitious has always been a part\nof my identity, but having kids may make one less ambitious. It\nhurts to see that sentence written down. I squirm to avoid it. But\nif there weren't something real there, why would I squirm?  The\nfact is, once you have kids, you're probably going to care more\nabout them than you do about yourself. And attention is a zero-sum\ngame. Only one idea at a time can be the \n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/top.html\"><u>top idea in your mind</u></a>.\nOnce you have kids, it will often be your kids, and that means it\nwill less often be some project you're working on.<br/><br/>I have some hacks for sailing close to this wind. For example, when\nI write essays, I think about what I'd want my kids to know. That\ndrives me to get things right. And when I was writing \n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/bel.html\"><u>Bel</u></a>, I told\nmy kids that once I finished it I'd take them to Africa. When you\nsay that sort of thing to a little kid, they treat it as a promise.\nWhich meant I had to finish or I'd be taking away their trip to\nAfrica.  Maybe if I'm really lucky such tricks could put me net\nahead. But the wind is there, no question.<br/><br/>On the other hand, what kind of wimpy ambition do you have if it\nwon't survive having kids? Do you have so little to spare?<br/><br/>And while having kids may be warping my present judgement, it hasn't\noverwritten my memory. I remember perfectly well what life was like\nbefore. Well enough to miss some things a lot, like the\nability to take off for some other country at a moment's notice.\nThat was so great. Why did I never do that?<br/><br/>See what I did there? The fact is, most of the freedom I had before\nkids, I never used. I paid for it in loneliness, but I never used\nit.<br/><br/>I had plenty of happy times before I had kids. But if I count up\nhappy moments, not just potential happiness but actual happy moments,\nthere are more after kids than before. Now I practically have it\non tap, almost any bedtime.<br/><br/>People's experiences as parents\nvary a lot, and I know I've been lucky. But I think the worries I\nhad before having kids must be pretty common, and judging by other\nparents' faces when they see their kids, so must the happiness that\nkids bring.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Note</b><br/><br/>[1] Adults are sophisticated enough to see 2 year olds for the\nfascinatingly complex characters they are, whereas to most 6 year\nolds, 2 year olds are just defective 6 year olds.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris\nfor reading drafts of this.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
