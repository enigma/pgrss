{"href":"whyyc.html","title":"Why YC","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">March 2006, rev August 2009<br/><br/>Yesterday one of the founders we funded asked me why we started \n<a href=\"http://ycombinator.com\">Y\nCombinator</a>.  Or more precisely, he asked if we'd started YC mainly\nfor fun.<br/><br/>Kind of, but not quite.  It is enormously fun to be able to work\nwith Rtm and Trevor again.  I missed that after we sold Viaweb, and\nfor all the years after I always had a background process running,\nlooking for something we could do together.  There is definitely\nan aspect of a band reunion to Y Combinator.  Every couple days I\nslip and call it \"Viaweb.\"<br/><br/>Viaweb we started very explicitly to make money.  I was sick of\nliving from one freelance project to the next, and decided to just\nwork as hard as I could till I'd made enough to solve the problem\nonce and for all.  Viaweb was sometimes fun, but it wasn't designed\nfor fun, and mostly it wasn't.  I'd be surprised if any startup is.\nAll startups are mostly schleps.<br/><br/>The real reason we started Y Combinator is neither selfish nor\nvirtuous.  We didn't start it mainly to make money; we have no idea\nwhat our average returns might be, and won't know for years.  Nor\ndid we start YC mainly to help out young would-be founders, though\nwe do like the idea, and comfort ourselves occasionally with the\nthought that if all our investments tank, we will thus have been\ndoing something unselfish.  (It's oddly nondeterministic.)<br/><br/>The real reason we started Y Combinator is one probably only a\n<a href=\"gba.html\">hacker</a> would understand.  We did it because it seems such a great\nhack.  There are thousands of smart people who could start companies\nand don't, and with a relatively small amount of force applied at\njust the right place, we can spring on the world a stream of new\nstartups that might otherwise not have existed.<br/><br/>In a way this is virtuous, because I think startups are a good\nthing.  But really what motivates us is the completely amoral desire\nthat would motivate any hacker who looked at some complex device\nand realized that with a tiny tweak he could make it run more\nefficiently.  In this case, the device is the world's economy, which\nfortunately happens to be open source.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2006-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
