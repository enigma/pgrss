{"href":"goodtaste.html","title":"Is There Such a Thing as Good Taste?","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">November 2021<br/><br/><i>(This essay is derived from a talk at the Cambridge Union.)</i><br/><br/>When I was a kid, I'd have said there wasn't. My father told me so.\nSome people like some things, and other people like other things,\nand who's to say who's right?<br/><br/>It seemed so obvious that there was no such thing as good taste\nthat it was only through indirect evidence that I realized my father\nwas wrong. And that's what I'm going to give you here: a proof by\nreductio ad absurdum. If we start from the premise that there's no\nsuch thing as good taste, we end up with conclusions that are\nobviously false, and therefore the premise must be wrong.<br/><br/>We'd better start by saying what good taste is. There's a narrow\nsense in which it refers to aesthetic judgements and a broader one\nin which it refers to preferences of any kind. The strongest proof\nwould be to show that taste exists in the narrowest sense, so I'm\ngoing to talk about taste in art. You have better taste than me if\nthe art you like is better than the art I like.<br/><br/>If there's no such thing as good taste, then there's no such thing\nas <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/goodart.html\"><u>good art</u></a>. Because if there is such a\nthing as good art, it's\neasy to tell which of two people has better taste. Show them a lot\nof works by artists they've never seen before and ask them to\nchoose the best, and whoever chooses the better art has better\ntaste.<br/><br/>So if you want to discard the concept of good taste, you also have\nto discard the concept of good art. And that means you have to\ndiscard the possibility of people being good at making it. Which\nmeans there's no way for artists to be good at their jobs. And not\njust visual artists, but anyone who is in any sense an artist. You\ncan't have good actors, or novelists, or composers, or dancers\neither. You can have popular novelists, but not good ones.<br/><br/>We don't realize how far we'd have to go if we discarded the concept\nof good taste, because we don't even debate the most obvious cases.\nBut it doesn't just mean we can't say which of two famous painters\nis better. It means we can't say that any painter is better than a\nrandomly chosen eight year old.<br/><br/>That was how I realized my father was wrong. I started studying\npainting. And it was just like other kinds of work I'd done: you\ncould do it well, or badly, and if you tried hard, you could get\nbetter at it. And it was obvious that Leonardo and Bellini were\nmuch better at it than me. That gap between us was not imaginary.\nThey were so good. And if they could be good, then art could be\ngood, and there was such a thing as good taste after all.<br/><br/>Now that I've explained how to show there is such a thing as good\ntaste, I should also explain why people think there isn't. There\nare two reasons. One is that there's always so much disagreement\nabout taste. Most people's response to art is a tangle of unexamined\nimpulses. Is the artist famous? Is the subject attractive? Is this\nthe sort of art they're supposed to like? Is it hanging in a famous\nmuseum, or reproduced in a big, expensive book? In practice most\npeople's response to art is dominated by such extraneous factors.<br/><br/>And the people who do claim to have good taste are so often mistaken.\nThe paintings admired by the so-called experts in one generation\nare often so different from those admired a few generations later.\nIt's easy to conclude there's nothing real there at all. It's only\nwhen you isolate this force, for example by trying to paint and\ncomparing your work to Bellini's, that you can see that it does in\nfact exist.<br/><br/>The other reason people doubt that art can be good is that there\ndoesn't seem to be any room in the art for this goodness. The\nargument goes like this. Imagine several people looking at a work\nof art and judging how good it is. If being good art really is a\nproperty of objects, it should be in the object somehow. But it\ndoesn't seem to be; it seems to be something happening in the heads\nof each of the observers. And if they disagree, how do you choose\nbetween them?<br/><br/>The solution to this puzzle is to realize that the purpose of art\nis to work on its human audience, and humans have a lot in common.\nAnd to the extent the things an object acts upon respond in the\nsame way, that's arguably what it means for the object to have the\ncorresponding property. If everything a particle interacts with\nbehaves as if the particle had a mass of <i>m</i>, then it has a mass of\n<i>m</i>. So the distinction between \"objective\" and \"subjective\" is not\nbinary, but a matter of degree, depending on how much the subjects\nhave in common. Particles interacting with one another are at one\npole, but people interacting with art are not all the way at the\nother; their reactions aren't <i>random</i>.<br/><br/>Because people's responses to art aren't random, art can be designed\nto operate on people, and be good or bad depending on how effectively\nit does so. Much as a vaccine can be. If someone were talking about\nthe ability of a vaccine to confer immunity, it would seem very\nfrivolous to object that conferring immunity wasn't really a property\nof vaccines, because acquiring immunity is something that happens\nin the immune system of each individual person. Sure, people's\nimmune systems vary, and a vaccine that worked on one might not\nwork on another, but that doesn't make it meaningless to talk about\nthe effectiveness of a vaccine.<br/><br/>The situation with art is messier, of course. You can't measure\neffectiveness by simply taking a vote, as you do with vaccines.\nYou have to imagine the responses of subjects with a deep knowledge\nof art, and enough clarity of mind to be able to ignore extraneous\ninfluences like the fame of the artist. And even then you'd still\nsee some disagreement. People do vary, and judging art is hard,\nespecially recent art. There is definitely not a total order either\nof works or of people's ability to judge them. But there is equally\ndefinitely a partial order of both. So while it's not possible to\nhave perfect taste, it is possible to have good taste.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><font color=\"888888\">\n<b>Thanks</b> to the Cambridge Union for inviting me, and to Trevor\nBlackwell, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts\nof this.\n</font><br/><br/></font>","date":"2021-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
