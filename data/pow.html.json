{"href":"pow.html","title":"Charisma / Power","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">January 2017<br/><br/>People who are powerful but uncharismatic will tend to be disliked.\nTheir power makes them a target for criticism that they don't have\nthe charisma to disarm. That was Hillary Clinton's problem. It also\ntends to be a problem for any CEO who is more of a builder than a\nschmoozer. And yet the builder-type CEO is (like Hillary) probably\nthe best person for the job.<br/><br/>I don't think there is any solution to this problem. It's human\nnature. The best we can do is to recognize that it's happening, and\nto understand that being a magnet for criticism is sometimes a sign\nnot that someone is the wrong person for a job, but that they're\nthe right one.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
