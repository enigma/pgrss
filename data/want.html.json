{"href":"want.html","title":"What You (Want to)* Want","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">November 2022<br/><br/>Since I was about 9 I've been puzzled by the apparent contradiction\nbetween being made of matter that behaves in a predictable way, and\nthe feeling that I could choose to do whatever I wanted. At the\ntime I had a self-interested motive for exploring the question. At\nthat age (like most succeeding ages) I was always in trouble with\nthe authorities, and it seemed to me that there might possibly be\nsome way to get out of trouble by arguing that I wasn't responsible\nfor my actions. I gradually lost hope of that, but the puzzle\nremained: How do you reconcile being a machine made of matter with\nthe feeling that you're free to choose what you do?\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/want.html#f1n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The best way to explain the answer may be to start with a slightly\nwrong version, and then fix it. The wrong version is: You can do\nwhat you want, but you can't want what you want. Yes, you can control\nwhat you do, but you'll do what you want, and you can't control\nthat.<br/><br/>The reason this is mistaken is that people do sometimes change what\nthey want. People who don't want to want something — drug addicts,\nfor example — can sometimes make themselves stop wanting it. And\npeople who want to want something — who want to like classical\nmusic, or broccoli — sometimes succeed.<br/><br/>So we modify our initial statement: You can do what you want, but\nyou can't want to want what you want.<br/><br/>That's still not quite true. It's possible to change what you want\nto want. I can imagine someone saying \"I decided to stop wanting\nto like classical music.\" But we're getting closer to the truth.\nIt's rare for people to change what they want to want, and the more\n\"want to\"s we add, the rarer it gets.<br/><br/>We can get arbitrarily close to a true statement by adding more \"want\nto\"s in much the same way we can get arbitrarily close to 1 by adding\nmore 9s to a string of 9s following a decimal point. In practice\nthree or four \"want to\"s must surely be enough. It's hard even to\nenvision what it would mean to change what you want to want to want\nto want, let alone actually do it.<br/><br/>So one way to express the correct answer is to use a regular\nexpression. You can do what you want, but there's some statement\nof the form \"you can't (want to)* want what you want\" that's true.\nUltimately you get back to a want that you don't control.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/want.html#f2n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nI didn't know when I was 9 that matter might behave randomly,\nbut I don't think it affects the problem much.
