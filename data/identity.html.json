{"href":"identity.html","title":"Keep Your Identity Small","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">February 2009<br/><br/>I finally realized today why politics and religion yield such\nuniquely useless discussions.<br/><br/>As a rule, any mention of religion on an online forum degenerates\ninto a religious argument.  Why?  Why does this happen with religion\nand not with Javascript or baking or other topics people talk about\non forums?<br/><br/>What's different about religion is that people don't feel they need\nto have any particular expertise to have opinions about\nit.  All they need is strongly held beliefs, and anyone can have\nthose.  No thread about Javascript will grow as fast as one about\nreligion, because people feel they have to be over some threshold\nof expertise to post comments about that.  But on religion everyone's\nan expert.<br/><br/>Then it struck me: this is the problem with politics too.  Politics,\nlike religion, is a topic where there's no threshold of expertise\nfor expressing an opinion.  All you need is strong convictions.<br/><br/>Do religion and politics have something in common that explains\nthis similarity?  One possible explanation is that they deal with\nquestions that have no definite answers, so there's no back pressure\non people's opinions.  Since no one can be proven wrong, every\nopinion is equally valid, and sensing this, everyone lets fly with\ntheirs.<br/><br/>But this isn't true.  There are certainly some political questions\nthat have definite answers, like how much a new government policy\nwill cost.  But the more precise political questions suffer the\nsame fate as the vaguer ones.<br/><br/>I think what religion and politics have in common is that they\nbecome part of people's identity, and people can never have a\nfruitful argument about something that's part of their identity.\nBy definition they're partisan.<br/><br/>Which topics engage people's identity depends on the people, not\nthe topic.  For example, a discussion about a battle that included\ncitizens of one or more of the countries involved would probably\ndegenerate into a political argument.  But a discussion today about\na battle that took place in the Bronze Age probably wouldn't.  No\none would know what side to be on.  So it's not politics that's the\nsource of the trouble, but identity.  When people say a discussion\nhas degenerated into a religious war, what they really mean is that\nit has started to be driven mostly by people's identities.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/identity.html#f1n\"><font color=\"#999999\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Because the point at which this happens depends on the people rather\nthan the topic, it's a mistake to conclude that because a question\ntends to provoke religious wars, it must have no answer. For example,\nthe question of the relative merits of programming languages often\ndegenerates into a religious war, because so many programmers\nidentify as X programmers or Y programmers.  This sometimes leads\npeople to conclude the question must be unanswerable—that all\nlanguages are equally good.  Obviously that's false: anything else\npeople make can be well or badly designed; why should this be\nuniquely impossible for programming languages?  And indeed, you can\nhave a fruitful discussion about the relative merits of programming\nlanguages, so long as you exclude people who respond from identity.<br/><br/>More generally, you can have a fruitful discussion about a topic\nonly if it doesn't engage the identities of any of the\nparticipants.  What makes politics and religion such minefields is\nthat they engage so many people's identities.  But you could in\nprinciple have a useful conversation about them with some people.\nAnd there are other topics that might seem harmless, like the\nrelative merits of Ford and Chevy pickup trucks, that you couldn't\nsafely talk about with <a href=\"http://www.theledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060418/NEWS/604180378/1039\">others</a>.<br/><br/>The most intriguing thing about this theory, if it's right, is that\nit explains not merely which kinds of discussions to avoid, but how\nto have better ideas.  If people can't think clearly about anything\nthat has become part of their identity, then all other things being\nequal, the best plan is to let as few things into your identity as\npossible. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/identity.html#f2n\"><font color=\"#999999\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Most people reading this will already be fairly tolerant.  But there\nis a step beyond thinking of yourself as x but tolerating y: not\neven to consider yourself an x.  The more labels you have for\nyourself, the dumber they make you.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nWhen that happens, it tends to happen fast, like a core going\ncritical.  The threshold for participating goes down to zero, which\nbrings in more people.  And they tend to say incendiary things,\nwhich draw more and angrier counterarguments.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nThere may be some things it's a net win to include in your\nidentity.  For example, being a scientist.  But arguably that is\nmore of a placeholder than an actual label—like putting NMI on a\nform that asks for your middle initial—because it doesn't commit\nyou to believing anything in particular.   A scientist isn't committed\nto believing in natural selection in the same way a biblical\nliteralist is committed to rejecting it.  All he's committed to is\nfollowing the evidence wherever it leads.<br/><br/>Considering yourself a scientist is equivalent to putting a sign\nin a cupboard saying \"this cupboard must be kept empty.\"  Yes,\nstrictly speaking, you're putting something in the cupboard, but\nnot in the ordinary sense.<br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Paul Buchheit, and Robert\nMorris for reading drafts of this.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2009-02-01T00:00:00Z"}
