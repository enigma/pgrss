{"href":"hwh.html","title":"How to Work Hard","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">June 2021<br/><br/>It might not seem there's much to learn about how to work hard.\nAnyone who's been to school knows what it entails, even if they\nchose not to do it. There are 12 year olds who work amazingly hard. And\nyet when I ask if I know more about working hard now than when I\nwas in school, the answer is definitely yes.<br/><br/>One thing I know is that if you want to do great things, you'll\nhave to work very hard. I wasn't sure of that as a kid. Schoolwork\nvaried in difficulty; one didn't always have to work super hard to\ndo well. And some of the things famous adults did, they seemed to\ndo almost effortlessly. Was there, perhaps, some way to evade hard\nwork through sheer brilliance? Now I know the answer to that question.\nThere isn't.<br/><br/>The reason some subjects seemed easy was that my school had low\nstandards. And the reason famous adults seemed to do things\neffortlessly was years of practice; they made it look easy.<br/><br/>Of course, those famous adults usually had a lot of natural ability\ntoo. There are three ingredients in great work: natural ability,\npractice, and effort. You can do pretty well with just two, but to\ndo the best work you need all three: you need great natural ability\n<i>and</i> to have practiced a lot <i>and</i> to be trying very hard. \n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/hwh.html#f1n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Bill Gates, for example, was among the smartest people in business\nin his era, but he was also among the hardest working. \"I never\ntook a day off in my twenties,\" he said. \"Not one.\" It was similar\nwith Lionel Messi. He had great natural ability, but when his youth\ncoaches talk about him, what they remember is not his talent but\nhis dedication and his desire to win. P. G. Wodehouse would probably\nget my vote for best English writer of the 20th century, if I had\nto choose. Certainly no one ever made it look easier. But no one\never worked harder. At 74, he wrote\n<blockquote>\n  with each new book of mine I have, as I say, the feeling that\n  this time I have picked a lemon in the garden of literature. A\n  good thing, really, I suppose. Keeps one up on one's toes and\n  makes one rewrite every sentence ten times. Or in many cases\n  twenty times.\n</blockquote>\nSounds a bit extreme, you think. And yet Bill Gates sounds even\nmore extreme. Not one day off in ten years?  These two had about\nas much natural ability as anyone could have, and yet they also\nworked about as hard as anyone could work. You need both.<br/><br/>That seems so obvious, and yet in practice we find it slightly hard\nto grasp. There's a faint xor between talent and hard work. It comes\npartly from popular culture, where it seems to run very deep, and\npartly from the fact that the outliers are so rare. If great talent\nand great drive are both rare, then people with both are rare\nsquared. Most people you meet who have a lot of one will have less\nof the other. But you'll need both if you want to be an outlier\nyourself. And since you can't really change how much natural talent\nyou have, in practice doing great work, insofar as you can, reduces\nto working very hard.<br/><br/>It's straightforward to work hard if you have clearly defined,\nexternally imposed goals, as you do in school. There is some technique\nto it: you have to learn not to lie to yourself, not to procrastinate\n(which is a form of lying to yourself), not to get distracted, and\nnot to give up when things go wrong. But this level of discipline\nseems to be within the reach of quite young children, if they want\nit.<br/><br/>What I've learned since I was a kid is how to work toward goals\nthat are neither clearly defined nor externally imposed. You'll\nprobably have to learn both if you want to do really great things.<br/><br/>The most basic level of which is simply to feel you should be working\nwithout anyone telling you to. Now, when I'm not working hard, alarm\nbells go off. I can't be sure I'm getting anywhere when I'm working\nhard, but I can be sure I'm getting nowhere when I'm not, and it\nfeels awful.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/hwh.html#f2n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>There wasn't a single point when I learned this. Like most little\nkids, I enjoyed the feeling of achievement when I learned or did\nsomething new. As I grew older, this morphed into a feeling of\ndisgust when I wasn't achieving anything. The one precisely dateable\nlandmark I have is when I stopped watching TV, at age 13.<br/><br/>Several people I've talked to remember getting serious about work\naround this age. When I asked Patrick Collison when he started to\nfind idleness distasteful, he said\n<blockquote>\n  I think around age 13 or 14. I have a clear memory from around\n  then of sitting in the sitting room, staring outside, and wondering\n  why I was wasting my summer holiday.\n</blockquote>\nPerhaps something changes at adolescence. That would make sense.<br/><br/>Strangely enough, the biggest obstacle to getting serious about\nwork was probably school, which made work (what they called work)\nseem boring and pointless. I had to learn what real work was before\nI could wholeheartedly desire to do it. That took a while, because\neven in college a lot of the work is pointless; there are entire\ndepartments that are pointless. But as I learned the shape of real\nwork, I found that my desire to do it slotted into it as if they'd\nbeen made for each other.<br/><br/>I suspect most people have to learn what work is before they can\nlove it. Hardy wrote eloquently about this in <i>A Mathematician's\nApology</i>:\n<blockquote>\n  I do not remember having felt, as a boy, any <i>passion</i> for\n  mathematics, and such notions as I may have had of the career of\n  a mathematician were far from noble. I thought of mathematics in\n  terms of examinations and scholarships: I wanted to beat other\n  boys, and this seemed to be the way in which I could do so most\n  decisively.\n</blockquote>\nHe didn't learn what math was really about till part way through\ncollege, when he read Jordan's <i>Cours d'analyse</i>.\n<blockquote>\n  I shall never forget the astonishment with which I read that\n  remarkable work, the first inspiration for so many mathematicians\n  of my generation, and learnt for the first time as I read it what\n  mathematics really meant.\n</blockquote>\nThere are two separate kinds of fakeness you need to learn to\ndiscount in order to understand what real work is. One is the kind\nHardy encountered in school. Subjects get distorted when they're\nadapted to be taught to kids — often so distorted that they're\nnothing like the work done by actual practitioners.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/hwh.html#f3n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">3</font></a>]</font>\nThe other\nkind of fakeness is intrinsic to certain types of work. Some types\nof work are inherently bogus, or at best mere busywork.<br/><br/>There's a kind of solidity to real work. It's not all writing the\n<i>Principia</i>, but it all feels necessary. That's a vague criterion,\nbut it's deliberately vague, because it has to cover a lot of\ndifferent types.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/hwh.html#f4n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">4</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Once you know the shape of real work, you have to learn how many\nhours a day to spend on it. You can't solve this problem by simply\nworking every waking hour, because in many kinds of work there's a\npoint beyond which the quality of the result will start to decline.<br/><br/>That limit varies depending on the type of work and the person.\nI've done several different kinds of work, and the limits were\ndifferent for each. My limit for the harder types of writing or\nprogramming is about five hours a day. Whereas when I was running\na startup, I could\nwork all the time. At least for the three years I did it; if I'd\nkept going much longer, I'd probably have needed to take occasional\nvacations.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/hwh.html#f5n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">5</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The only way to find the limit is by crossing it. Cultivate a\nsensitivity to the quality of the work you're doing, and then you'll\nnotice if it decreases because you're working too hard. Honesty is\ncritical here, in both directions: you have to notice when you're\nbeing lazy, but also when you're working too hard. And if you think\nthere's something admirable about working too hard, get that idea\nout of your head. You're not merely getting worse results, but\ngetting them because you're showing off — if not to other people,\nthen to yourself.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/hwh.html#f6n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">6</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Finding the limit of working hard is a constant, ongoing process,\nnot something you do just once. Both the difficulty of the work and\nyour ability to do it can vary hour to hour, so you need to be\nconstantly judging both how hard you're trying and how well you're\ndoing.<br/><br/>Trying hard doesn't mean constantly pushing yourself to work, though.\nThere may be some people who do, but I think my experience is fairly\ntypical, and I only have to push myself occasionally when I'm\nstarting a project or when I encounter some sort of check. That's\nwhen I'm in danger of procrastinating. But once I get rolling, I\ntend to keep going.<br/><br/>What keeps me going depends on the type of work. When I was working\non Viaweb, I was driven by fear of failure. I barely procrastinated\nat all then, because there was always something that needed doing,\nand if I could put more distance between me and the pursuing beast\nby doing it, why wait? <font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/hwh.html#f7n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">7</font></a>]</font>\nWhereas what drives me now, writing\nessays, is the flaws in them. Between essays I fuss for a few days,\nlike a dog circling while it decides exactly where to lie down. But\nonce I get started on one, I don't have to push myself to work,\nbecause there's always some error or omission already pushing me.<br/><br/>I do make some amount of effort to focus on important topics. Many\nproblems have a hard core at the center, surrounded by easier stuff\nat the edges. Working hard means aiming toward the center to the\nextent you can. Some days you may not be able to; some days you'll\nonly be able to work on the easier, peripheral stuff. But you should\nalways be aiming as close to the center as you can without stalling.<br/><br/>The bigger question of what to do with your life is one of these\nproblems with a hard core. There are important problems at the\ncenter, which tend to be hard, and less important, easier ones at\nthe edges. So as well as the small, daily adjustments involved in\nworking on a specific problem, you'll occasionally have to make\nbig, lifetime-scale adjustments about which type of work to do.\nAnd the rule is the same: working hard means aiming toward the\ncenter — toward the most ambitious problems.<br/><br/>By center, though, I mean the actual center, not merely the current\nconsensus about the center. The consensus about which problems are\nmost important is often mistaken, both in general and within specific\nfields. If you disagree with it, and you're right, that could\nrepresent a valuable opportunity to do something new.<br/><br/>The more ambitious types of work will usually be harder, but although\nyou should not be in denial about this, neither should you treat\ndifficulty as an infallible guide in deciding what to do. If you\ndiscover some ambitious type of work that's a bargain in the sense\nof being easier for you than other people, either because of the\nabilities you happen to have, or because of some new way you've\nfound to approach it, or simply because you're more excited about\nit, by all means work on that. Some of the best work is done by\npeople who find an easy way to do something hard.<br/><br/>As well as learning the shape of real work, you need to figure out\nwhich kind you're suited for. And that doesn't just mean figuring\nout which kind your natural abilities match the best; it doesn't\nmean that if you're 7 feet tall, you have to play basketball. What\nyou're suited for depends not just on your talents but perhaps even\nmore on your interests. A <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/genius.html\"><u>deep interest</u></a> \nin a topic makes people\nwork harder than any amount of discipline can.<br/><br/>It can be harder to discover your interests than your talents.\nThere are fewer types of talent than interest, and they start to\nbe judged early in childhood, whereas interest in a topic is a\nsubtle thing that may not mature till your twenties, or even later.\nThe topic may not even exist earlier. Plus there are some powerful\nsources of error you need to learn to discount. Are you really\ninterested in x, or do you want to work on it because you'll make\na lot of money, or because other people will be impressed with you,\nor because your parents want you to?\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/hwh.html#f8n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">8</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The difficulty of figuring out what to work on varies enormously\nfrom one person to another. That's one of the most important things\nI've learned about work since I was a kid. As a kid, you get the\nimpression that everyone has a calling, and all they have to do is\nfigure out what it is. That's how it works in movies, and in the\nstreamlined biographies fed to kids. Sometimes it works that way\nin real life. Some people figure out what to do as children and\njust do it, like Mozart. But others, like Newton, turn restlessly\nfrom one kind of work to another. Maybe in retrospect we can identify\none as their calling — we can wish Newton spent more time on math\nand physics and less on alchemy and theology — but this is an\n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/disc.html\"><u>illusion</u></a> induced by hindsight bias. \nThere was no voice calling to him that he could have heard.<br/><br/>So while some people's lives converge fast, there will be others\nwhose lives never converge. And for these people, figuring out what\nto work on is not so much a prelude to working hard as an ongoing\npart of it, like one of a set of simultaneous equations. For these\npeople, the process I described earlier has a third component: along\nwith measuring both how hard you're working and how well you're\ndoing, you have to think about whether you should keep working in\nthis field or switch to another. If you're working hard but not\ngetting good enough results, you should switch. It sounds simple\nexpressed that way, but in practice it's very difficult. You shouldn't\ngive up on the first day just because you work hard and don't get\nanywhere. You need to give yourself time to get going. But how much\ntime? And what should you do if work that was going well stops going\nwell? How much time do you give yourself then?\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/hwh.html#f9n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">9</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>What even counts as good results? That can be really hard to decide.\nIf you're exploring an area few others have worked in, you may not\neven know what good results look like. History is full of examples\nof people who misjudged the importance of what they were working\non.<br/><br/>The best test of whether it's worthwhile to work on something is\nwhether you find it interesting. That may sound like a dangerously\nsubjective measure, but it's probably the most accurate one you're\ngoing to get. You're the one working on the stuff. Who's in a better\nposition than you to judge whether it's important, and what's a\nbetter predictor of its importance than whether it's interesting?<br/><br/>For this test to work, though, you have to be honest with yourself.\nIndeed, that's the most striking thing about the whole question of\nworking hard: how at each point it depends on being honest with\nyourself.<br/><br/>Working hard is not just a dial you turn up to 11. It's a complicated,\ndynamic system that has to be tuned just right at each point. You\nhave to understand the shape of real work, see clearly what kind\nyou're best suited for, aim as close to the true core of it as you\ncan, accurately judge at each moment both what you're capable of\nand how you're doing, and put in as many hours each day as you can\nwithout harming the quality of the result. This network is too\ncomplicated to trick. But if you're consistently honest and\nclear-sighted, it will automatically assume an optimal shape, and\nyou'll be productive in a way few people are.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nIn \"The Bus Ticket Theory of Genius\" I said the three ingredients\nin great work were natural ability, determination, and interest.\nThat's the formula in the preceding stage; determination and interest\nyield practice and effort.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nI mean this at a resolution of days, not hours. You'll often\nget somewhere while not working in the sense that the solution to\na problem comes to you while taking a \n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/top.html\"><u>shower</u></a>, or even in your sleep,\nbut only because you were working hard on it the day before.<br/><br/>It's good to go on vacation occasionally, but when I go on vacation,\nI like to learn new things. I wouldn't like just sitting on a beach.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nThe thing kids do in school that's most like the real version\nis sports. Admittedly because many sports originated as games played\nin schools. But in this one area, at least, kids are doing exactly\nwhat adults do.<br/><br/>In the average American high school, you have a choice of pretending\nto do something serious, or seriously doing something pretend.\nArguably the latter is no worse.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f4n\"><font color=\"#000000\">4</font></a>]\nKnowing what you want to work on doesn't mean you'll be able\nto. Most people have to spend a lot of their time working on things\nthey don't want to, especially early on. But if you know what you\nwant to do, you at least know what direction to nudge your life in.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f5n\"><font color=\"#000000\">5</font></a>]\nThe lower time limits for intense work suggest a solution to\nthe problem of having less time to work after you have kids: switch\nto harder problems. In effect I did that, though not deliberately.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f6n\"><font color=\"#000000\">6</font></a>]\nSome cultures have a tradition of performative hard work. I\ndon't love this idea, because (a) it makes a parody of something\nimportant and (b) it causes people to wear themselves out doing\nthings that don't matter. I don't know enough to say for sure whether\nit's net good or bad, but my guess is bad.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f7n\"><font color=\"#000000\">7</font></a>]\nOne of the reasons people work so hard on startups is that\nstartups can fail, and when they do, that failure tends to be both\ndecisive and conspicuous.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f8n\"><font color=\"#000000\">8</font></a>]\nIt's ok to work on something to make a lot of money. You need\nto solve the money problem somehow, and there's nothing wrong with\ndoing that efficiently by trying to make a lot at once. I suppose\nit would even be ok to be interested in money for its own sake;\nwhatever floats your boat. Just so long as you're conscious of your\nmotivations. The thing to avoid is <i>unconsciously</i> letting the need\nfor money warp your ideas about what kind of work you find most\ninteresting.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f9n\"><font color=\"#000000\">9</font></a>]\nMany people face this question on a smaller scale with\nindividual projects. But it's easier both to recognize and to accept\na dead end in a single project than to abandon some type of work\nentirely. The more determined you are, the harder it gets. Like a\nSpanish Flu victim, you're fighting your own immune system: Instead\nof giving up, you tell yourself, I should just try harder. And who\ncan say you're not right?<br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, John Carmack, John Collison, Patrick Collison,\nRobert Morris, Geoff Ralston, and Harj Taggar for reading drafts of this.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2021-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
