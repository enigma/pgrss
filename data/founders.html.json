In print they had to cut\nthe last item because they didn't have room.)</i><br/><br><b>1. Determination</b><br/><br/>This has turned out to be the most important quality in startup\nfounders.  We thought when we started Y Combinator that the most\nimportant quality would be intelligence.  That's the myth in the\nValley. And certainly you don't want founders to be stupid.  But\nas long as you're over a certain threshold of intelligence, what\nmatters most is determination.  You're going to hit a lot of\nobstacles.  You can't be the sort of person who gets <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/die.html\">demoralized</a>\neasily.<br/><br/>Bill Clerico and Rich Aberman of <a href=\"http://wepay.com\">WePay</a> \nare a good example.  They're\ndoing a finance startup, which means endless negotiations with big,\nbureaucratic companies.  When you're starting a startup that depends\non deals with big companies to exist, it often feels like they're\ntrying to ignore you out of existence.  But when Bill Clerico starts\ncalling you, you may as well do what he asks, because he is not\ngoing away.<br/><br/>\n<b>2. Flexibility</b><br/><br/>You do not however want the sort of determination implied by phrases\nlike \"don't give up on your dreams.\"  The world of startups is so\nunpredictable that you need to be able to modify your dreams on the\nfly.  The best metaphor I've found for the combination of determination\nand flexibility you need is a <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/relres.html\">running back</a>.  \nHe's determined to get\ndownfield, but at any given moment he may need to go sideways or\neven backwards to get there.<br/><br/>The current record holder for flexibility may be Daniel Gross of\n<a href=\"http://greplin.com\">Greplin</a>.  He applied to YC with \nsome bad ecommerce idea.  We told\nhim we'd fund him if he did something else.  He thought for a second,\nand said ok.  He then went through two more ideas before settling\non Greplin.  He'd only been working on it for a couple days when\nhe presented to investors at Demo Day, but he got a lot of interest.\nHe always seems to land on his feet.<br/><br/>\n<b>3. Imagination</b><br/><br/>Intelligence does matter a lot of course.  It seems like the type\nthat matters most is imagination.  It's not so important to be able\nto solve predefined problems quickly as to be able to come up with\nsurprising new ideas.  In the startup world, most good ideas \n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/googles.html\">seem\nbad</a> initially.  If they were obviously good, someone would already\nbe doing them.  So you need the kind of intelligence that produces\nideas with just the right level of craziness.<br/><br/><a href=\"http://airbnb.com\">Airbnb</a> is that kind of idea.  \nIn fact, when we funded Airbnb, we\nthought it was too crazy.  We couldn't believe large numbers of\npeople would want to stay in other people's places.  We funded them\nbecause we liked the founders so much.  As soon as we heard they'd\nbeen supporting themselves by selling Obama and McCain branded\nbreakfast cereal, they were in.  And it turned out the idea was on\nthe right side of crazy after all.<br/><br/>\n<b>4. Naughtiness</b><br/><br/>Though the most successful founders are usually good people, they\ntend to have a piratical gleam in their eye.  They're not Goody\nTwo-Shoes type good.  Morally, they care about getting the big\nquestions right, but not about observing proprieties.  That's why\nI'd use the word naughty rather than evil.  They delight in \n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/gba.html\">breaking\nrules</a>, but not rules that matter.  This quality may be redundant\nthough; it may be implied by imagination.<br/><br/>Sam Altman of <a href=\"http://loopt.com\">Loopt</a> \nis one of the most successful alumni, so we\nasked him what question we could put on the Y Combinator application\nthat would help us discover more people like him.  He said to ask\nabout a time when they'd hacked something to their advantageâ€”hacked in the sense of beating the system, not breaking into\ncomputers.  It has become one of the questions we pay most attention\nto when judging applications.<br/><br/>\n<b>5. Friendship</b><br/><br/>Empirically it seems to be hard to start a startup with just \n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html\">one\nfounder</a>.  Most of the big successes have two or three.  And the\nrelationship between the founders has to be strong.  They must\ngenuinely like one another, and work well together.  Startups do\nto the relationship between the founders what a dog does to a sock:\nif it can be pulled apart, it will be.<br/><br/>Emmett Shear and Justin Kan of <a href=\"http://justin.tv\">Justin.tv</a> \nare a good example of close\nfriends who work well together.  They've known each other since\nsecond grade.  They can practically read one another's minds.  I'm\nsure they argue, like all founders, but I have never once sensed\nany unresolved tension between them.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Jessica Livingston and Chris Steiner for reading drafts of this.<br/><br/></br></p></p></font>","date":"2010-10-01T00:00:00Z"}
