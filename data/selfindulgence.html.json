{"href":"selfindulgence.html","title":"How to Lose Time and Money","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">July 2010<br/><br/>When we sold our startup in 1998 I suddenly got a lot of money.  I\nnow had to think about something I hadn't had to think about before:\nhow not to lose it.   I knew it was possible to go from rich to\npoor, just as it was possible to go from poor to rich.  But while\nI'd spent a lot of the past several years studying the paths from\n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/wealth.html\">poor to rich</a>, \nI knew practically nothing about the paths from rich\nto poor.  Now, in order to avoid them, I had to learn where they\nwere.<br/><br/>So I started to pay attention to how fortunes are lost.  If you'd\nasked me as a kid how rich people became poor, I'd have said by\nspending all their money.  That's how it happens in books and movies,\nbecause that's the colorful way to do it.  But in fact the way most\nfortunes are lost is not through excessive expenditure, but through\nbad investments.<br/><br/>It's hard to spend a fortune without noticing.  Someone with ordinary\ntastes would find it hard to blow through more than a few tens of\nthousands of dollars without thinking \"wow, I'm spending a lot of\nmoney.\"  Whereas if you start trading derivatives, you can lose a\nmillion dollars (as much as you want, really) in the blink of an\neye.<br/><br/>In most people's minds, spending money on luxuries sets off alarms\nthat making investments doesn't.  Luxuries seem self-indulgent.\nAnd unless you got the money by inheriting it or winning a lottery,\nyou've already been thoroughly trained that self-indulgence leads\nto trouble.  Investing bypasses those alarms.  You're not spending\nthe money; you're just moving it from one asset to another.  Which\nis why people trying to sell you expensive things say \"it's an\ninvestment.\"<br/><br/>The solution is to develop new alarms.  This can be a tricky business,\nbecause while the alarms that prevent you from overspending are so\nbasic that they may even be in our DNA, the ones that prevent you\nfrom making bad investments have to be learned, and are sometimes\nfairly counterintuitive.<br/><br/>A few days ago I realized something surprising: the situation with\ntime is much the same as with money.  The most dangerous way to\nlose time is not to spend it having fun, but to spend it doing fake\nwork.  When you spend time having fun, you know you're being\nself-indulgent.  Alarms start to go off fairly quickly.  If I woke\nup one morning and sat down on the sofa and watched TV all day, I'd\nfeel like something was terribly wrong.  Just thinking about it\nmakes me wince.  I'd start to feel uncomfortable after sitting on\na sofa watching TV for 2 hours, let alone a whole day.<br/><br/>And yet I've definitely had days when I might as well have sat in\nfront of a TV all day â€” days at the end of which, if I asked myself\nwhat I got done that day, the answer would have been: basically,\nnothing.  I feel bad after these days too, but nothing like as bad\nas I'd feel if I spent the whole day on the sofa watching TV.  If\nI spent a whole day watching TV I'd feel like I was descending into\nperdition.  But the same alarms don't go off on the days when I get\nnothing done, because I'm doing stuff that seems, superficially,\nlike real work.  Dealing with email, for example.  You do it sitting\nat a desk.  It's not fun.  So it must be work.<br/><br/>With time, as with money, avoiding pleasure is no longer enough to\nprotect you.  It probably was enough to protect hunter-gatherers,\nand perhaps all pre-industrial societies.  So nature and nurture\ncombine to make us avoid self-indulgence. But the world has gotten\nmore complicated: the most dangerous traps now are new behaviors\nthat bypass our alarms about self-indulgence by mimicking more\nvirtuous types.  And the worst thing is, they're not even fun.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison, Jessica\nLivingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
