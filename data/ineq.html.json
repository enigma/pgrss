And in particular, the rich have gotten a lot richer.\nNearly everyone who writes about the topic says that economic inequality\nshould be decreased.<br/><br/>I'm interested in this question because I was one of the founders of\na company called Y Combinator that helps people start startups.\nAlmost by definition, if a startup succeeds, its founders become\nrich. Which means by helping startup founders I've been helping to\nincrease economic inequality.  If economic inequality should be \ndecreased, I shouldn't be helping founders. No one should\nbe.<br/><br/>But that doesn't sound right. What's going on here? What's going\non is that while economic inequality is a single measure (or more\nprecisely, two: variation in income, and variation in wealth), it\nhas multiple causes. Many of these causes are bad, like tax loopholes\nand drug addiction. But some are good, like Larry Page and\nSergey Brin starting the company you use to find things online.<br/><br/>If you want to understand economic inequality — and more importantly,\nif you actually want to fix the bad aspects of it — you have to\ntease apart the components.  And yet the trend in nearly everything\nwritten about the subject is to do the opposite: to squash together\nall the aspects of economic inequality as if it were a single\nphenomenon.<br/><br/>Sometimes this is done for ideological reasons.  Sometimes it's\nbecause the writer only has very high-level data and so draws\nconclusions from that, like the proverbial drunk who looks for his\nkeys under the lamppost, instead of where he dropped them, because the\nlight is better there.  Sometimes it's because the writer doesn't\nunderstand critical aspects of inequality, like the role of technology\nin wealth creation.  Much of the time, perhaps most of the time,\nwriting about economic inequality combines all three.<br/><br/><center>___</center><br/><br/>The most common mistake people make about economic inequality is\nto treat it as a single phenomenon.  The most naive version of which\nis the one based on the pie fallacy: that the rich get rich by\ntaking money from the poor.<br/><br/>Usually this is an assumption people start from rather than a\nconclusion they arrive at by examining the evidence.  Sometimes the\npie fallacy is stated explicitly:\n<blockquote>\n  ...those at the top are grabbing an increasing fraction of the\n  nation's income — so much of a larger share that what's left over\n  for the rest is diminished....\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/ineq.html#f1n\"><font color=\"#999999\">1</font></a>]</font>\n</blockquote>\nOther times it's more unconscious. But the unconscious form is very\nwidespread.  I think because we grow up in a world where the pie\nfallacy is actually true.  To kids, wealth <i>is</i> a fixed pie\nthat's shared out, and if one person gets more, it's at the expense\nof another.  It takes a conscious effort to remind oneself that the\nreal world doesn't work that way.<br/><br/>In the real world you can create wealth as well as taking it from\nothers.  A woodworker creates wealth.  He makes a chair, and you\nwillingly give him money in return for it.  A high-frequency trader\ndoes not.  He makes a dollar only when someone on the other end of\na trade loses a dollar.<br/><br/>If the rich people in a society got that way by taking wealth from\nthe poor, then you have the degenerate case of economic inequality,\nwhere the cause of poverty is the same as the cause of wealth.  But\ninstances of inequality don't have to be instances of the degenerate\ncase.  If one woodworker makes 5 chairs and another makes none, the\nsecond woodworker will have less money, but not because anyone took\nanything from him.<br/><br/>Even people sophisticated enough to know about the pie fallacy are\nled toward it by the custom of describing economic inequality as a\nratio of one quantile's income or wealth to another's.  It's so\neasy to slip from talking about income shifting from one quantile\nto another, as a figure of speech, into believing that is literally\nwhat's happening.<br/><br/>Except in the degenerate case, economic inequality can't be described\nby a ratio or even a curve.  In the general case it consists of\nmultiple ways people become poor, and multiple ways people become\nrich.  Which means to understand economic inequality in a country,\nyou have to go find individual people who are poor or rich and\nfigure out why.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/ineq.html#f2n\"><font color=\"#999999\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>If you want to understand <i>change</i> in economic inequality, you\nshould ask what those people would have done when it was different.\nThis is one way I know the rich aren't all getting richer simply\nfrom some new system for transferring wealth to them from\neveryone else.  When you use the would-have method with startup\nfounders, you find what most would have done \n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/re.html\"><u>back in 1960</u></a>, when\neconomic inequality was lower, was to join big companies or become\nprofessors.  Before Mark Zuckerberg started Facebook, his default\nexpectation was that he'd end up working at Microsoft.  The reason\nhe and most other startup founders are richer than they would have\nbeen in the mid 20th century is not because of some right turn the\ncountry took during the Reagan administration, but because progress\nin technology has made it much easier to start a new company that\n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/growth.html\"><u>grows fast</u></a>.<br/><br/>Traditional economists seem strangely averse to studying individual\nhumans. It seems to be a rule with them that everything has to start\nwith statistics.  So they give you very precise numbers about\nvariation in wealth and income, then follow it with the most naive\nspeculation about the underlying causes.<br/><br/>But while there are a lot of people who get rich through rent-seeking\nof various forms, and a lot who get rich by playing zero-sum games, \nthere are also a significant number\nwho get rich by creating wealth.  And creating wealth, as a source\nof economic inequality, is different from taking it — not just\nmorally, but also practically, in the sense that it is harder to\neradicate.  One reason is that variation in productivity is\naccelerating.  The rate at which individuals can create wealth\ndepends on the technology available to them, and that grows\nexponentially. The other reason creating wealth is such a tenacious\nsource of inequality is that it can expand to accommodate a lot of\npeople.<br/><br/><center>___</center><br/><br/>I'm all for shutting down the crooked ways to get rich.  But that\nwon't eliminate great variations in wealth, because as long as you leave\nopen the option of getting rich by creating wealth, people who want\nto get rich will do that instead.<br/><br/>Most people who get rich tend to be fairly driven. Whatever their\nother flaws, laziness is usually not one of them.  Suppose new\npolicies make it hard to make a fortune in finance. Does it seem\nplausible that the people who currently go into finance to make\ntheir fortunes will continue to do so, but be content to work for\nordinary salaries? The reason they go into finance is not because\nthey love finance but because they want to get rich. If the only\nway left to get rich is to start startups, they'll start startups.\nThey'll do well at it too, because determination is the main factor\nin the success of a startup. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/ineq.html#f3n\"><font color=\"#999999\">3</font></a>]</font>\nAnd while it would probably be\na good thing for the world if people who wanted to get rich switched\nfrom playing zero-sum games to creating wealth, that would not only\nnot eliminate great variations in wealth, but might even \nexacerbate them.\nIn a zero-sum game there is at least a limit to the upside.  Plus\na lot of the new startups would create new technology that further\naccelerated variation in productivity.<br/><br/>Variation in productivity is far from the only source of economic\ninequality, but it is the irreducible core of it, in the sense that\nyou'll have that left when you eliminate all other sources. And if\nyou do, that core will be big, because it will have expanded to\ninclude the efforts of all the refugees.  Plus it will have a large\nBaumol penumbra around it: anyone who could get rich by creating\nwealth on their own account will have to be paid enough to prevent\nthem from doing it.<br/><br/>You can't prevent great variations in wealth without preventing people\nfrom getting rich, and you can't do that without preventing them\nfrom starting startups.<br/><br/>So let's be clear about that. Eliminating great variations in wealth would\nmean eliminating startups.  And that doesn't seem a wise move.\nEspecially since it would only mean you eliminated\nstartups in your own country.  Ambitious people already move halfway\naround the world to further their careers, and startups can operate\nfrom anywhere nowadays.  So if you made it impossible to get rich\nby creating wealth in your country, people who wanted to do that\nwould just leave and do it somewhere else. Which would\ncertainly get you a lower Gini coefficient, along with a lesson in\nbeing careful what you ask for. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/ineq.html#f4n\"><font color=\"#999999\">4</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>I think rising economic inequality is the inevitable fate of countries\nthat don't choose something worse. We had a 40 year stretch in the\nmiddle of the 20th century that convinced some people otherwise.\nBut as I explained in <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/re.html\"><u>The Refragmentation</u></a>,\nthat was an anomaly — a\nunique combination of circumstances that compressed American society\nnot just economically but culturally too.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/ineq.html#f5n\"><font color=\"#999999\">5</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>And while some of the growth in economic inequality we've seen since\nthen has been due to bad behavior of various kinds, there has\nsimultaneously been a huge increase in individuals' ability to\ncreate wealth.  Startups are almost entirely a product of this\nperiod. And even within the startup world, there has been a qualitative\nchange in the last 10 years.  Technology has decreased the cost of\nstarting a startup so much that founders now have the upper hand\nover investors.  Founders get less diluted, and it is now common\nfor them to retain \n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/control.html\"><u>board control</u></a> as well.  Both further increase\neconomic inequality, the former because founders own more stock,\nand the latter because, as investors have learned, founders tend\nto be better at running their companies than investors.<br/><br/>While the surface manifestations change, the underlying forces are\nvery, very old.  The acceleration of productivity we see in Silicon\nValley has been happening for thousands of years.  If you look at\nthe history of stone tools, technology was already accelerating in\nthe Mesolithic.  The acceleration would have been too slow to\nperceive in one lifetime.  Such is the nature of the leftmost part\nof an exponential curve.  But it was the same curve.<br/><br/>You do not want to design your society in a way that's incompatible\nwith this curve. The evolution of technology is one of the most\npowerful forces in history.<br/><br/>Louis Brandeis said \"We may have democracy, or we may have wealth\nconcentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have both.\" That\nsounds plausible.  But if I have to choose between ignoring him and\nignoring an exponential curve that has been operating for thousands\nof years, I'll bet on the curve.  Ignoring any trend that has been\noperating for thousands of years is dangerous.  But exponential\ngrowth, especially, tends to bite you.<br/><br/><center>___</center><br/><br/>If accelerating variation in productivity is always going to produce\nsome baseline growth in economic inequality, it would be a good\nidea to spend some time thinking about that future.  Can you have\na healthy society with great variation in wealth?  What would it\nlook like?<br/><br/>Notice how novel it feels to think about that.  The public conversation\nso far has been exclusively about the need to decrease economic\ninequality.  We've barely given a thought to how to live with it.<br/><br/>I'm hopeful we'll be able to.  Brandeis was a product of the Gilded\nAge, and things have changed since then. It's harder to hide\nwrongdoing now.  And to get rich now you don't have to buy politicians\nthe way railroad or oil magnates did. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/ineq.html#f6n\"><font color=\"#999999\">6</font></a>]</font>\nThe great concentrations\nof wealth I see around me in Silicon Valley don't seem to be\ndestroying democracy.<br/><br/>There are lots of things wrong with the US that have economic\ninequality as a symptom. We should fix those things.  In the process\nwe may decrease economic inequality. But we can't start from the\nsymptom and hope to fix the underlying causes.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/ineq.html#f7n\"><font color=\"#999999\">7</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The most obvious is poverty. I'm sure most of those who want to\ndecrease economic inequality want to do it mainly to help the poor,\nnot to hurt the rich. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/ineq.html#f8n\"><font color=\"#999999\">8</font></a>]</font>\nIndeed, a good number are merely being\nsloppy by speaking of decreasing economic inequality when what they\nmean is decreasing poverty.  But this is a situation where it would\nbe good to be precise about what we want.  Poverty and economic\ninequality are not identical.  When the city is turning off your\n<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/07/what-happens-when-detroit-shuts-off-the-water-of-100000-people/374548/\"><u>water</u></a>\nbecause you can't pay the bill, it doesn't make any difference\nwhat Larry Page's net worth is compared to yours.  He might only\nbe a few times richer than you, and it would still be just as much\nof a problem that your water was getting turned off.<br/><br/>Closely related to poverty is lack of social mobility.  I've seen\nthis myself: you don't have to grow up rich or even upper middle\nclass to get rich as a startup founder, but few successful founders\ngrew up desperately poor.  But again, the problem here is not simply\neconomic inequality.  There is an enormous difference in wealth\nbetween the household Larry Page grew up in and that of a successful\nstartup founder, but that didn't prevent him from joining their\nranks.  It's not economic inequality per se that's blocking social\nmobility, but some specific combination of things that go wrong\nwhen kids grow up sufficiently poor.<br/><br/>One of the most important principles in Silicon Valley is that \"you\nmake what you measure.\"  It means that if you pick some number to\nfocus on, it will tend to improve, but that you have to choose the\nright number, because only the one you choose will improve; another\nthat seems conceptually adjacent might not.  For example, if you're\na university president and you decide to focus on graduation rates,\nthen you'll improve graduation rates.  But only graduation rates,\nnot how much students learn.  Students could learn less, if to\nimprove graduation rates you made classes easier.<br/><br/>Economic inequality is sufficiently far from identical with the\nvarious problems that have it as a symptom that we'll probably only\nhit whichever of the two we aim at.  If we aim at economic inequality,\nwe won't fix these problems.  So I say let's aim at the problems.<br/><br/>For example, let's attack poverty, and if necessary damage wealth\nin the process. That's much more likely to work than attacking\nwealth in the hope that you will thereby fix poverty.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/ineq.html#f9n\"><font color=\"#999999\">9</font></a>]</font>\nAnd if\nthere are people getting rich by tricking consumers or lobbying the\ngovernment for anti-competitive regulations or tax loopholes, then\nlet's stop them. Not because it's causing economic inequality, but\nbecause it's stealing.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/ineq.html#f10n\"><font color=\"#999999\">10</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>If all you have is statistics, it seems like that's what you need\nto fix. But behind a broad statistical measure like economic\ninequality there are some things that are good and some that are\nbad, some that are historical trends with immense momentum and\nothers that are random accidents.  If we want to fix the world\nbehind the statistics, we have to understand it, and focus our\nefforts where they'll do the most good.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nStiglitz, Joseph. <i>The Price of Inequality</i>. Norton, 2012. p.\n32.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nParticularly since economic inequality is a matter of outliers,\nand outliers are disproportionately likely to have gotten where\nthey are by ways that have little do with the sort of things\neconomists usually think about, like wages and productivity, but\nrather by, say, ending up on the wrong side of the \"War on Drugs.\"<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nDetermination is the most important factor in deciding between\nsuccess and failure, which in startups tend to be sharply differentiated.\nBut it takes more than determination to create one of the hugely\nsuccessful startups.  Though most founders start out excited about\nthe idea of getting rich, purely mercenary founders will usually\ntake one of the big acquisition offers most successful startups get\non the way up.  The founders who go on to the next stage tend to\nbe driven by a sense of mission.  They have the same attachment to\ntheir companies that an artist or writer has to their work.  But\nit is very hard to predict at the outset which founders will do\nthat. It's not simply a function of their initial attitude.  Starting\na company changes people.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f4n\"><font color=\"#000000\">4</font></a>]\nAfter reading a draft of this essay, Richard Florida told me\nhow he had once talked to a group of Europeans \"who said\n they wanted to make Europe more entrepreneurial and more\n  like Silicon Valley. I said by definition this will give you more\n  inequality.  They thought I was insane — they could not process\n  it.\"<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f5n\"><font color=\"#000000\">5</font></a>]\nEconomic inequality has been decreasing globally.  But this\nis mainly due to the erosion of the kleptocracies that formerly\ndominated all the poorer countries.  Once the playing field is\nleveler politically, we'll see economic inequality start to rise\nagain. The US is the bellwether.  The situation we face here, the\nrest of the world will sooner or later.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f6n\"><font color=\"#000000\">6</font></a>]\nSome people still get rich by buying politicians.  My point is that\nit's no longer a precondition.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f7n\"><font color=\"#000000\">7</font></a>]\nAs well as problems that have economic inequality as a symptom,\nthere are those that have it as a cause.  But in most if not all,\neconomic inequality is not the primary cause.  There is usually\nsome injustice that is allowing economic inequality to turn into\nother forms of inequality, and that injustice is what we need to\nfix.  For example, the police in the US treat the poor worse than\nthe rich.  But the solution is not to make people richer. It's to\nmake the police treat people more equitably.  Otherwise they'll\ncontinue to maltreat people who are weak in other ways.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f8n\"><font color=\"#000000\">8</font></a>]\nSome who read this essay will say that I'm clueless or even\nbeing deliberately misleading by focusing so much on the richer end\nof economic inequality — that economic inequality is really about\npoverty. But that is exactly the point I'm making, though sloppier\nlanguage than I'd use to make it.  The real problem is poverty, not\neconomic inequality.  And if you conflate them you're aiming at the\nwrong target.<br/><br/>Others will say I'm clueless or being misleading by focusing on\npeople who get rich by creating wealth — that startups aren't the\nproblem, but corrupt practices in finance, healthcare, and so on.\nOnce again, that is exactly my point.  The problem is not economic\ninequality, but those specific abuses.<br/><br/>It's a strange task to write an essay about why something isn't the\nproblem, but that's the situation you find yourself in when so many\npeople mistakenly think it is.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f9n\"><font color=\"#000000\">9</font></a>]\nParticularly since many causes of poverty are only partially\ndriven by people trying to make money from them. For example,\nAmerica's abnormally high incarceration rate is a major cause of\npoverty.  But although <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/04/28/how-for-profit-prisons-have-become-the-biggest-lobby-no-one-is-talking-about/\"><u>for-profit prison companies</u></a> and \n<a href=\"http://mic.com/articles/41531/union-of-the-snake-how-california-s-prison-guards-subvert-democracy\"><u>prison guard unions</u></a> both spend \na lot lobbying for harsh sentencing laws, they\nare not the original source of them.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f10n\"><font color=\"#000000\">10</font></a>]\nIncidentally, tax loopholes are definitely not a product\nof some power shift due to recent increases in economic inequality.\nThe golden age of economic equality in the mid 20th century was\nalso the golden age of tax avoidance. Indeed, it was so widespread\nand so effective that I'm skeptical whether economic inequality was\nreally so low then as we think.  In a period when people are trying\nto hide wealth from the government, it will tend to be hidden from\nstatistics too. One sign of the potential magnitude of the problem\nis the discrepancy between government receipts as a percentage of\nGDP, which have remained more or less constant during the entire\nperiod from the end of World War II to the present, and tax rates,\nwhich have varied dramatically.<br/><br/>\n<b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Tiffani Ashley Bell, Patrick Collison, Ron\nConway, Richard Florida, Ben Horowitz, Jessica Livingston, Robert\nMorris, Tim O'Reilly, Max Roser, and Alexia Tsotsis for reading\ndrafts of this.<br/><br/><b>Note:</b> This is a new version from which I\nremoved a pair of metaphors that made a lot of people mad, \nessentially by macroexpanding them.
