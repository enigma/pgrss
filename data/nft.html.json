{"href":"nft.html","title":"An NFT That Saves Lives","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">May 2021<br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.noorahealth.org/\">Noora Health</a>, a nonprofit I've \nsupported for years, just launched\na new NFT. It has a dramatic name, <a href=\"http://bit.ly/NooraNFT\"><u>Save Thousands of Lives</u></a>,\nbecause that's what the proceeds will do.<br/><br/>Noora has been saving lives for 7 years. They run programs in\nhospitals in South Asia to teach new mothers how to take care of\ntheir babies once they get home. They're in 165 hospitals now. And\nbecause they know the numbers before and after they start at a new\nhospital, they can measure the impact they have. It is massive.\nFor every 1000 live births, they save 9 babies.<br/><br/>This number comes from a <a href=\"http://bit.ly/NFT-research\"><u>study</u></a>\nof 133,733 families at 28 different\nhospitals that Noora conducted in collaboration with the Better\nBirth team at Ariadne Labs, a joint center for health systems\ninnovation at Brigham and Womenï¿½s Hospital and Harvard T.H. Chan\nSchool of Public Health.<br/><br/>Noora is so effective that even if you measure their costs in the\nmost conservative way, by dividing their entire budget by the number\nof lives saved, the cost of saving a life is the lowest I've seen.\n$1,235.<br/><br/>For this NFT, they're going to issue a public report tracking how\nthis specific tranche of money is spent, and estimating the number\nof lives saved as a result.<br/><br/>NFTs are a new territory, and this way of using them is especially\nnew, but I'm excited about its potential. And I'm excited to see\nwhat happens with this particular auction, because unlike an NFT\nrepresenting something that has already happened,\nthis NFT gets better as the price gets higher.<br/><br/>The reserve price was about $2.5 million, because that's what it\ntakes for the name to be accurate: that's what it costs to save\n2000 lives. But the higher the price of this NFT goes, the more\nlives will be saved. What a sentence to be able to write.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2021-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
