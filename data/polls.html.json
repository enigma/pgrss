{"href":"polls.html","title":"Bradley's Ghost","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">November 2004<br/><br/><!--<i>(I wrote this essay immediately after the election.\nBut after writing it I buried it; I was so\ndepressed about the election that I just didn't want to think\nabout it anymore.\nI recently came across this essay again, and it\nstrikes me as on the mark.)</i>\n-->\nA lot of people are writing now about \nwhy Kerry lost.  Here I want to\nexamine a more specific question: why were the exit polls so \nwrong?<br/><br/>In Ohio, which Kerry ultimately\nlost 49-51, exit polls gave him a 52-48 victory.  And this wasn't just\nrandom error.  In every swing state they overestimated the Kerry vote.\nIn Florida, which Bush ultimately won 52-47, exit polls predicted\na dead heat.<br/><br/>(These are not early numbers. They're from about midnight eastern time, \nlong after polls closed in Ohio and Florida.  And yet by the\nnext afternoon the exit poll numbers online corresponded to the returns.  \nThe only way I can imagine this happening is if those in\ncharge of the exit polls cooked the books after seeing the actual\nreturns.  But that's another issue.)<br/><br/>What happened?  The source of the problem may be a variant of\nthe Bradley Effect.  \nThis term\nwas invented after Tom Bradley, the black mayor of Los Angeles, \nlost an election for governor of California despite a comfortable\nlead in the polls.  Apparently voters were afraid to say  \nthey planned to vote against him, lest their motives be\n(perhaps correctly) suspected.<br/><br/>It seems likely that something similar happened in exit polls this year.\nIn theory, exit polls ought to be very accurate.  \nYou're not asking people what they would do.  You're\nasking what they just did.<br/><br/>How can you get errors asking that?  Because some people don't\nrespond.  To get a truly random sample, pollsters ask, say, every\n20th person leaving the polling place who they voted for.  But not\neveryone wants to answer.  And the pollsters can't simply ignore\nthose who won't, or their sample isn't random anymore.  So what\nthey do, apparently, is note down the age and race and sex of the\nperson, and guess from that who they voted for.<br/><br/>This works so long as there is no <i>correlation</i> between who people\nvote for and whether they're willing to talk about it.  But this\nyear there may have been.  It may be that a significant number of \nthose who voted for\nBush didn't want to say so.<br/><br/>Why not?  Because people in the US are more conservative than they're\nwilling to admit.  The values of the elite in this country, at least\nat the moment, are NPR values.  The average person, as I think both\nRepublicans and Democrats would agree, is more socially conservative.  \nBut while some openly flaunt the fact that they don't share the\nopinions of the elite, others feel a little nervous about it, as \nif they had bad table manners.<br/><br/>For example, according to current NPR values, you \n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/say.html\">can't say</a> anything that might be \nperceived as disparaging towards homosexuals.  To do  \nso is \"homophobic.\"  And yet a large number of Americans are deeply\nreligious, and the Bible is quite explicit on the subject of\nhomosexuality.  What are they to do?  I think what many do is keep \ntheir opinions, but keep them to themselves.<br/><br/>They know what they believe, but they also know what they're supposed\nto believe.\nAnd so when a stranger (for example, a pollster) asks\nthem their opinion about something like gay marriage, they will not\nalways say what they really think.<br/><br/>When the values of the elite are liberal, polls will tend to\nunderestimate the conservativeness of ordinary voters.  This seems\nto me the leading theory to explain why the exit polls were so \nfar off this year.  NPR values   \nsaid one ought to vote for Kerry.  So all the people who voted for\nKerry felt virtuous for doing so, and were eager to tell pollsters\nthey had. No one who voted for Kerry did it as an act of quiet\ndefiance.<br/><br/><!-- Imagine this scenario.  A husband and wife go to vote.  The wife\nthinks Bush has made a mess in Iraq and that the family is worse   \noff economically than a few years ago, and plans to vote for Kerry.\nThe husband thinks it's\ngreat that America is finally kicking some ass, and sees in George\nBush a kind of cowboy figure that he likes to identify with.  Which\nof the two is more likely to want to explain to a pollster why they\nvoted as they did?<br /><br />--><br/><br/><br clear=\"all\"/></font>","date":"2004-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
