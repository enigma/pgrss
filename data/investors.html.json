April 2007, September 2010<br><br/>In a few days it will be Demo Day, when the startups we funded\nthis summer present to investors.  Y Combinator funds startups twice\na year, in January and June.  Ten weeks later we invite all the\ninvestors we know to hear them present what they've built so far.<br/><br/>Ten weeks is not much time.  The average startup probably doesn't\nhave much to show for itself after ten weeks.  But the average\nstartup fails.  When you look at the ones that went on to do great\nthings, you find a lot that began with someone pounding out a\nprototype in a week or two of nonstop work.  Startups are a\ncounterexample to the rule that haste makes waste.<br/><br/>(Too much money seems to be as bad for startups as too much time,\nso we don't give them much money either.)<br/><br/>A week before Demo Day, we have a dress rehearsal called Rehearsal Day.\nAt other Y Combinator events we allow outside guests, but not at\nRehearsal Day.  No one except the other founders gets to see the rehearsals.<br/><br/>The presentations on Rehearsal Day are often pretty rough.  But this is\nto be expected.  We try to pick founders who are good at building\nthings, not ones who are slick presenters.  Some of the founders\nare just out of college, or even still in it, and have never spoken\nto a group of people they didn't already know.<br/><br/>So we concentrate on the basics.  On Demo Day each startup will\nonly get ten minutes, so we encourage them to focus on just two\ngoals: (a) explain what you're doing, and (b) explain why users\nwill want it.<br/><br/>That might sound easy, but it's not when the speakers have no\nexperience presenting, and they're explaining technical matters to\nan audience that's mostly non-technical.<br/><br/>This situation is constantly repeated when startups present to\ninvestors: people who are bad at explaining, talking to people who\nare bad at understanding.  Practically every successful startup,\nincluding stars like Google, presented at some point to investors\nwho didn't get it and turned them down.  Was it because the founders\nwere bad at presenting, or because the investors were obtuse?  It's\nprobably always some of both.<br/><br/>At the most recent Rehearsal Day, we four Y Combinator partners found\nourselves saying a lot of the same things we said at the last two.\nSo at dinner afterward we collected all our tips about presenting\nto investors.  Most startups face similar challenges, so we hope\nthese will be useful to a wider audience.<br/><br/>\n<b>1. Explain what you're doing.</b><br/><br/>Investors' main question when judging a very early startup is whether\nyou've made a compelling product.  Before they can judge whether\nyou've built a good x, they have to understand what kind of x you've\nbuilt.  They will get very frustrated if instead of telling them\nwhat you do, you make them sit through some kind of preamble.<br/><br/>Say what you're doing as soon as possible, preferably in the first\nsentence. \"We're Jeff and Bob and we've built an easy to use web-based\ndatabase.  Now we'll show it to you and explain why people need\nthis.\"<br/><br/>If you're a great public speaker you may be able to violate this\nrule.  Last year one founder spent the whole first half of his talk\non a fascinating analysis of the limits of the conventional desktop\nmetaphor.  He got away with it, but unless you're a captivating\nspeaker, which most hackers aren't, it's better to play it safe.<br/><br/><b>2. Get rapidly to demo.</b><br/><br/><i>This section is now obsolete for YC founders presenting\nat Demo Day, because Demo Day presentations are now so short\nthat they rarely include much if any demo.  They seem to work\njust as well without, however, which makes me think I was\nwrong to emphasize demos so much before.</i><br/><br/>A demo explains what you've made more effectively than any verbal\ndescription.  The only thing worth talking about first is the problem\nyou're trying to solve and why it's important.  But don't spend\nmore than a tenth of your time on that.  Then demo.<br/><br/>When you demo, don't run through a catalog of features.  Instead\nstart with the problem you're solving, and then show how your product\nsolves it.  Show features in an order driven by some kind of purpose,\nrather than the order in which they happen to appear on the screen.<br/><br/>If you're demoing something web-based, assume that the network\nconnection will mysteriously die 30 seconds into your presentation,\nand come prepared with a copy of the server software running on\nyour laptop.<br/><br/><b>3. Better a narrow description than a vague one.</b><br/><br/>One reason founders resist describing their projects concisely is\nthat, at this early stage, there are all kinds of possibilities.\nThe most concise descriptions seem misleadingly narrow.  So for\nexample a group that has built an easy web-based database might\nresist calling their applicaton that, because it could be so much\nmore.  In fact, it could be anything...<br/><br/>The problem is, as you approach (in the calculus sense) a description\nof something that could be anything, the content of your description\napproaches zero.  If you describe your web-based database as \"a\nsystem to allow people to collaboratively leverage the value of\ninformation,\" it will go in one investor ear and out the other.\nThey'll just discard that sentence as meaningless boilerplate, and\nhope, with increasing impatience, that in the next sentence you'll\nactually explain what you've made.<br/><br/>Your primary goal is not to describe everything your system might\none day become, but simply to convince investors you're worth talking\nto further.  So approach this like an algorithm that gets the right\nanswer by successive approximations.  Begin with a description\nthat's gripping but perhaps overly narrow, then flesh it out to the\nextent you can.  It's the same principle as incremental development:\nstart with a simple prototype, then add features, but at every point\nhave working code.  In this case, \"working code\" means a working\ndescription in the investor's head.<br/><br/><b>4. Don't talk and drive.</b><br/><br/>Have one person talk while another uses the computer.  If the same\nperson does both, they'll inevitably mumble downwards at the computer\nscreen instead of talking clearly at the audience.<br/><br/>As long as you're standing near the audience and looking at them,\npoliteness (and habit) compel them to pay attention to you.  Once\nyou stop looking at them to fuss with something on your computer,\ntheir minds drift off to the errands they have to run later.<br/><br/><b>5. Don't talk about secondary matters at length.</b><br/><br/>If you only have a few minutes, spend them explaining what your\nproduct does and why it's great.  Second order issues like competitors\nor resumes should be single slides you go through quickly at the\nend.  If you have impressive resumes, just flash them on the screen\nfor 15 seconds and say a few words.  For competitors, list the top\n3 and explain in one sentence each what they lack\nthat you have.  And put this kind of thing at the end, after you've\nmade it clear what you've built.<br/><br/><b>6. Don't get too deeply into business models.</b><br/><br/>It's good to talk about how you plan to make money, but mainly\nbecause it shows you care about that and have thought about it.\nDon't go into detail about your business model, because (a) that's\nnot what smart investors care about in a brief presentation, and\n(b) any business model you have at this point is probably wrong\nanyway.<br/><br/>Recently a VC who came to speak at Y Combinator talked about a\ncompany he just invested in.  He said their business model was wrong\nand would probably change three times before they got it right.\nThe founders were experienced guys who'd done startups before and\nwho'd just succeeded in getting millions from one of the top VC\nfirms, and even their business model was crap.  (And yet he invested\nanyway, because he expected it to be crap at this stage.)<br/><br/>If you're solving an important problem, you're going to sound a lot\nsmarter talking about that than the business model.  The business\nmodel is just a bunch of guesses, and guesses about stuff that's\nprobably not your area of expertise.  So don't spend your precious\nfew minutes talking about crap when you could be talking about\nsolid, interesting things you know a lot about: the problem you're\nsolving and what you've built so far.<br/><br/>As well as being a bad use of time, if your business model seems\nspectacularly wrong, that will push the stuff you want investors\nto remember out of their heads.  They'll just remember you as the\ncompany with the boneheaded plan for making money, rather than the\ncompany that solved that important problem.<br/><br/><b>7. Talk slowly and clearly at the audience.</b><br/><br/>Everyone at Rehearsal Day could see the difference between the people\nwho'd been out in the world for a while and had presented to groups,\nand those who hadn't.<br/><br/>You need to use a completely different voice and manner talking to\na roomful of people than you would in conversation.  Everyday life\ngives you no practice in this.  If you can't already do it, the\nbest solution is to treat it as a consciously artificial trick,\nlike juggling.<br/><br/>However, that doesn't mean you should talk like some kind of\nannouncer.  Audiences tune that out.  What you need to do is talk\nin this artificial way, and yet make it seem conversational.  (Writing\nis the same.  Good writing is an elaborate effort to seem spontaneous.)<br/><br/>If you want to write out your whole presentation beforehand and\nmemorize it, that's ok.  That has worked for some groups in the\npast.  But make sure to write something that sounds like spontaneous,\ninformal speech, and deliver it that way too.<br/><br/>Err on the side of speaking slowly.  At Rehearsal Day, one of the founders\nmentioned a rule actors use: if you feel you're speaking too slowly,\nyou're speaking at about the right speed.<br/><br/><b>8. Have one person talk.</b><br/><br/>Startups often want to show that all the founders are equal partners.\nThis is a good instinct; investors dislike unbalanced teams.  But\ntrying to show it by partitioning the presentation is going too\nfar.  It's distracting.  You can demonstrate your respect\nfor one another in more subtle ways.  For example, when one of the\ngroups presented at Demo Day, the more extroverted of the two\nfounders did most of the talking, but he described his co-founder\nas the best hacker he'd ever met, and you could tell he meant it.<br/><br/>Pick the one or at most two best speakers, and have them do most\nof the talking.<br/><br/>Exception: If one of the founders is an expert in some specific\ntechnical field, it can be good for them to talk about that for a\nminute or so.  This kind of \"expert witness\" can add credibility,\neven if the audience doesn't understand all the details.  If Jobs\nand Wozniak had 10 minutes to present the Apple II, it might be a good plan\nto have Jobs speak for 9 minutes and have Woz speak for a minute\nin the middle about some of the technical feats he'd pulled off in\nthe design.  (Though of course if it were actually those two, Jobs\nwould speak for the entire 10 minutes.)<br/><br/><b>9. Seem confident.</b><br/><br/>Between the brief time available and their lack of technical\nbackground, many in the audience will have a hard time evaluating\nwhat you're doing.  Probably the single biggest piece of evidence,\ninitially, will be your own confidence in it.   You have\nto show you're impressed with what you've made.<br/><br/>And I mean show, not tell.  Never say \"we're passionate\" or \"our\nproduct is great.\"  People just ignore that—or worse, write you\noff as bullshitters.  Such messages must be implicit.<br/><br/>What you must not do is seem nervous and apologetic.  If you've\ntruly made something good, you're doing investors a <i>favor</i> by\ntelling them about it.  If you don't genuinely believe that, perhaps\nyou ought to change what your company is doing.  If you don't believe\nyour startup has such promise that you'd be doing them a favor by\nletting them invest, why are you investing your time in it?<br/><br/><b>10. Don't try to seem more than you are.</b><br/><br/>Don't worry if your company is just a few months old and doesn't\nhave an office yet, or your founders are technical people with no\nbusiness experience.  Google was like that once, and they turned out\nok.  Smart investors can see past such superficial flaws.  They're\nnot looking for finished, smooth presentations.  They're looking\nfor raw talent.  All you need to convince them of is that you're\nsmart and that you're onto something good.  If you try too hard to\nconceal your rawness—by trying to seem corporate, or pretending\nto know about stuff you don't—you may just conceal your talent.<br/><br/>You can afford to be candid about what you haven't figured out yet.\nDon't go out of your way to bring it up (e.g. by having a slide\nabout what might go wrong), but don't try to pretend either that\nyou're further along than you are.  If you're a hacker and you're\npresenting to experienced investors, they're probably better at\ndetecting bullshit than you are at producing it.<br/><br/><b>11. Don't put too many words on slides.</b><br/><br/>When there are a lot of words on a slide, people just skip reading\nit.  So look at your slides and ask of each word \"could I cross\nthis out?\"  This includes gratuitous clip art.  Try to get your\nslides under 20 words if you can.<br/><br/>Don't read your slides.  They should be something in the background\nas you face the audience and talk to them, not something you face\nand read to an audience sitting behind you.<br/><br/>Cluttered sites don't do well in demos, especially when they're\nprojected onto a screen.  At the very least, crank up the font size\nbig enough to make all the text legible.  But cluttered sites are\nbad anyway, so perhaps you should use this opportunity to make your\ndesign simpler.<br/><br/><b>12. Specific numbers are good.</b><br/><br/>If you have any kind of data, however preliminary, tell the audience.\nNumbers stick in people's heads.  If you can claim that the median\nvisitor generates 12 page views, that's great.<br/><br/>But don't give them more than four or five numbers, and only give\nthem numbers specific to you.  You don't need to tell them the size\nof the market you're in.  Who cares, really, if it's 500 million\nor 5 billion a year?  Talking about that is like an actor at the\nbeginning of his career telling his parents how much Tom Hanks\nmakes.  Yeah, sure, but first you have to become Tom Hanks.  The\nimportant part is not whether he makes ten million a year or a\nhundred, but how you get there.<br/><br/><b>13. Tell stories about users.</b><br/><br/>The biggest fear of investors looking at early stage startups is\nthat you've built something based on your own a priori theories of\nwhat the world needs, but that no one will actually want.  So it's\ngood if you can talk about problems specific users have and how you\nsolve them.<br/><br/>Greg Mcadoo said one thing Sequoia looks for is the \"proxy for\ndemand.\"  What are people doing now, using inadequate tools, that\nshows they need what you're making?<br/><br/>Another sign of user need is when people pay a lot for something.\nIt's easy to convince investors there will be demand for\na cheaper alternative to something popular, if you preserve\nthe qualities that made it popular.<br/><br/>The best stories about user needs are about your own.  A remarkable\nnumber of famous startups grew out of some need the founders had:\nApple, Microsoft, Yahoo, Google.  Experienced investors know that,\nso stories of this type will get their attention.  The next best\nthing is to talk about the needs of people you know personally,\nlike your friends or siblings.<br/><br/><b>14. Make a soundbite stick in their heads.</b><br/><br/>Professional investors hear a lot of pitches.  After a while they\nall blur together.  The first cut is simply to be one of those\nthey remember.  And the way to ensure that is to create a descriptive\nphrase about yourself that sticks in their heads.<br/><br/>In Hollywood, these phrases seem to be of the form \"x meets y.\"\n<!-- \"Brokeback Mountain meets Godzilla.\"  [Pauses to contemplate this.] -->\nIn the startup world, they're usually \"the x of y\" or \"the x y.\"\nViaweb's was \"the Microsoft Word of ecommerce.\"<br/><br/>Find one and launch it clearly (but apparently casually) in your\ntalk, preferably near the beginning.<br/><br/>It's a good exercise for you, too, to sit down and try to figure\nout how to describe your startup in one compelling phrase.  If you\ncan't, your plans may not be sufficiently focused.<br/><br/><br clear=\"all\"/></br></p></font>","date":"2006-08-01T00:00:00Z"}
