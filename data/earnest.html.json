{"href":"earnest.html","title":"Earnestness","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">December 2020<br/><br/>Jessica and I have certain words that have special significance\nwhen we're talking about startups. The highest compliment we can\npay to founders is to describe them as \"earnest.\" This is not by\nitself a guarantee of success. You could be earnest but incapable.\nBut when founders are both formidable (another of our words) and\nearnest, they're as close to unstoppable as you get.<br/><br/>Earnestness sounds like a boring, even Victorian virtue. It seems\na bit of an anachronism that people in Silicon Valley would care\nabout it. Why does this matter so much?<br/><br/>When you call someone earnest, you're making a statement about their\nmotives. It means both that they're doing something for the right\nreasons, and that they're trying as hard as they can. If we imagine\nmotives as vectors, it means both the direction and the magnitude\nare right. Though these are of course related: when people are doing\nsomething for the right reasons, they try harder.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/earnest.html#f1n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The reason motives matter so much in Silicon Valley is that so many\npeople there have the wrong ones. Starting a successful startup\nmakes you rich and famous. So a lot of the people trying to start\nthem are doing it for those reasons. Instead of what? Instead of\ninterest in the problem for its own sake. That is the root of\nearnestness. \n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/earnest.html#f2n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>It's also the hallmark of a nerd. Indeed, when people describe\nthemselves as \"x nerds,\" what they mean is that they're interested\nin x for its own sake, and not because it's cool to be interested\nin x, or because of what they can get from it. They're saying they\ncare so much about x that they're willing to sacrifice seeming cool\nfor its sake.<br/><br/>A <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/genius.html\"><u>genuine interest</u></a> \nin something is a very powerful motivator Â— for\nsome people, the most powerful motivator of all.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/earnest.html#f3n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">3</font></a>]</font>\nWhich is why\nit's what Jessica and I look for in founders. But as well as being\na source of strength, it's also a source of vulnerability. Caring\nconstrains you. The earnest can't easily reply in kind to mocking\nbanter, or put on a cool facade of nihil admirari. They care too\nmuch. They are doomed to be the straight man. That's a real\ndisadvantage in your \n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/nerds.html\"><u>teenage years</u></a>, \nwhen mocking banter and nihil\nadmirari often have the upper hand. But it becomes an advantage\nlater.<br/><br/>It's a commonplace now that the kids who were \nnerds in high school\nbecome the cool kids' bosses later on. But people misunderstand why\nthis happens. It's not just because the nerds are smarter, but also\nbecause they're more earnest. When the problems get harder than the\nfake ones you're given in high school, caring about them starts to\nmatter.<br/><br/>Does it always matter? Do the earnest always win? Not always. It\nprobably doesn't matter much in politics, or in crime, or in certain\ntypes of business that are similar to crime, like gambling, personal\ninjury law, patent trolling, and so on. Nor does it matter in\nacademic fields at the more \n<a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=hermeneutic+dialectics+hegemonic+phenomenology+intersectionality\"><u>bogus</u></a> end of the spectrum. And though\nI don't know enough to say for sure, it may not matter in some kinds\nof humor: it may be possible to be completely cynical and still be\nvery funny.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/earnest.html#f4n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">4</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Looking at the list of fields I mentioned, there's an obvious\npattern. Except possibly for humor, these are all types of work I'd\navoid like the plague. So that could be a useful heuristic for\ndeciding which fields to work in: how much does earnestness matter?\nWhich can in turn presumably be inferred from the prevalence of\nnerds at the top.<br/><br/>Along with \"nerd,\" another word that tends to be associated with\nearnestness is \"naive.\" The earnest often seem naive.  It's not\njust that they don't have the motives other people have. They often\ndon't fully grasp that such motives exist. Or they may know\nintellectually that they do, but because they don't feel them, they\nforget about them.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/earnest.html#f5n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">5</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>It works to be slightly naive not just about motives but also,\nbelieve it or not, about the problems you're working on. Naive\noptimism can compensate for the bit rot that \n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/ecw.html\"><u>rapid change</u></a> causes\nin established beliefs. You plunge into some problem saying \"How\nhard can it be?\", and then after solving it you learn that it was\ntill recently insoluble.<br/><br/>Naivete is an obstacle for anyone who wants to seem sophisticated,\nand this is one reason would-be intellectuals find it so difficult\nto understand Silicon Valley. It hasn't been safe for such people\nto use the word \"earnest\" outside scare quotes since Oscar Wilde\nwrote \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" in 1895. And yet when you\nzoom in on Silicon Valley, right into \n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/jessica.html\"><u>Jessica Livingston's brain</u></a>,\nthat's what her x-ray vision\nis seeking out in founders. Earnestness!\nWho'd have guessed? Reporters literally can't believe it when\nfounders making piles of money say that they started their companies\nto make the world better. The situation seems made for mockery.\nHow can these founders be so naive as not to realize how implausible\nthey sound?<br/><br/>Though those asking this question don't realize it, that's not a\nrhetorical question.<br/><br/>A lot of founders are faking it, of course, particularly the smaller\nfry, and the soon to be smaller fry. But not all of them. There are\na significant number of founders who really are interested in the\nproblem they're solving mainly for its own sake.<br/><br/>Why shouldn't there be? We have no difficulty believing that people\nwould be interested in history or math or even old bus tickets for\ntheir own sake. Why can't there be people interested in self-driving\ncars or social networks for their own sake? When you look at the\nquestion from this side, it seems obvious there would be. And isn't\nit likely that having a deep interest in something would be a source\nof great energy and resilience? It is in every other field.<br/><br/>The question really is why we have a blind spot about business.\nAnd the answer to that is obvious if you know enough history. For\nmost of history, making large amounts of money has not been very\nintellectually interesting. In preindustrial times it was never far\nfrom robbery, and some areas of business still retain that character,\nexcept using lawyers instead of soldiers.<br/><br/>But there are other areas of business where the work is genuinely\ninteresting. Henry Ford got to spend much of his time working on\ninteresting technical problems, and for the last several decades\nthe trend in that direction has been accelerating. It's much easier\nnow to make a lot of money by working on something you're interested\nin than it was <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/re.html\"><u>50 years ago</u></a>. \nAnd that, rather than how fast they\ngrow, may be the most important change that startups represent.\nThough indeed, the fact that the work is genuinely interesting is\na big part of why it gets done so fast.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/earnest.html#f6n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">6</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Can you imagine a more important change than one in the relationship\nbetween intellectual curiosity and money? These are two of the most\npowerful forces in the world, and in my lifetime they've become\nsignificantly more aligned. How could you not be fascinated to watch\nsomething like this happening in real time?<br/><br/>I meant this essay to be about earnestness generally, and now I've\ngone and talked about startups again. But I suppose at least it\nserves as an example of an x nerd in the wild.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nIt's interesting how many different ways there are <i>not</i> to\nbe earnest: to be cleverly cynical, to be superficially brilliant,\nto be conspicuously virtuous, to be cool, to be sophisticated, to\nbe orthodox, to be a snob, to bully, to pander, to be on the make.\nThis pattern suggests that earnestness is not one end of a continuum,\nbut a target one can fall short of in multiple dimensions.<br/><br/>Another thing I notice about this list is that it sounds like a\nlist of the ways people behave on Twitter. Whatever else social\nmedia is, it's a vivid catalogue of ways not to be earnest.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nPeople's motives are as mixed in Silicon Valley as anywhere\nelse. Even the founders motivated mostly by money tend to be at\nleast somewhat interested in the problem they're solving, and even\nthe founders most interested in the problem they're solving also\nlike the idea of getting rich. But there's great variation in the\nrelative proportions of different founders' motivations.<br/><br/>And when I talk about \"wrong\" motives, I don't mean morally wrong.\nThere's nothing morally wrong with starting a startup to make money.\nI just mean that those startups don't do as well.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nThe most powerful motivator for most people is probably family.\nBut there are some for whom intellectual curiosity comes first. In\nhis (wonderful) autobiography, Paul Halmos says explicitly that for\na mathematician, math must come before anything else, including\nfamily. Which at least implies that it did for him.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f4n\"><font color=\"#000000\">4</font></a>]\nInterestingly, just as the word \"nerd\" implies earnestness even\nwhen used as a metaphor, the word \"politics\" implies the opposite.\nIt's not only in actual politics that earnestness seems to be a\nhandicap, but also in office politics and academic politics.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f5n\"><font color=\"#000000\">5</font></a>]\nIt's a bigger social error to seem naive in most European\ncountries than it is in America, and this may be one of subtler\nreasons startups are less common there. Founder culture is completely\nat odds with sophisticated cynicism.<br/><br/>The most earnest part of Europe is Scandinavia, and not surprisingly\nthis is also the region with the highest number of successful\nstartups per capita.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f6n\"><font color=\"#000000\">6</font></a>]\nMuch of business is schleps, and probably always will be. But\neven being a professor is largely schleps. It would be interesting\nto collect statistics about the schlep ratios of different jobs,\nbut I suspect they'd rarely be less than 30%.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison, Suhail Doshi, Jessica\nLivingston, Mattias Ljungman, Harj Taggar, and Kyle Vogt for reading\ndrafts of this.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2020-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
