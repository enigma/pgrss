{"href":"distraction.html","title":"Disconnecting Distraction","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\"><i>Note: The strategy described at the end of this essay didn't work.\nIt would work for a while, and then I'd gradually find myself\nusing the Internet on my work computer.  I'm trying other\nstrategies now, but I think this time I'll wait till I'm sure\nthey work before writing about them.</i><br/><br/>May 2008<br/><br/>Procrastination feeds on distractions.  Most people find it\nuncomfortable just to sit and do nothing; you avoid work by doing\nsomething else.<br/><br/>So one way to beat procrastination is to starve it of distractions.\nBut that's not as straightforward as it sounds, because there are\npeople working hard to distract you.  Distraction is not a static\nobstacle that you avoid like you might avoid a rock in the road.\nDistraction seeks you out.<br/><br/>Chesterfield described dirt as matter out of place.  Distracting\nis, similarly, desirable at the wrong time.  And technology is\ncontinually being refined to produce more and more desirable things.\nWhich means that as we learn to avoid one class of distractions,\nnew ones constantly appear, like drug-resistant bacteria.<br/><br/>Television, for example, has after 50 years of refinement reached\nthe point where it's like visual crack.  I realized when I was 13\nthat TV was addictive, so I stopped watching it.  But I read recently\n that the average American watches \n<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2003/0929/076.html\">4 hours</a> \nof TV a day.  A quarter\nof their life.<br/><br/>TV is in decline now, but only because people have found even more\naddictive ways of wasting time.  And what's especially dangerous\nis that many happen at your computer.  This is no accident.  An\never larger percentage of office workers sit in front of computers\nconnected to the Internet, and distractions always evolve toward\nthe procrastinators.<br/><br/>I remember when computers were, for me at least, exclusively for\nwork.  I might occasionally dial up a server to get mail or ftp\nfiles, but most of the time I was offline.  All I could do was write\nand program.  Now I feel as if someone snuck a television onto my\ndesk.  Terribly addictive things are just a click away.  Run into\nan obstacle in what you're working on?  Hmm, I wonder what's new\nonline.  Better check.<br/><br/>After years of carefully avoiding classic time sinks like TV, games,\nand Usenet, I still managed to fall prey to distraction, because\nI didn't realize that it evolves.  Something that used to be safe,\nusing the Internet, gradually became more and more dangerous.  Some\ndays I'd wake up, get a cup of tea and check the news, then check\nemail, then check the news again, then answer a few emails, then\nsuddenly notice it was almost lunchtime and I hadn't gotten any real\nwork done.  And this started to happen more and more often.<br/><br/>It took me surprisingly long to realize how distracting the Internet\nhad become, because the problem was intermittent.  I ignored it the\nway you let yourself ignore a bug that only appears intermittently.  When\nI was in the middle of a project, distractions weren't really a\nproblem.  It was when I'd finished one project and was deciding\nwhat to do next that they always bit me.<br/><br/>Another reason it was hard to notice the danger of this new type\nof distraction was that social customs hadn't yet caught up with\nit.  If I'd spent a whole morning sitting on a sofa watching TV,\nI'd have noticed very quickly.  That's a known danger sign, like\ndrinking alone.  But using the Internet still looked and felt a \nlot like work.<br/><br/>Eventually, though, it became clear that the Internet had become so much\nmore distracting that I had to start treating it differently.\nBasically, I had to add a new application to my list of known time\nsinks: Firefox.<br/><br/><center>* * *</center><br/><br/>The problem is a hard one to solve because most people still need\nthe Internet for some things.  If you drink too much, you can solve\nthat problem by stopping entirely.  But you can't solve the problem\nof overeating by stopping eating.  I couldn't simply avoid the \nInternet entirely, as I'd done with previous time sinks.<br/><br/>At first I tried rules.  For example, I'd tell myself I was only\ngoing to use the Internet twice a day.  But these schemes never\nworked for long.  Eventually something would come up that required\nme to use it more than that.  And then I'd gradually slip back\ninto my old ways.<br/><br/>Addictive things have to be treated as if they were sentient\nadversariesâ€”as if there were a little man in your head always\ncooking up the most plausible arguments for doing whatever you're\ntrying to stop doing.  If you leave a path to it, he'll find it.<br/><br/>The key seems to be visibility.  The biggest ingredient in most bad habits\nis denial.  So you have to make it so that you can't merely <i>slip</i>\ninto doing the thing you're trying to avoid.  It has to set off\nalarms.<br/><br/>Maybe in the long term the right answer for dealing with Internet\ndistractions will be \n<a href=\"http://rescuetime.com\">software</a> that watches and controls them.  But\nin the meantime I've found a more drastic solution that definitely\nworks: to set up a separate computer for using the Internet.<br/><br/>I now leave wifi turned off on my main computer except when I need\nto transfer a file or edit a web page, and I have a separate laptop \non the other side\nof the room that I use to check mail or browse the web.  (Irony of\nironies, it's the computer Steve Huffman wrote Reddit on.  When\nSteve and Alexis auctioned off their old laptops for charity, I\nbought them for the Y Combinator museum.)<br/><br/>My rule is that I can spend as much time online as I want, as long\nas I do it on that computer.  And this turns out to be enough.  When\nI have to sit on the other side of the room to check email or browse\nthe web, I become much more aware of it.  Sufficiently aware, in\nmy case at least, that it's hard to spend more than about an hour\na day online.<br/><br/>And my main computer is now freed for work.  If you try this trick,\nyou'll probably be struck by how different it feels when your\ncomputer is disconnected from the Internet.  It was alarming to me\nhow foreign it felt to sit in front of a computer that could\nonly be used for work, because that showed how much time I must\nhave been wasting.<br/><br/><i>Wow.  All I can do at this computer is work.  Ok, I better work\nthen.</i><br/><br/>That's the good part.  Your old bad habits now help you to work.\nYou're used to sitting in front of that computer for hours at a\ntime.   But you can't browse the web or check email now.  What are\nyou going to do?  You can't just sit there.  So you start working.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2008-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
