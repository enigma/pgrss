You smile and say \"pleased to meet you,\"\nwhether you are or not.  There's nothing dishonest about this.\nEveryone knows that these little social lies aren't meant\nto be taken literally, just as everyone knows that \n\"Can you pass the salt?\" is only grammatically a question.<br/><br/>I'm perfectly willing to smile and say \"pleased to meet you\"\nwhen meeting new people.  But there is another set of \ncustoms for being ingratiating in print that are not so\nharmless.<br/><br/>The reason there's a convention of being ingratiating in print\nis that most essays are written to persuade.\nAnd as any politician could tell\nyou, the way to persuade people is not just to baldly state the\nfacts.  You have to add a spoonful of sugar to make the medicine\ngo down.<br/><br/>For example, a politician announcing the cancellation of \na government program will not merely say \"The\nprogram is canceled.\" That would seem offensively\ncurt.  Instead he'll spend most of his time talking about the\nnoble effort made by the people who worked on it.<br/><br/>The reason these conventions are more dangerous is that they\ninteract with the ideas.  Saying \"pleased to meet you\" is just\nsomething you prepend to a conversation, but the sort of spin \nadded by politicians is woven through it.  We're starting to\nmove from social lies to real lies.<br/><br/>Here's an example of a paragraph from an essay I wrote about\n<a href=\"unions.html\">labor unions</a>.  As written,\nit tends to offend people who like unions.\n<blockquote>\n  People who think the labor movement was the creation of heroic\n  union organizers have a problem to explain: why are unions shrinking\n  now?  The best they can do is fall back on the default explanation\n  of people living in fallen civilizations. Our ancestors were\n  giants.  The workers of the early twentieth century must have had\n  a moral courage that's lacking today.\n</blockquote>\nNow here's the same paragraph rewritten to please instead of\noffending them:\n<blockquote>\n  Early union organizers made heroic sacrifices to improve conditions\n  for workers.  But though\n  labor unions are shrinking now, it's not because present union\n  leaders are any less courageous.  An employer couldn't get away\n  with hiring thugs to beat up union leaders today, but if they\n  did, I see no reason to believe today's union leaders would shrink\n  from the challenge.  So I think it would be a mistake to attribute\n  the decline of unions to some kind of decline in the people who\n  run them.  Early union leaders were heroic, certainly, but we\n  should not suppose that if unions have declined, it's because\n  present union leaders are somehow inferior.  The cause must be\n  external.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f1n\"><font color=\"#999999\">1</font></a>]</font>\n</blockquote>\nIt makes the same point: that it can't have been the personal\nqualities of early union organizers that made unions successful,\nbut must have been some external factor, or otherwise present-day\nunion leaders would have to be inferior people.  But written this\nway it seems like a defense of present-day union organizers rather\nthan an attack on early ones.  That makes it more persuasive to\npeople who like unions, because it seems sympathetic to their cause.<br/><br/>I believe everything I wrote in the second version.  Early union\nleaders did make heroic sacrifices.   And\npresent union leaders probably would rise to the occasion if\nnecessary.  People tend to; I'm skeptical about the idea of \"the\ngreatest generation.\" \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f2n\"><font color=\"#999999\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>If I believe everything I said in the second version, why didn't I\nwrite it that way?  Why offend people needlessly?<br/><br/>Because I'd rather offend people than pander to them, \nand if you write about controversial topics you have to choose one or the other.  The degree of\ncourage of past or present union leaders is beside the point; all\nthat matters for the argument is that they're the same.\nBut if you want to please\npeople who are mistaken, you can't simply tell the truth.  You're\nalways going to have to add some sort of padding to protect their\nmisconceptions from bumping against reality.<br/><br/>Most writers do.  Most writers write to persuade, if only out of\nhabit or politeness.  But I don't write to persuade; I write to\nfigure out.  I write to persuade a hypothetical perfectly unbiased\nreader.<br/><br/>Since the custom is to write to persuade the actual reader, someone\nwho doesn't will seem arrogant.  In fact, worse than arrogant: since\nreaders are used to essays that try to please someone, an essay\nthat displeases one side in a dispute reads as an attempt to pander\nto the other.  To a lot of pro-union readers, the first paragraph\nsounds like the sort of thing a right-wing radio talk show host\nwould say to stir up his followers.  But it's not.  Something that\ncurtly contradicts one's beliefs can be hard to distinguish from a\npartisan attack on them, but though they can end up in the same\nplace they come from different sources.<br/><br/>Would it be so bad to add a few extra words, to make people feel\nbetter?  Maybe not.  Maybe I'm excessively attached to conciseness.\nI write <a href=\"power.html\">code</a> the same way I write essays, \nmaking pass after pass\nlooking for anything I can cut.  But I have a legitimate reason for\ndoing this.  You don't know what the ideas are until you get them\ndown to the fewest words.  \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f3n\"><font color=\"#999999\">3</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The danger of the second paragraph\nis not merely that it's longer.  It's that you start to lie to\nyourself.  The ideas start to get mixed together with the spin\nyou've added to get them past the readers' misconceptions.<br/><br/>I think the goal of an essay should be to discover \n<a href=\"essay.html\">surprising</a> things.  That's my goal, at least.\nAnd most surprising means most different from what people currently\nbelieve.  So writing to persuade and writing to discover are\ndiametrically opposed.  The more your conclusions disagree with\nreaders' present beliefs, the more effort you'll have to expend on\nselling your ideas rather than having them.  As you accelerate,\nthis drag increases, till eventually you reach a point where 100%\nof your energy is devoted to overcoming it and you can't go any\nfaster.<br/><br/>It's hard enough to overcome one's own misconceptions without having\nto think about how to get the resulting ideas past other people's.\nI worry that if I wrote to persuade, I'd start to shy away unconsciously\nfrom ideas I knew would be hard to sell.  When I notice something\nsurprising, it's usually very faint at first.  There's nothing more\nthan a slight stirring of discomfort.  I don't want anything to get\nin the way of noticing it consciously.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nI had a strange feeling of being back in high school writing\nthis.  To get a good grade you had to both write the sort of pious\ncrap you were expected to, but also seem to be writing with conviction.\nThe solution was a kind of method acting.  It was revoltingly\nfamiliar to slip back into it.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nExercise for the reader:\nrephrase that thought to please the same people the first version\nwould offend.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nCome to think of it, there is one way in which I deliberately\npander to readers, because it doesn't change the number of words:\nI switch person.  This flattering distinction seems so natural to\nthe average reader that they probably don't notice even when I\nswitch in mid-sentence, though you tend to notice when it's done\nas conspicuously as this.<br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Jessica Livingston and Robert Morris\nfor reading drafts of this.<br/><br/><b>Note:</b> An earlier version of this essay began by talking\nabout why people dislike Michael Arrington.  I now believe that\nwas mistaken, and that most people don't dislike him for the\nsame reason I did when I first met him, but simply because\nhe writes about controversial things.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2009-09-01T00:00:00Z"}
