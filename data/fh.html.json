{"href":"fh.html","title":"Haters","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">January 2020<br/><br/><i>(I originally intended this for startup founders, who are often\nsurprised by the attention they get as their companies grow, but\nit applies equally to anyone who becomes famous.)</i><br/><br/>If you become sufficiently famous, you'll acquire some fans who\nlike you too much. These people are sometimes called \"fanboys,\" and\nthough I dislike that term, I'm going to have to use it here.  We\nneed some word for them, because this is a distinct phenomenon from\nsomeone simply liking your work.<br/><br/>A fanboy is obsessive and uncritical. Liking you becomes part of\ntheir identity, and they create an image of you in their own head\nthat is much better than reality. Everything you do is good, because\nyou do it. If you do something bad, they find a way to see it as\ngood. And their love for you is not, usually, a quiet, private one.\nThey want everyone to know how great you are.<br/><br/>Well, you may be thinking, I could do without this kind of obsessive\nfan, but I know there are all kinds of people in the world, and if\nthis is the worst consequence of fame, that's not so bad.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this is not the worst consequence of fame. As well\nas fanboys, you'll have haters.<br/><br/>A hater is obsessive and uncritical. Disliking you becomes part of\ntheir identity, and they create an image of you in their own head\nthat is much worse than reality. Everything you do is bad, because\nyou do it. If you do something good, they find a way to see it as\nbad. And their dislike for you is not, usually, a quiet, private\none. They want everyone to know how awful you are.<br/><br/>If you're thinking of checking, I'll save you the trouble. The\nsecond and fifth paragraphs are identical except for \"good\" being\nswitched to \"bad\" and so on.<br/><br/>I spent years puzzling about haters.  What are they, and where do\nthey come from? Then one day it dawned on me. Haters are just fanboys\nwith the sign switched.<br/><br/>Note that by haters, I don't simply mean trolls. I'm not talking about \npeople who say bad things about you and then move on. I'm talking\nabout the much smaller group of people for whom this becomes a \nkind of obsession and who do it repeatedly over a long period.<br/><br/>Like fans, haters seem to be an automatic consequence of fame.\nAnyone sufficiently famous will have them. And like fans, haters\nare energized by the fame of whoever they hate. They hear a song\nby some pop singer. They don't like it much. If the singer were an\nobscure one, they'd just forget about it. But instead they keep\nhearing her name, and this seems to drive some people crazy.\nEveryone's always going on about this singer, but she's no good!\nShe's a fraud!<br/><br/>That word \"fraud\" is an important one. It's the spectral signature\nof a hater to regard the object of their hatred as a \n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=Musk%20fraud&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live\"><u>fraud</u></a>. They\ncan't deny their fame. Indeed, their fame is if anything exaggerated\nin the hater's mind. They notice every mention of the singer's name,\nbecause every mention makes them angrier. In their own minds they\nexaggerate both the singer's fame and her lack of talent, and the\nonly way to reconcile those two ideas is to conclude that she has\ntricked everyone.<br/><br/>What sort of people become haters? Can anyone become one? I'm not\nsure about this, but I've noticed some patterns. Haters are generally\nlosers in a very specific sense: although they are occasionally\ntalented, they have never achieved much. And indeed, anyone\nsuccessful enough to have achieved significant fame would be unlikely\nto regard another famous person as a fraud on that account, because\nanyone famous knows how random fame is.<br/><br/>But haters are not always complete losers. They are not always the\nproverbial guy living in his mom's basement. Many are, but some\nhave some amount of talent. In fact I suspect that a sense of\nfrustrated talent is what drives some people to become haters.\nThey're not just saying \"It's unfair that so-and-so is famous,\" but\n\"It's unfair that so-and-so is famous, and not me.\"<br/><br/>Could a hater be cured if they achieved something impressive? My\nguess is that's a moot point, because they \n<a href=\"mean.html\"><u>never will</u></a>. I've been\nable to observe for long enough that I'm fairly confident the pattern\nworks both ways: not only do people who do great work never become\nhaters, haters never do great work. Although I dislike the word\n\"fanboy,\" it's evocative of something important about both haters\nand fanboys. It implies that the fanboy is so slavishly predictable in his admiration\nthat he's diminished as a result, that he's less than a man.<br/><br/>Haters seem even more diminished. I can imagine being a fanboy.\nI can think of people whose work I admire so much that I could abase\nmyself before them out of sheer gratitude. If P. G.  Wodehouse were\nstill alive, I could see myself being a Wodehouse fanboy. But I\ncould not imagine being a hater.<br/><br/>Knowing that haters are just fanboys with the sign bit flipped makes\nit much easier to deal with them. We don't need a separate theory\nof haters. We can just use existing techniques for dealing with\nobsessive fans.<br/><br/>The most important of which is simply not to think much about them.\nIf you're like most people who become famous enough to acquire\nhaters, your initial reaction will be one of mystification. Why\ndoes this guy seem to have it in for me? Where does his obsessive\nenergy come from, and what makes him so appallingly nasty? What did\nI do to set him off? Is it something I can fix?<br/><br/>The mistake here is to think of the hater as someone you have a\ndispute with. When you have a dispute with someone, it's usually a\ngood idea to try to understand why they're upset and then fix things\nif you can. Disputes are distracting. But it's a false analogy to\nthink of a hater as someone you have a dispute with.  It's an\nunderstandable mistake, if you've never encountered haters before.\nBut when you realize that you're dealing with a hater, and what a\nhater is, it's clear that it's a waste of time even to think about\nthem. If you have obsessive fans, do you spend any time wondering\nwhat makes them love you so much? No, you just think \"some\npeople are kind of crazy,\" and that's the end of it.<br/><br/>Since haters are equivalent to fanboys, that's the way to deal with\nthem too. There may have been something that set them off. But it's\nnot something that would have set off a normal person, so there's\nno reason to spend any time thinking about it. It's not you, it's\nthem.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[1] There are of course some people who are genuine frauds. How can\nyou distinguish between x calling y a fraud because x is a hater,\nand because y is a fraud? Look at neutral opinion. Actual frauds\nare usually pretty conspicuous. Thoughtful people are rarely taken\nin by them. So if there are some thoughtful people who like y, you\ncan usually assume y is not a fraud.<br/><br/>[2] I would make an exception for teenagers, who sometimes act in\nsuch extreme ways that they are literally not themselves. I can\nimagine a teenage kid being a hater and then growing out of it. But\nnot anyone over 25.<br/><br/>[3] I have a much worse memory for misdeeds than my wife Jessica,\nwho is a connoisseur of character, but I don't wish it were better.\nMost disputes are a waste of time even if you're in the right, and\nit's easy to bury the hatchet with someone if you can't remember\nwhy you were mad at them.<br/><br/>[4] A competent hater will not merely attack you individually but\nwill try to get mobs after you. In some cases you may want to refute\nwhatever bogus claim they made in order to do so. But err on the\nside of not, because ultimately it probably won't matter.<br/><br/><br/><br/><font color=\"888888\"><b>Thanks</b> to Austen Allred, Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison,\nChristine Ford, Daniel Gackle, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, \nElon Musk, Harj Taggar, and Peter Thiel for reading drafts of this.</font><br/><br/></font>","date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
