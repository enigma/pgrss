You can sense it when you\nwalk around one.  In a hundred subtle ways, the city sends you a\nmessage: you could do more; you should try harder.<br/><br/>The surprising thing is how different these messages can be.  New\nYork tells you, above all: you should make more money.  There are\nother messages too, of course.  You should be hipper.  You should\nbe better looking.  But the clearest message is that you should be\nricher.<br/><br/>What I like about Boston (or rather Cambridge) is that the message\nthere is: you should be smarter.  You really should get around to\nreading all those books you've been meaning to.<br/><br/>When you ask what message a city sends, you sometimes get surprising\nanswers.  As much as they respect brains in Silicon Valley, the\nmessage the Valley sends is: you should be more powerful.<br/><br/>That's not quite the same message New York sends.  Power matters\nin New York too of course, but New York is pretty impressed by a\nbillion dollars even if you merely inherited it.  In Silicon Valley\nno one would care except a few real estate agents.  What matters\nin Silicon Valley is how much effect you have on the world.  The\nreason people there care about Larry and Sergey is not their wealth\nbut the fact that they control Google, which affects practically\neveryone.<br/><br/><center>_____</center><br/><br/>How much does it matter what message a city sends?  Empirically,\nthe answer seems to be: a lot. You might think that if you had\nenough strength of mind to do great things, you'd be able to transcend\nyour environment.  Where you live should make at most a couple\npercent difference.  But if you look at the historical evidence,\nit seems to matter more than that.  Most people who did great things\nwere clumped together in a few places where that sort of thing was\ndone at the time.<br/><br/>You can see how powerful cities are from something I wrote about\n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/taste.html\">earlier</a>: the case of the Milanese Leonardo.  \nPractically every\nfifteenth century Italian painter you've heard of was from Florence,\neven though Milan was just as big.  People in Florence weren't\ngenetically different, so you have to assume there was someone born\nin Milan with as much natural ability as Leonardo.  What happened\nto him?<br/><br/>If even someone with the same natural ability as Leonardo\ncouldn't beat the force of environment, do you suppose you can?<br/><br/>I don't.  I'm fairly stubborn, but I wouldn't try to fight this\nforce.  I'd rather use it.  So I've thought a lot about where to\nlive.<br/><br/>I'd always imagined Berkeley would be the ideal place — that\nit would basically be Cambridge with good weather.  But when I\nfinally tried living there a couple years ago, it turned out not\nto be.  The message Berkeley sends is: you should live better.  Life\nin Berkeley is very civilized.  It's probably the place in America\nwhere someone from Northern Europe would feel most at home.  But\nit's not humming with ambition.<br/><br/>In retrospect it shouldn't have been surprising that a place so\npleasant would attract people interested above all in quality of\nlife.  Cambridge with good weather, it turns out, is not Cambridge.\nThe people you find in Cambridge are not there by accident.  You\nhave to make sacrifices to live there.  It's expensive and somewhat\ngrubby, and the weather's often bad.  So the kind of people you\nfind in Cambridge are the kind of people who want to live where the\nsmartest people are, even if that means living in an expensive,\ngrubby place with bad weather.<br/><br/>As of this writing, Cambridge seems to be the intellectual capital\nof the world.  I realize that seems a preposterous claim.  What\nmakes it true is that it's more preposterous to claim about anywhere\nelse.  American universities currently seem to be the best, judging\nfrom the flow of ambitious students.  And what US city has a stronger\nclaim?  New York?  A fair number of smart people, but diluted by a\nmuch larger number of neanderthals in suits.  The Bay Area has a\nlot of smart people too, but again, diluted;  there are two great\nuniversities, but they're far apart.  Harvard and MIT are practically\nadjacent by West Coast standards, and they're surrounded by about\n20 other colleges and universities.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/cities.html#f1n\"><font color=\"#999999\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Cambridge as a result feels like a town whose main industry is\nideas, while New York's is finance and Silicon Valley's is startups.<br/><br/><center>_____</center><br/><br/>When you talk about cities in the sense we are, what you're really\ntalking about is collections of people.  For a long time cities\nwere the only large collections of people, so you could use the two\nideas interchangeably.  But we can see how much things are changing\nfrom the examples I've mentioned.  New York is a classic great city.\nBut Cambridge is just part of a city, and Silicon Valley is not\neven that.  (San Jose is not, as it sometimes claims, the capital\nof Silicon Valley.  It's just 178 square miles at one end of it.)<br/><br/>Maybe the Internet will change things further.  Maybe one day the\nmost important community you belong to will be a virtual one, and\nit won't matter where you live physically.  But I wouldn't bet on\nit.  The physical world is very high bandwidth, and some of the\nways cities send you messages are quite subtle.<br/><br/>One of the exhilarating things about coming back to Cambridge every\nspring is walking through the streets at dusk, when you can see\ninto the houses.  When you walk through Palo Alto in the evening,\nyou see nothing but the blue glow of TVs.  In Cambridge you see\nshelves full of promising-looking books.  Palo Alto was probably\nmuch like Cambridge in 1960, but you'd never guess now that there\nwas a university nearby.  Now it's just one of the richer neighborhoods\nin Silicon Valley. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/cities.html#f2n\"><font color=\"#999999\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>A city speaks to you mostly by accident — in things you see\nthrough windows, in conversations you overhear.  It's not something\nyou have to seek out, but something you can't turn off.  One of the\noccupational hazards of living in Cambridge is overhearing the\nconversations of people who use interrogative intonation in declarative\nsentences.  But on average I'll take Cambridge conversations over\nNew York or Silicon Valley ones.<br/><br/>A friend who moved to Silicon Valley in the late 90s said the worst\nthing about living there was the low quality of the eavesdropping.\nAt the time I thought she was being deliberately eccentric. Sure,\nit can be interesting to eavesdrop on people, but is good quality\neavesdropping so important that it would affect where you chose to\nlive?  Now I understand what she meant.  The conversations you\noverhear tell you what sort of people you're among.<br/><br/><center>_____</center><br/><br/>No matter how determined you are, it's hard not to be influenced\nby the people around you.  It's not so much that you do whatever a\ncity expects of you, but that you get discouraged when no one around\nyou cares about the same things you do.<br/><br/>There's an imbalance between encouragement and discouragement like\nthat between gaining and losing money.  Most people overvalue\nnegative amounts of money: they'll work much harder to avoid losing\na dollar than to gain one.  Similarly, although there are plenty of\npeople strong enough to resist doing something just because that's\nwhat one is supposed to do where they happen to be, there are few\nstrong enough to keep working on something no one around them cares\nabout.<br/><br/>Because ambitions are to some extent incompatible and admiration\nis a zero-sum game, each city tends to focus on one type of ambition.\nThe reason Cambridge is the intellectual capital is not just that\nthere's a concentration of smart people there, but that there's\nnothing <i>else</i> people there care about more.  Professors in\nNew York and the Bay area are second class citizens — till they\nstart hedge funds or startups respectively.<br/><br/>This suggests an answer to a question people in New York have\nwondered about since the Bubble: whether New York could grow into\na startup hub to rival Silicon Valley.  One reason that's unlikely\nis that someone starting a startup in New York would feel like a\nsecond class citizen. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/cities.html#f3n\"><font color=\"#999999\">3</font></a>]</font>\nThere's already something else people in New York admire more.<br/><br/>In the long term, that could be a bad thing for New York.  The power\nof an important new technology does eventually convert to money.\nSo by caring more about money and less about power than Silicon\nValley, New York is recognizing the same thing, but slower.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/cities.html#f4n\"><font color=\"#999999\">4</font></a>]</font>\nAnd in fact it has been losing to Silicon Valley at its own game:\nthe ratio of New York to California residents in the Forbes 400 has\ndecreased from 1.45 (81:56) when the list was first published in\n1982 to .83 (73:88) in 2007.<br/><br/><center>_____</center><br/><br/>Not all cities send a message.  Only those that are centers for\nsome type of ambition do.  And it can be hard to tell exactly what\nmessage a city sends without living there.  I understand the messages\nof New York, Cambridge, and Silicon Valley because I've lived for\nseveral years in each of them.  DC and LA seem to send messages\ntoo, but I haven't spent long enough in either to say for sure what\nthey are.<br/><br/>The big thing in LA seems to be fame.  There's an A List of people\nwho are most in demand right now, and what's most admired is to be\non it, or friends with those who are.  Beneath that, the message is\nmuch like New York's, though perhaps with more emphasis on physical\nattractiveness.<br/><br/>In DC the message seems to be that the most important thing is who\nyou know.  You want to be an insider.  In practice this seems to\nwork much as in LA.  There's an A List and you want to be on it or\nclose to those who are.  The only difference is how the A List is\nselected.  And even that is not that different.<br/><br/>At the moment, San Francisco's message seems to be the same as\nBerkeley's: you should live better.  But this will change if enough\nstartups choose SF over the Valley.  During the Bubble that was a\npredictor of failure — a self-indulgent choice, like buying\nexpensive office furniture.  Even now I'm suspicious when startups\nchoose SF.  But if enough good ones do, it stops being a self-indulgent\nchoice, because the center of gravity of Silicon Valley will shift\nthere.<br/><br/>I haven't found anything like Cambridge for intellectual ambition.\nOxford and Cambridge (England) feel like Ithaca or Hanover: the\nmessage is there, but not as strong.<br/><br/>Paris was once a great intellectual center.  If you went there in\n1300, it might have sent the message Cambridge does now.  But I\ntried living there for a bit last year, and the ambitions of the\ninhabitants are not intellectual ones.  The message Paris sends now\nis: do things with style.  I liked that, actually.  Paris is the\nonly city I've lived in where people genuinely cared about art.  In\nAmerica only a few rich people buy original art, and even the more\nsophisticated ones rarely get past judging it by the brand name of\nthe artist.  But looking through windows at dusk in Paris you can\nsee that people there actually care what paintings look like.\nVisually, Paris has the best eavesdropping I know. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/cities.html#f5n\"><font color=\"#999999\">5</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>There's one more message I've heard from cities: in London you can\nstill (barely) hear the message that one should be more aristocratic.\nIf you listen for it you can also hear it in Paris, New York, and\nBoston.  But this message is everywhere very faint.  It would have\nbeen strong 100 years ago, but now I probably wouldn't have picked\nit up at all if I hadn't deliberately tuned in to that wavelength\nto see if there was any signal left.<br/><br/><center>_____</center><br/><br/>So far the complete list of messages I've picked up from cities is:\nwealth, style, hipness, physical attractiveness, fame, political\npower, economic power, intelligence, social class, and quality of\nlife.<br/><br/>My immediate reaction to this list is that it makes me slightly\nqueasy.  I'd always considered ambition a good thing, but I realize\nnow that was because I'd always implicitly understood it to mean\nambition in the areas I cared about.  When you list everything\nambitious people are ambitious about, it's not so pretty.<br/><br/>On closer examination I see a couple things on the list that are\nsurprising in the light of history.  For example, physical\nattractiveness wouldn't have been there 100 years ago (though it\nmight have been 2400 years ago).  It has always mattered for women,\nbut in the late twentieth century it seems to have started to matter\nfor men as well.  I'm not sure why — probably some combination\nof the increasing power of women, the increasing influence of actors\nas models, and the fact that so many people work in offices now:\nyou can't show off by wearing clothes too fancy to wear in a factory,\nso you have to show off with your body instead.<br/><br/>Hipness is another thing you wouldn't have seen on the list 100\nyears ago.  Or wouldn't you?  What it means is to know what's what.\nSo maybe it has simply replaced the component of social class that\nconsisted of being \"au fait.\"  That could explain why hipness seems\nparticularly admired in London: it's version 2 of the traditional\nEnglish delight in obscure codes that only insiders understand.<br/><br/>Economic power would have been on the list 100 years ago, but what\nwe mean by it is changing.  It used to mean the control of vast\nhuman and material resources.  But increasingly it means the ability\nto direct the course of technology, and some of the people in a\nposition to do that are not even rich — leaders of important\nopen source projects, for example.  The Captains of Industry of\ntimes past had laboratories full of clever people cooking up new\ntechnologies for them.  The new breed are themselves those people.<br/><br/>As this force gets more attention, another is dropping off the list:\nsocial class.  I think the two changes are related.  Economic power,\nwealth, and social class are just names for the same thing at\ndifferent stages in its life: economic power converts to wealth,\nand wealth to social class.  So the focus of admiration is simply\nshifting upstream.<br/><br/><center>_____</center><br/><br/>Does anyone who wants to do great work have to live in a great city?\nNo; all great cities inspire some sort of ambition, but they aren't\nthe only places that do.  For some kinds of work, all you need is\na handful of talented colleagues.<br/><br/>What cities provide is an audience, and a funnel for peers.  These\naren't so critical in something like math or physics, where no\naudience matters except your peers, and judging ability is sufficiently\nstraightforward that hiring and admissions committees can do it\nreliably.  In a field like math or physics all you need is a\ndepartment with the right colleagues in it.  It could be anywhere — in\nLos Alamos, New Mexico, for example.<br/><br/>It's in fields like the arts or writing or technology that the\nlarger environment matters.  In these the best practitioners aren't\nconveniently collected in a few top university departments and\nresearch labs — partly because talent is harder to judge, and\npartly because people pay for these things, so one doesn't need to\nrely on teaching or research funding to support oneself.  It's in\nthese more chaotic fields that it helps most to be in a great city:\nyou need the encouragement of feeling that people around you care\nabout the kind of work you do, and since you have to find peers for\nyourself, you need the much larger intake mechanism of a great city.<br/><br/>You don't have to live in a great city your whole life to benefit\nfrom it.  The critical years seem to be the early and middle ones\nof your career.  Clearly you don't have to grow up in a great city.\nNor does it seem to matter if you go to college in one.  To most\ncollege students a world of a few thousand people seems big enough.\nPlus in college you don't yet have to face the hardest kind of\nwork — discovering new problems to solve.<br/><br/>It's when you move on to the next and much harder step that it helps\nmost to be in a place where you can find peers and encouragement.\nYou seem to be able to leave, if you want, once you've found both.\nThe Impressionists show the typical pattern: they were born all\nover France (Pissarro was born in the Carribbean) and died all over\nFrance, but what defined them were the years they spent together\nin Paris.<br/><br/><center>_____</center><br/><br/>Unless you're sure what you want to do and where the leading center\nfor it is, your best bet is probably to try living in several\nplaces when you're young.  You can never tell what message a city\nsends till you live there, or even whether it still sends one.\nOften your information will be wrong: I tried living in Florence\nwhen I was 25, thinking it would be an art center, but it turned\nout I was 450 years too late.<br/><br/>Even when a city is still a live center of ambition, you won't know\nfor sure whether its message will resonate with you till you hear\nit.  When I moved to New York, I was very excited at first.  It's\nan exciting place.  So it took me quite a while to realize I just\nwasn't like the people there.  I kept searching for the Cambridge\nof New York.  It turned out it was way, way uptown: an hour uptown\nby air.<br/><br/>Some people know at 16 what sort of work they're going to do, but\nin most ambitious kids, ambition seems to precede anything specific\nto be ambitious about.  They know they want to do something great.\nThey just haven't decided yet whether they're going to be a rock\nstar or a brain surgeon.  There's nothing wrong with that.  But it\nmeans if you have this most common type of ambition, you'll probably\nhave to figure out where to live by trial and error.  You'll\nprobably have to find the city where you feel at home to know what sort of\nambition you have.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nThis is one of the advantages of not having the universities\nin your country controlled by the government.  When governments\ndecide how to allocate resources, political deal-making causes\nthings to be spread out geographically.  No central goverment would\nput its two best universities in the same town, unless it was the\ncapital (which would cause other problems).  But scholars seem to\nlike to cluster together as much as people in any other field, and\nwhen given the freedom to they derive the same advantages from it.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nThere are still a few old professors in Palo Alto, but one by\none they die and their houses are transformed by developers into\nMcMansions and sold to VPs of Bus Dev.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nHow many times have you read about startup founders who continued\nto live inexpensively as their companies took off?  Who continued\nto dress in jeans and t-shirts, to drive the old car they had in\ngrad school, and so on?  If you did that in New York, people would\ntreat you like shit.  If you walk into a fancy restaurant in San\nFrancisco wearing a jeans and a t-shirt, they're nice to you; who\nknows who you might be?  Not in New York.<br/><br/>One sign of a city's potential as a technology center is the number\nof restaurants that still require jackets for men.  According to\nZagat's there are none in San Francisco, LA, Boston, or Seattle, \n4 in DC, 6 in Chicago, 8 in London, 13 in New York, and 20 in Paris.<br/><br/>(Zagat's lists the Ritz Carlton Dining Room in SF as requiring jackets\nbut I couldn't believe it, so I called to check and in fact they\ndon't. Apparently there's only one restaurant left on the entire West\nCoast that still requires jackets: The French Laundry in Napa Valley.)<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f4n\"><font color=\"#000000\">4</font></a>]\nIdeas are one step upstream from economic power, so it's\nconceivable that intellectual centers like Cambridge will one day\nhave an edge over Silicon Valley like the one the Valley has over\nNew York.<br/><br/>This seems unlikely at the moment; if anything Boston is falling\nfurther and further behind.  The only reason I even mention the\npossibility is that the path from ideas to startups has recently\nbeen getting smoother.  It's a lot easier now for a couple of hackers\nwith no business experience to start a startup than it was 10 years\nago.  If you extrapolate another 20 years, maybe the balance of\npower will start to shift back.  I wouldn't bet on it, but I wouldn't\nbet against it either.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f5n\"><font color=\"#000000\">5</font></a>]\nIf Paris is where people care most about art, why is New York\nthe center of gravity of the art business?  Because in the twentieth\ncentury, art as brand split apart from art as stuff.  New York is\nwhere the richest buyers are, but all they demand from art is brand,\nand since you can base brand on anything with a sufficiently\nidentifiable style, you may as well use the local stuff.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica Livingston,\nJackie McDonough, Robert Morris, and David Sloo for reading drafts\nof this.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2008-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
