The total value of the companies we've funded\nis around 10 billion, give or take a few.  But just two companies,\nDropbox and Airbnb, account for about three quarters of it.<br/><br/>In startups, the big winners are big to a degree that violates our\nexpectations about variation.  I don't know whether these expectations\nare innate or learned, but whatever the cause, we are just not\nprepared for the 1000x variation in outcomes that one finds in\nstartup investing.<br/><br/>That yields all sorts of strange consequences.  For example, in\npurely financial terms, there is probably at most one company in\neach YC batch that will have a significant effect on our returns,\nand the rest are just a cost of doing business.  \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/swan.html#f1n\"><font color=\"#999999\">1</font></a>]</font>\nI haven't\nreally assimilated that fact, partly because it's so counterintuitive,\nand partly because we're not doing this just for financial reasons;\nYC would be a pretty lonely place if we only had one company per\nbatch.  And yet it's true.<br/><br/>To succeed in a domain that violates your intuitions, you need to\nbe able to turn them off the way a pilot does when flying through\nclouds. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/swan.html#f2n\"><font color=\"#999999\">2</font></a>]</font>\n  You need to do what you know intellectually to be\nright, even though it feels wrong.<br/><br/>It's a constant battle for us.  It's hard to make ourselves take\nenough risks. When you interview a startup and think \"they seem\nlikely to succeed,\" it's hard not to fund them.  And yet, financially\nat least, there is only one kind of success: they're either going\nto be one of the really big winners or not, and if not it doesn't\nmatter whether you fund them, because even if they succeed the\neffect on your returns will be insignificant.  In the same day of\ninterviews you might meet some smart 19 year olds who aren't even\nsure what they want to work on. Their chances of succeeding seem\nsmall.  But again, it's not their chances of succeeding that matter\nbut their chances of succeeding really big.  The probability that\nany group will succeed really big is microscopically small, but the\nprobability that those 19 year olds will might be higher than that\nof the other, safer group.<br/><br/>The probability that a startup will make it big is not simply a\nconstant fraction of the probability that they will succeed at all.\nIf it were, you could fund everyone who seemed likely to succeed\nat all, and you'd get that fraction of big hits.  Unfortunately\npicking winners is harder than that.  You have to ignore the elephant\nin front of you, the likelihood they'll succeed, and focus instead\non the separate and almost invisibly intangible question of whether\nthey'll succeed really big.<br/><br/><b>Harder</b><br/><br/>That's made harder by the fact that the best startup ideas seem at\nfirst like bad ideas.  I've written about this before: if a good\nidea were obviously good, someone else would already have done it.\nSo the most successful founders tend to work on ideas that few\nbeside them realize are good.  Which is not that far from a description\nof insanity, till you reach the point where you see results.<br/><br/>The first time Peter Thiel spoke at YC he drew a Venn diagram that\nillustrates the situation perfectly.  He drew two intersecting\ncircles, one labelled \"seems like a bad idea\" and the other \"is a\ngood idea.\"  The intersection is the sweet spot for startups.<br/><br/>This concept is a simple one and yet seeing it as a Venn diagram\nis illuminating.  It reminds you that there is an intersectionâ€”that\nthere are good ideas that seem bad.  It also reminds you that the\nvast majority of ideas that seem bad are bad.<br/><br/>The fact that the best ideas seem like bad ideas makes it even\nharder to recognize the big winners.  It means the probability of\na startup making it really big is not merely not a constant fraction\nof the probability that it will succeed, but that the startups with\na high probability of the former will seem to have a disproportionately\nlow probability of the latter.<br/><br/>History tends to get rewritten by big successes, so that in retrospect\nit seems obvious they were going to make it big.  For that reason\none of my most valuable memories is how lame Facebook sounded to\nme when I first heard about it.  A site for college students to\nwaste time?  It seemed the perfect bad idea: a site (1) for a niche\nmarket (2) with no money (3) to do something that didn't matter.<br/><br/>One could have described Microsoft and Apple in exactly the same\nterms.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/swan.html#f3n\"><font color=\"#999999\">3</font></a>]</font><br/><br/><b>Harder Still</b><br/><br/>Wait, it gets worse.  You not only have to solve this hard problem,\nbut you have to do it with no indication of whether you're succeeding.\nWhen you pick a big winner, you won't know it for two years.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the one thing you <i>can</i> measure is dangerously\nmisleading.  The one thing we can track precisely is how well the\nstartups in each batch do at fundraising after Demo Day.  But we\nknow that's the wrong metric.  There's no correlation between the\npercentage of startups that raise money and the metric that does\nmatter financially, whether that batch of startups contains a big\nwinner or not.<br/><br/>Except an inverse one.  That's the scary thing: fundraising is not\nmerely a useless metric, but positively misleading.  We're in a\nbusiness where we need to pick unpromising-looking outliers, and\nthe huge scale of the successes means we can afford to spread our\nnet very widely.  The big winners could generate 10,000x returns.\nThat means for each big winner we could pick a thousand companies\nthat returned nothing and still end up 10x ahead.<br/><br/>If we ever got to the point where 100% of the startups we funded\nwere able to raise money after Demo Day, it would almost certainly\nmean we were being too conservative.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/swan.html#f4n\"><font color=\"#999999\">4</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>It takes a conscious effort not to do that too.  After 15 cycles\nof preparing startups for investors and then watching how they do,\nI can now look at a group we're interviewing through Demo Day\ninvestors' eyes.  But those are the wrong eyes to look through!<br/><br/>We can afford to take at least 10x as much risk as Demo Day investors.\nAnd since risk is usually proportionate to reward, if you can afford\nto take more risk you should.  What would it mean to take 10x more\nrisk than Demo Day investors?  We'd have to be willing to fund 10x\nmore startups than they would.  Which means that even if we're\ngenerous to ourselves and assume that YC can on average triple a\nstartup's expected value, we'd be taking the right amount of risk\nif only 30% of the startups were able to raise significant funding\nafter Demo Day.<br/><br/>I don't know what fraction of them currently raise more after Demo\nDay.  I deliberately avoid calculating that number, because if you\nstart measuring something you start optimizing it, and I know it's\nthe wrong thing to optimize.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/swan.html#f5n\"><font color=\"#999999\">5</font></a>]</font>\nBut the percentage is certainly\nway over 30%.  And frankly the thought of a 30% success rate at\nfundraising makes my stomach clench.  A Demo Day where only 30% of\nthe startups were fundable would be a shambles.  Everyone would\nagree that YC had jumped the shark. We ourselves would feel that\nYC had jumped the shark.  And yet we'd all be wrong.<br/><br/>For better or worse that's never going to be more than a thought\nexperiment.  We could never stand it.  How about that for\ncounterintuitive?  I can lay out what I know to be the right thing\nto do, and still not do it.  I can make up all sorts of plausible\njustifications.  It would hurt YC's brand (at least among the\ninnumerate) if we invested in huge numbers of risky startups that\nflamed out.  It might dilute the value of the alumni network.\nPerhaps most convincingly, it would be demoralizing for us to be\nup to our chins in failure all the time.  But I know the real reason\nwe're so conservative is that we just haven't assimilated the fact\nof 1000x variation in returns.<br/><br/>We'll probably never be able to bring ourselves to take risks\nproportionate to the returns in this business.  The best we can\nhope for is that when we interview a group and find ourselves\nthinking \"they seem like good founders, but what are investors going\nto think of this crazy idea?\" we'll continue to be able to say \"who\ncares what investors think?\"  That's what we thought about Airbnb,\nand if we want to fund more Airbnbs we have to stay good at thinking\nit.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nI'm not saying that the big winners are all that matters, just\nthat they're all that matters financially for investors.  Since\nwe're not doing YC mainly for financial reasons, the big winners\naren't all that matters to us.  We're delighted to have funded\nReddit, for example. Even though we made comparatively little from\nit, Reddit has had a big effect on the world, and it introduced us\nto Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian, both of whom have become good\nfriends.<br/><br/>Nor do we push founders to try to become one of the big winners if\nthey don't want to. We didn't \"swing for the fences\" in our own\nstartup (Viaweb, which was acquired for $50 million), and it would\nfeel pretty bogus to press founders to do something we didn't do.\nOur rule is that it's up to the founders.  Some want to take over\nthe world, and some just want that first few million.  But we invest\nin so many companies that we don't have to sweat any one outcome.\nIn fact, we don't have to sweat whether startups have exits at all.\nThe biggest exits are the only ones that matter financially, and\nthose are guaranteed in the sense that if a company becomes big\nenough, a market for its shares will inevitably arise.  Since the\nremaining outcomes don't have a significant effect on returns, it's\ncool with us if the founders want to sell early for a small amount,\nor grow slowly and never sell (i.e. become a so-called lifestyle\nbusiness), or even shut the company down.  We're sometimes disappointed\nwhen a startup we had high hopes for doesn't do well, but this\ndisappointment is mostly the ordinary variety that anyone feels\nwhen that happens.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nWithout visual cues (e.g. the horizon) you can't distinguish\nbetween gravity and acceleration.  Which means if you're flying\nthrough clouds you can't tell what the attitude of\nthe aircraft is.  You could feel like you're flying straight and\nlevel while in fact you're descending in a spiral.  The solution\nis to ignore what your body is telling you and listen only to your\ninstruments.  But it turns out to be very hard to ignore what your\nbody is telling you.  Every pilot knows about this \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_disorientation\">problem</a> and yet\nit is still a leading cause of accidents.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nNot all big hits follow this pattern though. The reason Google\nseemed a bad idea was that there were already lots of search engines\nand there didn't seem to be room for another.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f4n\"><font color=\"#000000\">4</font></a>]\nA startup's success at fundraising is a function of two things:\nwhat they're selling and how good they are at selling it.  And while\nwe can teach startups a lot about how to appeal to investors, even\nthe most convincing pitch can't sell an idea that investors don't\nlike.  I was genuinely worried that Airbnb, for example, would not\nbe able to raise money after Demo Day.  I couldn't convince <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/airbnb.html\">Fred Wilson</a> to fund them.  They might not\nhave raised money at all but for the coincidence that Greg McAdoo,\nour contact at Sequoia, was one of a handful of VCs who understood\nthe vacation rental business, having spent much of the previous two\nyears investigating it.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f5n\"><font color=\"#000000\">5</font></a>]\nI calculated it once for the last batch before a consortium of\ninvestors started offering investment automatically to every startup\nwe funded, summer 2010.  At the time it was 94% (33 of 35 companies\nthat tried to raise money succeeded, and one didn't try because\nthey were already profitable).  Presumably it's lower now because\nof that investment; in the old days it was raise after Demo Day or\ndie.<br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Patrick Collison, Jessica\nLivingston, Geoff Ralston, and Harj Taggar for reading drafts of\nthis.<br/><br/></br></p></font>","date":"2012-09-01T00:00:00Z"}
