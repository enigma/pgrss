{"href":"woke.html","title":"The Origins of Wokeness","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">January 2025<br/><br/>The word \"prig\" isn't very common now, but if you look up\nthe definition, it will sound familiar. Google's isn't bad:\n<blockquote>\n  A self-righteously moralistic person who behaves as if\n  superior to others.\n</blockquote>\nThis sense of the word originated in the 18th century, and\nits age is an important clue: it shows that although\nwokeness is a comparatively recent phenomenon, it's an\ninstance of a much older one.<br/><br/>There's a certain kind of person who's attracted to a\nshallow, exacting kind of moral purity, and who demonstrates\nhis purity by attacking anyone who breaks the rules. Every\nsociety has these people. All that changes is the rules they\nenforce. In Victorian England it was Christian virtue. In\nStalin's Russia it was orthodox Marxism-Leninism. For the\nwoke, it's social justice.<br/><br/>So if you want to understand wokeness, the question to ask\nis not why people behave this way. Every society has prigs.\nThe question to ask is why our prigs are priggish about\nthese ideas, at this moment. And to answer that we have to\nask when and where wokeness began.<br/><br/>The answer to the first question is the 1980s. Wokeness is a\nsecond, more aggressive wave of political correctness, which\nstarted in the late 1980s, died down in the late 1990s, and\nthen returned with a vengeance in the early 2010s, finally\npeaking after the riots of 2020.<br/><br/>This was not the original meaning of \"woke,\" but it's rarely\nused in the original sense now. Now the pejorative sense is\nthe dominant one. What <i>does</i> it mean now? I've often been\nasked to define both wokeness and political correctness by\npeople who think they're meaningless labels, so I will. They\nboth have the same definition:\n<blockquote>\n  An aggressively performative focus on social justice.\n</blockquote>\nIn other words, it's people being prigs about social\njustice. And that's the real problem — the\nperformativeness, not the social justice.<br/><br/>Racism, for example, is a genuine problem. Not a problem on\nthe scale that the woke believe it to be, but a genuine one.\nI don't think any reasonable person would deny that. The\nproblem with political correctness was not that it focused\non marginalized groups, but the shallow, aggressive way in\nwhich it did so. Instead of going out into the world and\nquietly helping members of marginalized groups, the\npolitically correct focused on getting people in trouble for\nusing the wrong words to talk about them.<br/><br/>As for where political correctness began, if you think about\nit, you probably already know the answer. Did it begin\noutside universities and spread to them from this external\nsource? Obviously not; it has always been most extreme in\nuniversities. So where in universities did it begin? Did it\nbegin in math, or the hard sciences, or engineering, and\nspread from there to the humanities and social sciences?\nThose are amusing images, but no, obviously it began in the\nhumanities and social sciences.<br/><br/>Why there? And why then? What happened in the humanities and\nsocial sciences in the 1980s?<br/><br/>A successful theory of the origin of political correctness\nhas to be able to explain why it didn't happen earlier. Why\ndidn't it happen during the protest movements of the 1960s,\nfor example? They were concerned with much the same issues.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#f1n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The reason the student protests of the 1960s didn't lead to\npolitical correctness was precisely that — they were\nstudent movements. They didn't have any real power. The\nstudents may have been talking a lot about women's\nliberation and black power, but it was not what they were\nbeing taught in their classes. Not yet.<br/><br/>But in the early 1970s the student protestors of the 1960s\nbegan to finish their dissertations and get hired as\nprofessors. At first they were neither powerful nor\nnumerous. But as more of their peers joined them and the\nprevious generation of professors started to retire, they\ngradually became both.<br/><br/>The reason political correctness began in the humanities and\nsocial sciences was that these fields offered more scope for\nthe injection of politics. A 1960s radical who got a job as\na physics professor could still attend protests, but his\npolitical beliefs wouldn't affect his work. Whereas research\nin sociology and modern literature can be made as political\nas you like.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#f2n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>I saw political correctness arise. When I started college in\n1982 it was not yet a thing. Female students might object if\nsomeone said something they considered sexist, but no one\nwas getting <i>reported</i> for it. It was still not a thing when\nI started grad school in 1986. It was definitely a thing in\n1988 though, and by the early 1990s it seemed to pervade\ncampus life.<br/><br/>What happened? How did protest become punishment? Why were\nthe late 1980s the point at which protests against male\nchauvinism (as it used to be called) morphed into formal\ncomplaints to university authorities about sexism?\nBasically, the 1960s radicals got tenure. They became the\nEstablishment they'd protested against two decades before.\nNow they were in a position not just to speak out about\ntheir ideas, but to enforce them.<br/><br/>A new set of moral rules to enforce was exciting news to a\ncertain kind of student. What made it particularly exciting\nwas that they were allowed to attack professors. I remember\nnoticing that aspect of political correctness at the time.\nIt wasn't simply a grass-roots student movement. It was\nfaculty members encouraging students to attack other faculty\nmembers. In that respect it was like the Cultural\nRevolution. That wasn't a grass-roots movement either; that\nwas Mao unleashing the younger generation on his political\nopponents. And in fact when Roderick MacFarquhar started\nteaching a class on the Cultural Revolution at Harvard in\nthe late 1980s, many saw it as a comment on current events.\nI don't know if it actually was, but people thought it was,\nand that means the similarities were obvious.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#f3n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">3</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>College students larp. It's their nature. It's usually\nharmless. But larping morality turned out to be a poisonous\ncombination. The result was a kind of moral etiquette,\nsuperficial but very complicated. Imagine having to explain\nto a well-meaning visitor from another planet why using the\nphrase \"people of color\" is considered particularly\nenlightened, but saying \"colored people\" gets you fired. And\nwhy exactly one isn't supposed to use the word \"negro\" now,\neven though Martin Luther King used it constantly in his\nspeeches. There are no underlying principles. You'd just\nhave to give him a long list of rules to memorize.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#f4n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">4</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>\nThe danger of these rules was not just that they created\nland mines for the unwary, but that their elaborateness made\nthem an effective substitute for virtue. Whenever a society\nhas a concept of heresy and orthodoxy, orthodoxy becomes a\nsubstitute for virtue. You can be the worst person in the\nworld, but as long as you're orthodox you're better than\neveryone who isn't. This makes orthodoxy very attractive to\nbad people.<br/><br/>But for it to work as a substitute for virtue, orthodoxy\nmust be difficult. If all you have to do to be orthodox is\nwear some garment or avoid saying some word, everyone knows\nto do it, and the only way to seem more virtuous than other\npeople is to actually be virtuous. The shallow, complicated,\nand frequently changing rules of political correctness made\nit the perfect substitute for actual virtue. And the result\nwas a world in which good people who weren't up to date on\ncurrent moral fashions were brought down by people whose\ncharacters would make you recoil in horror if you could see\nthem.<br/><br/>One big contributing factor in the rise of political\ncorrectness was the lack of other things to be morally pure\nabout. Previous generations of prigs had been prigs mostly\nabout religion and sex. But among the cultural elite these\nwere the deadest of dead letters by the 1980s; if you were\nreligious, or a virgin, this was something you tended to\nconceal rather than advertise. So the sort of people who\nenjoy being moral enforcers had become starved of things to\nenforce. A new set of rules was just what they'd been\nwaiting for.<br/><br/>Curiously enough, the tolerant side of the 1960s left helped\ncreate the conditions in which the intolerant side\nprevailed. The relaxed social rules advocated by the old,\neasy-going hippy left became the dominant ones, at least\namong the elite, and this left nothing for the naturally\nintolerant to be intolerant about.<br/><br/>Another possibly contributing factor was the fall of the\nSoviet empire. Marxism had been a popular focus of moral\npurity on the left before political correctness emerged as a\ncompetitor, but the pro-democracy movements in Eastern Bloc\ncountries took most of the shine off it. Especially the fall\nof the Berlin Wall in 1989. You couldn't be on the side of\nthe Stasi. I remember looking at the moribund Soviet Studies\nsection of a used bookshop in Cambridge in the late 1980s\nand thinking \"what will those people go on about now?\" As it\nturned out the answer was right under my nose.<br/><br/>One thing I noticed at the time about the first phase of\npolitical correctness was that it was more popular with\nwomen than men. As many writers (perhaps most eloquently\nGeorge Orwell) have observed, women seem more attracted than\nmen to the idea of being moral enforcers. But there was\nanother more specific reason women tended to be the\nenforcers of political correctness. There was at this time a\ngreat backlash against sexual harassment; the mid 1980s were\nthe point when the definition of sexual harassment was\nexpanded from explicit sexual advances to creating a\n\"hostile environment.\" Within universities the classic form\nof accusation was for a (female) student to say that a\nprofessor made her \"feel uncomfortable.\" But the vagueness\nof this accusation allowed the radius of forbidden behavior\nto expand to include talking about heterodox ideas. Those\nmake people uncomfortable too.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#f5n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">5</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Was it sexist to propose that Darwin's greater male\nvariability hypothesis might explain some variation in human\nperformance? Sexist enough to get Larry Summers pushed out\nas president of Harvard, apparently. One woman who heard the\ntalk in which he mentioned this idea said it made her feel\n\"physically ill\" and that she had to leave halfway through.\nIf the test of a hostile environment is how it makes people\nfeel, this certainly sounds like one. And yet it does seem\nplausible that greater male variability explains some of the\nvariation in human performance. So which should prevail,\ncomfort or truth? Surely if truth should prevail anywhere,\nit should be in universities; that's supposed to be their\nspecialty; but for decades starting in the late 1980s the\npolitically correct tried to pretend this conflict didn't\nexist.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#f6n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">6</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Political correctness seemed to burn out in the second half\nof the 1990s. One reason, perhaps the main reason, was that\nit literally became a joke. It offered rich material for\ncomedians, who performed their usual disinfectant action\nupon it. Humor is one of the most powerful weapons against\npriggishness of any sort, because prigs, being humorless,\ncan't respond in kind. Humor was what defeated Victorian\nprudishness, and by 2000 it seemed to have done the same\nthing to political correctness.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this was an illusion. Within universities the\nembers of political correctness were still glowing brightly.\nAfter all, the forces that created it were still there. The\nprofessors who started it were now becoming deans and\ndepartment heads. And in addition to their departments there\nwere now a bunch of new ones explicitly focused on social\njustice. Students were still hungry for things to be morally\npure about. And there had been an explosion in the number of\nuniversity administrators, many of whose jobs involved\nenforcing various forms of political correctness.<br/><br/>In the early 2010s the embers of political correctness burst\ninto flame anew. There were several differences between this\nnew phase and the original one. It was more virulent. It\nspread further into the real world, although it still burned\nhottest within universities. And it was concerned with a\nwider variety of sins. In the first phase of political\ncorrectness there were really only three things people got\naccused of: sexism, racism, and homophobia (which at the\ntime was a neologism invented for the purpose). But between\nthen and 2010 a lot of people had spent a lot of time trying\nto invent new kinds of -isms and -phobias and seeing which\ncould be made to stick.<br/><br/>The second phase was, in multiple senses, political\ncorrectness metastasized. Why did it happen when it did? My\nguess is that it was due to the rise of social media,\nparticularly Tumblr and Twitter, because one of the most\ndistinctive features of the second wave of political\ncorrectness was the <i>cancel mob</i>: a mob of angry people\nuniting on social media to get someone ostracized or fired.\nIndeed this second wave of political correctness was\noriginally called \"cancel culture\"; it didn't start to be\ncalled \"wokeness\" till the 2020s.<br/><br/>One aspect of social media that surprised almost everyone at\nfirst was the popularity of outrage. Users seemed to <i>like</i>\nbeing outraged. We're so used to this idea now that we take\nit for granted, but really it's pretty strange. Being\noutraged is not a pleasant feeling. You wouldn't expect\npeople to seek it out. But they do. And above all, they want\nto share it. I happened to be running a forum from 2007 to\n2014, so I can actually quantify how much they want to share\nit: our users were about three times more likely to upvote\nsomething if it outraged them.<br/><br/>This tilt toward outrage wasn't due to wokeness. It's an\ninherent feature of social media, or at least this\ngeneration of it. But it did make social media the perfect\nmechanism for fanning the flames of wokeness.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#f7n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">7</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>It wasn't just public social networks that drove the rise of\nwokeness though. Group chat apps were also critical,\nespecially in the final step, cancellation. Imagine if a\ngroup of employees trying to get someone fired had to do it\nusing only email. It would be hard to organize a mob. But\nonce you have group chat, mobs form naturally.<br/><br/>Another contributing factor in this second wave of political\ncorrectness was the dramatic increase in the polarization of\nthe press. In the print era, newspapers were constrained to\nbe, or at least seem, politically neutral. The department\nstores that ran ads in the New York Times wanted to reach\neveryone in the region, both liberal and conservative, so\nthe Times had to serve both. But the Times didn't regard\nthis neutrality as something forced upon them. They embraced\nit as their duty as a <i>paper of record</i> — as one of the big\nnewspapers that aimed to be chronicles of their times,\nreporting every sufficiently important story from a neutral\npoint of view.<br/><br/>When I grew up the papers of record seemed timeless, almost\nsacred institutions. Papers like the New York Times and\nWashington Post had immense prestige, partly because other\nsources of news were limited, but also because they did make\nsome effort to be neutral.<br/><br/>Unfortunately it turned out that the paper of record was\nmostly an artifact of the constraints imposed by print.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#f8n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">8</font></a>]</font>\nWhen your market was determined by geography, you had\nto be neutral. But publishing online enabled — in fact\nprobably forced — newspapers to switch to serving markets\ndefined by ideology instead of geography. Most that remained\nin business fell in the direction they'd already been\nleaning: left. On October 11, 2020 the New York Times\nannounced that \"The paper is in the midst of an evolution\nfrom the stodgy paper of record into a juicy collection of\ngreat narratives.\"\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#f9n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">9</font></a>]</font>\nMeanwhile journalists, of a sort,\nhad arisen to serve the right as well. And so journalism,\nwhich in the previous era had been one of the great\ncentralizing forces, now became one of the great polarizing\nones.<br/><br/>The rise of social media and the increasing polarization of\njournalism reinforced one another. In fact there arose a new\nvariety of journalism involving a loop through social media.\nSomeone would say something controversial on social media.\nWithin hours it would become a news story. Outraged readers\nwould then post links to the story on social media, driving\nfurther arguments online. It was the cheapest source of\nclicks imaginable. You didn't have to maintain overseas news\nbureaus or pay for month-long investigations. All you had to\ndo was watch Twitter for controversial remarks and repost\nthem on your site, with some additional comments to inflame\nreaders further.<br/><br/>For the press there was money in wokeness. But they weren't\nthe only ones. That was one of the biggest differences\nbetween the two waves of political correctness: the first\nwas driven almost entirely by amateurs, but the second was\noften driven by professionals. For some it was their whole\njob. By 2010 a new class of administrators had arisen whose\njob was basically to enforce wokeness. They played a role\nsimilar to that of the political commissars who got attached\nto military and industrial organizations in the USSR: they\nweren't directly in the flow of the organization's work, but\nwatched from the side to ensure that nothing improper\nhappened in the doing of it. These new administrators could\noften be recognized by the word \"inclusion\" in their titles.\nWithin institutions this was the preferred euphemism for\nwokeness; a new list of banned words, for example, would\nusually be called an \"inclusive language guide.\"\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#f10n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">10</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>This new class of bureaucrats pursued a woke agenda as if\ntheir jobs depended on it, because they did. If you hire\npeople to keep watch for a particular type of problem,\nthey're going to find it, because otherwise there's no\njustification for their existence.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#f11n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">11</font></a>]</font>\nBut these\nbureaucrats also represented a second and possibly even\ngreater danger. Many were involved in hiring, and when\npossible they tried to ensure their employers hired only\npeople who shared their political beliefs. The most\negregious cases were the new \"DEI statements\" that some\nuniversities started to require from faculty candidates,\nproving their commitment to wokeness. Some universities used\nthese statements as the initial filter and only even\nconsidered candidates who scored high enough on them. You're\nnot hiring Einstein that way; imagine what you get instead.<br/><br/>Another factor in the rise of wokeness was the Black Lives\nMatter movement, which started in 2013 when a white man was\nacquitted after killing a black teenager in Florida. But\nthis didn't launch wokeness; it was well underway by 2013.<br/><br/>Similarly for the Me Too Movement, which took off in 2017\nafter the first news stories about Harvey Weinstein's\nhistory of raping women. It accelerated wokeness, but didn't\nplay the same role in launching it that the 80s version did\nin launching political correctness.<br/><br/>The election of Donald Trump in 2016 also accelerated\nwokeness, particularly in the press, where outrage now meant\ntraffic. Trump made the New York Times a lot of money:\nheadlines during his first administration mentioned his name\nat about four times the rate of previous presidents.<br/><br/>In 2020 we saw the biggest accelerant of all, after a white\npolice officer asphyxiated a black suspect on video. At this\npoint the metaphorical fire became a literal one, as violent\nprotests broke out across America. But in retrospect this\nturned out to be peak woke, or close to it. By every measure\nI've seen, wokeness peaked in 2020 or 2021.<br/><br/>Wokeness is sometimes described as a mind-virus. What makes\nit viral is that it defines new types of impropriety. Most\npeople are afraid of impropriety; they're never exactly sure\nwhat the social rules are or which ones they might be\nbreaking. Especially if the rules change rapidly. And since\nmost people already worry that they might be breaking rules\nthey don't know about, if you tell them they're breaking a\nrule, their default reaction is to believe you. Especially\nif multiple people tell them. Which in turn is a recipe for\nexponential growth. Zealots invent some new impropriety to\navoid. The first people to adopt it are fellow zealots,\neager for new ways to signal their virtue. If there are\nenough of these, the initial group of zealots is followed by\na much larger group, motivated by fear. They're not trying\nto signal virtue; they're just trying to avoid getting in\ntrouble. At this point the new impropriety is now firmly\nestablished. Plus its success has increased the rate of\nchange in social rules, which, remember, is one of the\nreasons people are nervous about which rules they might be\nbreaking. So the cycle accelerates.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#f12n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">12</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>What's true of individuals is even more true of\norganizations. Especially organizations without a powerful\nleader. Such organizations do everything based on \"best\npractices.\" There's no higher authority; if some new \"best\npractice\" achieves critical mass, they <i>must</i> adopt it. And\nin this case the organization can't do what it usually does\nwhen it's uncertain: delay. It might be committing\nimproprieties right now! So it's surprisingly easy for a\nsmall group of zealots to capture this type of organization\nby describing new improprieties it might be guilty of. \n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#f13n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">13</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>How does this kind of cycle ever end? Eventually it leads to\ndisaster, and people start to say enough is enough. The\nexcesses of 2020 made a lot of people say that.<br/><br/>Since then wokeness has been in gradual but continual\nretreat. Corporate CEOs, starting with Brian Armstrong, have\nopenly rejected it. Universities, led by the University of\nChicago and MIT, have explicitly confirmed their commitment\nto free speech. Twitter, which was arguably the hub of\nwokeness, was bought by Elon Musk in order to neutralize it,\nand he seems to have succeeded — and not, incidentally, by\ncensoring left-wing users the way Twitter used to censor\nright-wing ones, but without censoring either.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#f14n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">14</font></a>]</font>\nConsumers have emphatically rejected brands that ventured\ntoo far into wokeness. The Bud Light brand may have been\npermanently damaged by it. I'm not going to claim Trump's\nsecond victory in 2024 was a referendum on wokeness; I think\nhe won, as presidential candidates always do, because he was\nmore <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/charisma.html\"><u>charismatic</u></a>; but voters' \ndisgust with wokeness must have helped.<br/><br/>So what do we do now? Wokeness is already in retreat.\nObviously we should help it along. What's the best way to do\nthat? And more importantly, how do we avoid a third\noutbreak? After all, it seemed to be dead once, but came\nback worse than ever.<br/><br/>In fact there's an even more ambitious goal: is there a way\nto prevent any similar outbreak of aggressively performative\nmoralism in the future — not just a third outbreak of\npolitical correctness, but the next thing like it? Because\nthere will be a next thing. Prigs are prigs by nature. They\nneed rules to obey and enforce, and now that Darwin has cut\noff their traditional supply of rules, they're constantly\nhungry for new ones. All they need is someone to meet them\nhalfway by defining a new way to be morally pure, and we'll\nsee the same phenomenon again.<br/><br/>Let's start with the easier problem. Is there a simple,\nprincipled way to deal with wokeness? I think there is: to\nuse the customs we already have for dealing with religion.\nWokeness is effectively a religion, just with God replaced\nby protected classes. It's not even the first religion of\nthis kind; Marxism had a similar form, with God replaced by\nthe masses.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#f15n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">15</font></a>]</font>\nAnd we already have well-established\ncustoms for dealing with religion within organizations. You\ncan express your own religious identity and explain your\nbeliefs, but you can't call your coworkers infidels if they\ndisagree, or try to ban them from saying things that\ncontradict its doctrines, or insist that the organization\nadopt yours as its official religion.<br/><br/>If we're not sure what to do about any particular\nmanifestation of wokeness, imagine we were dealing with some\nother religion, like Christianity. Should we have people\nwithin organizations whose jobs are to enforce woke\northodoxy? No, because we wouldn't have people whose jobs\nwere to enforce Christian orthodoxy. Should we censor\n<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/02/17/roald-dahl-books-rewritten-offensive-matilda-witches-twits/\"><u>writers</u></a> or \n<a href=\"https://x.com/KoustaStavroula/status/1562034502897106946\"><u>scientists</u></a> whose work contradicts woke doctrines?\nNo, because we wouldn't do this to people whose work\ncontradicted Christian teachings. Should job candidates be\nrequired to write DEI statements? Of course not; imagine an\nemployer requiring proof of one's religious beliefs. Should\nstudents and employees have to participate in woke\nindoctrination sessions in which they're required to answer\nquestions about their beliefs to ensure compliance? No,\nbecause we wouldn't dream of catechizing people in this way\nabout their religion.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#f16n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">16</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>One shouldn't feel bad about not wanting to watch woke\nmovies any more than one would feel bad about not wanting to\nlisten to Christian rock. In my twenties I drove across\nAmerica several times, listening to local radio stations.\nOccasionally I'd turn the dial and hear some new song. But\nthe moment anyone mentioned Jesus I'd turn the dial again.\nEven the tiniest bit of being preached to was enough to make\nme lose interest.<br/><br/>But by the same token we should not automatically reject\neverything the woke believe. I'm not a Christian, but I can\nsee that many Christian principles are good ones. It would\nbe a mistake to discard them all just because one didn't\nshare the religion that espoused them. It would be the sort\nof thing a religious zealot would do.<br/><br/>If we have genuine pluralism, I think we'll be safe from\nfuture outbreaks of woke intolerance. Wokeness itself won't\ngo away. There will for the foreseeable future continue to\nbe pockets of woke zealots inventing new moral fashions. The\nkey is not to let them treat their fashions as normative.\nThey can change what their coreligionists are allowed to say\nevery few months if they like, but they mustn't be allowed\nto change what we're allowed to say.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#f17n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">17</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The more general problem — how to prevent similar outbreaks\nof aggressively performative moralism — is of course\nharder. Here we're up against human nature. There will\nalways be prigs. And in particular there will always be the\nenforcers among them, the \n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/conformism.html\"><u>aggressively conventional-minded</u></a>.\nThese people are born that way. Every society has them. So\nthe best we can do is to keep them bottled up.<br/><br/>The aggressively conventional-minded aren't always on the\nrampage. Usually they just enforce whatever random rules are\nnearest to hand. They only become dangerous when some new\nideology gets a lot of them pointed in the same direction at\nonce. That's what happened during the Cultural Revolution,\nand to a lesser extent (thank God) in the two waves of\npolitical correctness we've experienced.<br/><br/>We can't get rid of the aggressively conventional-minded.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/woke.html#f18n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">18</font></a>]</font>\nAnd we couldn't prevent people from creating new\nideologies that appealed to them even if we wanted to. So if\nwe want to keep them bottled up, we have to do it one step\ndownstream. Fortunately when the aggressively\nconventional-minded go on the rampage they always do one\nthing that gives them away: they define new <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/heresy.html\"><u>heresies</u></a> to\npunish people for. So the best way to protect ourselves from\nfuture outbreaks of things like wokeness is to have powerful\nantibodies against the concept of heresy.<br/><br/>We should have a conscious bias against defining new forms\nof heresy. Whenever anyone tries to ban saying something\nthat we'd previously been able to say, our initial\nassumption should be that they're wrong. Only our initial\nassumption of course. If they can prove we should stop\nsaying it, then we should. But the burden of proof is on\nthem. In liberal democracies, people trying to prevent\nsomething from being said will usually claim they're not\nmerely engaging in censorship, but trying to prevent some\nform of \"harm\". And maybe they're right. But once again, the\nburden of proof is on them. It's not enough to claim harm;\nthey have to prove it.<br/><br/>As long as the aggressively conventional-minded continue to\ngive themselves away by banning heresies, we'll always be\nable to notice when they become aligned behind some new\nideology. And if we always fight back at that point, with\nany luck we can stop them in their tracks.<br/><br/>The number of true things we <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/say.html\"><u>can't say</u></a>\nshould not increase. If it does, something is wrong.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nWhy did 1960s radicals focus on the causes they did?\nOne of the people who reviewed drafts of this essay\nexplained this so well that I asked if I could quote him:\n<blockquote>\n  The middle-class student protestors of the New Left\n  rejected the socialist/Marxist left as unhip. They were\n  interested in sexier forms of oppression uncovered by\n  cultural analysis (Marcuse) and abstruse \"Theory\". Labor\n  politics became stodgy and old-fashioned. This took a\n  couple generations to work through. The woke ideology's\n  conspicuous lack of interest in the working class is the\n  tell-tale sign. Such fragments as are, er, left of the old\n  left are anti-woke, and meanwhile the actual working class\n  shifted to the populist right and gave us Trump. Trump and\n  wokeness are cousins.<br/><br/>The middle-class origins of wokeness smoothed its way\n  through the institutions because it had no interest in\n  \"seizing the means of production\" (how quaint such phrases\n  seem now), which would quickly have run up against hard\n  state and corporate power. The fact that wokeness only\n  expressed interest in other kinds of class (race, sex,\n  etc) signalled compromise with existing power: give us\n  power within your system and we'll bestow the resource we\n  control — moral rectitude — upon you. As an ideological\n  stalking horse for gaining control over discourse and\n  institutions, this succeeded where a more ambitious\n  revolutionary program would not have.\n</blockquote>\n[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nIt helped that the humanities and social sciences also\nincluded some of the biggest and easiest undergrad majors.\nIf a political movement had to start with physics students,\nit could never get off the ground; there would be too few of\nthem, and they wouldn't have the time to spare.<br/><br/>At the top universities these majors are not as big as they\nused to be, though. A \n<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/03/06/the-end-of-the-english-major\"><u>2022 survey</u></a> found that only 7% of\nHarvard undergrads plan to major in the humanities, vs\nnearly 30% during the 1970s. I expect wokeness is at least\npart of the reason; when undergrads consider majoring in\nEnglish, it's presumably because they love the written word\nand not because they want to listen to lectures about\nracism.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nThe puppet-master-and-puppet character of political\ncorrectness became clearly visible when a bakery near\nOberlin College was falsely accused of race discrimination\nin 2016. In the subsequent civil trial, lawyers for the\nbakery produced a text message from Oberlin Dean of Students\nMeredith Raimondo that read \"I'd say unleash the students if\nI wasn't convinced this needs to be put behind us.\"<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f4n\"><font color=\"#000000\">4</font></a>]\nThe woke sometimes claim that wokeness is simply\ntreating people with respect. But if it were, that would be\nthe only rule you'd have to remember, and this is comically\nfar from being the case. My younger son likes to imitate\nvoices, and at one point when he was about seven I had to\nexplain which accents it was currently safe to imitate\npublicly and which not. It took about ten minutes, and I\nstill hadn't covered all the cases.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f5n\"><font color=\"#000000\">5</font></a>]\nIn 1986 the Supreme Court ruled that creating a\nhostile work environment could constitute sex\ndiscrimination, which in turn affected universities via\nTitle IX. The court specified that the test of a hostile\nenvironment was whether it would bother a reasonable person,\nbut since for a professor merely being the subject of a\nsexual harassment complaint would be a disaster whether the\ncomplainant was reasonable or not, in practice any joke or\nremark remotely connected with sex was now effectively\nforbidden. Which meant we'd now come full circle to\nVictorian codes of behavior, when there was a large class of\nthings that might not be said \"with ladies present.\"<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f6n\"><font color=\"#000000\">6</font></a>]\nMuch as they tried to pretend there was no conflict\nbetween diversity and quality. But you can't simultaneously\noptimize for two things that aren't identical. What\ndiversity actually means, judging from the way the term is\nused, is proportional representation, and unless you're\nselecting a group whose purpose is to be representative,\nlike poll respondents, optimizing for proportional\nrepresentation has to come at the expense of quality. This\nis not because of anything about representation; it's the\nnature of optimization; optimizing for x has to come at the\nexpense of y unless x and y are identical.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f7n\"><font color=\"#000000\">7</font></a>]\nMaybe societies will eventually develop antibodies to\nviral outrage. Maybe we were just the first to be exposed to\nit, so it tore through us like an epidemic through a\npreviously isolated population. I'm fairly confident that it\nwould be possible to create new social media apps that were\nless driven by outrage, and an app of this type would have a\ngood chance of stealing users from existing ones, because\nthe smartest people would tend to migrate to it.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f8n\"><font color=\"#000000\">8</font></a>]\nI say \"mostly\" because I have hopes that journalistic\nneutrality will return in some form. There is some market\nfor unbiased news, and while it may be small, it's valuable.\nThe rich and powerful want to know what's really going on;\nthat's how they became rich and powerful.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f9n\"><font color=\"#000000\">9</font></a>]\nThe Times made this momentous announcement very\ninformally, in passing in the middle of an \n<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/11/business/media/new-york-times-rukmini-callimachi-caliphate.html\"><u>article</u></a> about a\nTimes reporter who'd been criticized for inaccuracy. It's\nquite possible no senior editor even approved it. But it's\nsomehow appropriate that this particular universe ended with\na whimper rather than a bang.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f10n\"><font color=\"#000000\">10</font></a>]\nAs the acronym DEI goes out of fashion, many of these\nbureaucrats will try to go underground by changing their\ntitles. It looks like \"belonging\" will be a popular option.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f11n\"><font color=\"#000000\">11</font></a>]\nIf you've ever wondered why our legal system includes\nprotections like the separation of prosecutor, judge, and\njury, the right to examine evidence and cross-examine\nwitnesses, and the right to be represented by legal counsel,\nthe de facto \n<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/magazine/title-ix-sexual-harassment-accusations.html\">parallel legal system</a>\nestablished by Title IX\nmakes that all too clear.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f12n\"><font color=\"#000000\">12</font></a>]\nThe invention of new improprieties is most visible in\nthe rapid evolution of woke nomenclature. This is\nparticularly annoying to me as a writer, because the new\nnames are always worse. Any religious observance has to be\ninconvenient and slightly absurd; otherwise gentiles would\ndo it too. So \"slaves\" becomes \"enslaved individuals.\" But\nweb search can show us the leading edge of moral growth in\nreal time: if you search for \"individuals experiencing\nslavery\" you will as of this writing find five legit\nattempts to use the phrase, and you'll even find two for\n\"individuals experiencing enslavement.\"<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f13n\"><font color=\"#000000\">13</font></a>]\nOrganizations that do dubious things are particularly\nconcerned with propriety, which is how you end up with\nabsurdities like tobacco and oil companies having higher ESG\nratings than Tesla.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f14n\"><font color=\"#000000\">14</font></a>]\nElon did something else that tilted Twitter rightward\nthough: he gave more visibility to paying users. Paying\nusers lean right on average, because people on the far left\ndislike Elon and don't want to give him money. Elon\npresumably knew this would happen. On the other hand, the\npeople on the far left have only themselves to blame; they\ncould tilt Twitter back to the left tomorrow if they wanted\nto.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f15n\"><font color=\"#000000\">15</font></a>]\nIt even, as James Lindsay and Peter Boghossian\npointed out, has a concept of original sin: privilege. Which\nmeans unlike Christianity's egalitarian version, people have varying\ndegrees of it. An able-bodied straight white\nAmerican male is born with such a load of sin that only by\nthe most abject repentance can he be saved.<br/><br/>Wokeness also shares something rather funny with many actual\nversions of Christianity: like God, the people for whose\nsake wokeness purports to act are often revolted by the\nthings done in their name.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f16n\"><font color=\"#000000\">16</font></a>]\nThere is one exception to most of these rules: actual\nreligious organizations. It's reasonable for them to insist\non orthodoxy. But they in turn should declare that they're\nreligious organizations. It's rightly considered shady\nwhen something that appears to be an ordinary business or\npublication turns out to be a religious organization.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f17n\"><font color=\"#000000\">17</font></a>]\nI don't want to give the impression that it will be\nsimple to roll back wokeness. There will be places where the\nfight inevitably gets messy — particularly within\nuniversities, which everyone has to share, yet which are\ncurrently the most pervaded by wokeness of any institutions.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f18n\"><font color=\"#000000\">18</font></a>]\nYou can however get rid of aggressively\nconventional-minded people within an organization, and in\nmany if not most organizations this would be an excellent\nidea. Even a handful of them can do a lot of damage. I bet\nyou'd feel a noticeable improvement going from a handful to\nnone.<br/><br/><br/><br/><font color=\"888888\"><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, \nBen Miller, Daniel Gackle, Robin Hanson, Jessica\nLivingston, Greg Lukianoff, Harj Taggar, Garry Tan, and Tim\nUrban for reading drafts of this.</font><br/><br/></font>","date":"2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
