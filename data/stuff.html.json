{"href":"stuff.html","title":"Stuff","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">July 2007<br/><br/>I have too much stuff.  Most people in America do.  In fact, the\npoorer people are, the more stuff they seem to have.  Hardly anyone\nis so poor that they can't afford a front yard full of old cars.<br/><br/>It wasn't always this way.  Stuff used to be rare and valuable.\nYou can still see evidence of that if you look for it.  For example,\nin my house in Cambridge, which was built in 1876, the bedrooms\ndon't have closets.  In those days people's stuff fit in a chest\nof drawers.  Even as recently as a few decades ago there was a lot\nless stuff.  When I look back at photos from the 1970s, I'm surprised\nhow empty houses look.  As a kid I had what I thought was a huge\nfleet of toy cars, but they'd be dwarfed by the number of toys my\nnephews have.  All together my Matchboxes and Corgis took up about\na third of the surface of my bed.  In my nephews' rooms the bed is\nthe only clear space.<br/><br/>Stuff has gotten a lot cheaper, but our attitudes toward it haven't\nchanged correspondingly.  We overvalue stuff.<br/><br/>That was a big problem\nfor me when I had no money.  I felt poor, and stuff seemed valuable,\nso almost instinctively I accumulated it.  Friends would leave\nsomething behind when they moved, or I'd see something as I was\nwalking down the street on trash night (beware of anything you find\nyourself describing as \"perfectly good\"), or I'd find something in\nalmost new condition for a tenth its retail price at a garage sale.\nAnd pow, more stuff.<br/><br/>In fact these free or nearly free things weren't bargains, because\nthey were worth even less than they cost.  Most of the stuff I\naccumulated was worthless, because I didn't need it.<br/><br/>What I didn't understand was that the value of some new acquisition\nwasn't the difference between its retail price and what I paid for\nit.  It was the value I derived from it.  Stuff is an extremely\nilliquid asset.  Unless you have some plan for selling that valuable\nthing you got so cheaply, what difference does it make what it's\n\"worth?\"  The only way you're ever going to extract any value from\nit is to use it.  And if you don't have any immediate use for it,\nyou probably never will.<br/><br/>Companies that sell stuff have spent huge sums training us to think\nstuff is still valuable.  But it would be closer to the truth to\ntreat stuff as worthless.<br/><br/>In fact, worse than worthless, because once you've accumulated a\ncertain amount of stuff, it starts to own you rather than the other\nway around.  I know of one couple who couldn't retire to the town\nthey preferred because they couldn't afford a place there big enough\nfor all their stuff.  Their house isn't theirs; it's their stuff's.<br/><br/>And unless you're extremely organized, a house full of stuff can\nbe very depressing. A cluttered room saps one's spirits.  One\nreason, obviously, is that there's less room for people in a room\nfull of stuff.  But there's more going on than that.  I think humans\nconstantly scan their environment to build a mental model of what's\naround them.  And the harder a scene is to parse, the less energy\nyou have left for conscious thoughts.  A cluttered room is literally\nexhausting.<br/><br/>(This could explain why clutter doesn't seem to bother kids as much\nas adults. Kids are less perceptive.  They build a coarser model\nof their surroundings, and this consumes less energy.)<br/><br/>I first realized the worthlessness of stuff when I lived in Italy\nfor a year.  All I took with me was one large backpack of stuff.\nThe rest of my stuff I left in my landlady's attic back in the US.\nAnd you know what?  All I missed were some of the books.  By the\nend of the year I couldn't even remember what else I had stored in\nthat attic.<br/><br/>And yet when I got back I didn't discard so much as a box of it.\nThrow away a perfectly good rotary telephone?  I might need that\none day.<br/><br/>The really painful thing to recall is not just that I accumulated\nall this useless stuff, but that I often spent money I desperately\nneeded on stuff that I didn't.<br/><br/>Why would I do that?  Because the people whose job is to sell you\nstuff are really, really good at it.  The average 25 year old is\nno match for companies that have spent years figuring out how to\nget you to spend money on stuff.  They make the experience of buying\nstuff so pleasant that \"shopping\" becomes a leisure activity.<br/><br/>How do you protect yourself from these people?  It can't be easy.\nI'm a fairly skeptical person, and their tricks worked on me well\ninto my thirties.  But one thing that might work is to ask yourself,\nbefore buying something, \"is this going to make my life noticeably\nbetter?\"<br/><br/>A friend of mine cured herself of a clothes buying habit by asking\nherself before she bought anything \"Am I going to wear this all the\ntime?\"  If she couldn't convince herself that something she was\nthinking of buying would become one of those few things she wore\nall the time, she wouldn't buy it.  I think that would work for any\nkind of purchase.  Before you buy anything, ask yourself: will this\nbe something I use constantly?  Or is it just something nice?  Or\nworse still, a mere bargain?<br/><br/>The worst stuff in this respect may be stuff you don't use much\nbecause it's too good.  Nothing owns you like fragile stuff.  For\nexample, the \"good china\" so many households have, and whose defining\nquality is not so much that it's fun to use, but that one must be\nespecially careful not to break it.<br/><br/>Another way to resist acquiring stuff is to think of the overall\ncost of owning it.  The purchase price is just the beginning.  You're\ngoing to have to <i>think</i> about that thing for years—perhaps for\nthe rest of your life.  Every thing you own takes energy away from\nyou.  Some give more than they take.  Those are the only things\nworth having.<br/><br/>I've now stopped accumulating stuff.  Except books—but books are\ndifferent.  Books are more like a fluid than individual objects.\nIt's not especially inconvenient to own several thousand books,\nwhereas if you owned several thousand random possessions you'd be\na local celebrity.  But except for books, I now actively avoid\nstuff.  If I want to spend money on some kind of treat, I'll take\nservices over \ngoods any day.<br/><br/>I'm not claiming this is because I've achieved some kind of zenlike\ndetachment from material things.  I'm talking about something more\nmundane.  A historical change has taken place, and I've now realized\nit.  Stuff used to be valuable, and now it's not.<br/><br/>In industrialized countries the same thing happened with food in\nthe middle of the twentieth century.  As food got cheaper (or we\ngot richer; they're indistinguishable), eating too much started to\nbe a bigger danger than eating too little.   We've now reached that\npoint with stuff.  For most people, rich or poor, stuff has become\na burden.<br/><br/>The good news is, if you're carrying a burden without knowing it,\nyour life could be better than you realize.  Imagine walking around\nfor years with five pound ankle weights, then suddenly having them\nremoved.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<!-- <font color=#666666>Like this?  Leave a tip.
