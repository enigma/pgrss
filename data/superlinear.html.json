{"href":"superlinear.html","title":"Superlinear Returns","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">October 2023<br/><br/>One of the most important things I didn't understand about the world\nwhen I was a child is the degree to which the returns for performance\nare superlinear.<br/><br/>Teachers and coaches implicitly told us the returns were linear.\n\"You get out,\" I heard a thousand times, \"what you put in.\" They\nmeant well, but this is rarely true. If your product is only half\nas good as your competitor's, you don't get half as many customers.\nYou get no customers, and you go out of business.<br/><br/>It's obviously true that the returns for performance are superlinear\nin business. Some think this is a flaw of capitalism, and that if\nwe changed the rules it would stop being true. But superlinear\nreturns for performance are a feature of the world, not an artifact\nof rules we've invented. We see the same pattern in fame, power,\nmilitary victories, knowledge, and even benefit to humanity. In all\nof these, the rich get richer.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"#f1n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>You can't understand the world without understanding the concept\nof superlinear returns. And if you're ambitious you definitely\nshould, because this will be the wave you surf on.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>It may seem as if there are a lot of different situations with\nsuperlinear returns, but as far as I can tell they reduce to two\nfundamental causes: exponential growth and thresholds.<br/><br/>The most obvious case of superlinear returns is when you're working\non something that grows exponentially. For example, growing bacterial\ncultures. When they grow at all, they grow exponentially. But they're\ntricky to grow. Which means the difference in outcome between someone\nwho's adept at it and someone who's not is very great.<br/><br/>Startups can also grow exponentially, and we see the same pattern\nthere. Some manage to achieve high growth rates. Most don't. And\nas a result you get qualitatively different outcomes: the companies\nwith high growth rates tend to become immensely valuable, while the\nones with lower growth rates may not even survive.<br/><br/>Y Combinator encourages founders to focus on growth rate rather\nthan absolute numbers. It prevents them from being discouraged early\non, when the absolute numbers are still low. It also helps them\ndecide what to focus on: you can use growth rate as a compass to\ntell you how to evolve the company. But the main advantage is that\nby focusing on growth rate you tend to get something that grows\nexponentially.<br/><br/>YC doesn't explicitly tell founders that with growth rate \"you get\nout what you put in,\" but it's not far from the truth. And if growth\nrate were proportional to performance, then the reward for performance\n<i>p</i> over time <i>t</i> would be proportional to <i>p<sup>t</sup></i>.<br/><br/>Even after decades of thinking about this, I find that sentence\nstartling.<br/><br/>Whenever how well you do depends on how well you've done, you'll\nget exponential growth. But neither our DNA nor our customs prepare\nus for it. No one finds exponential growth natural; every child is\nsurprised, the first time they hear it, by the story of the man who\nasks the king for a single grain of rice the first day and double\nthe amount each successive day.<br/><br/>What we don't understand naturally we develop customs to deal with,\nbut we don't have many customs about exponential growth either,\nbecause there have been so few instances of it in human history.\nIn principle herding should have been one: the more animals you\nhad, the more offspring they'd have. But in practice grazing land\nwas the limiting factor, and there was no plan for growing that\nexponentially.<br/><br/>Or more precisely, no generally applicable plan. There <i>was</i> a way\nto grow one's territory exponentially: by conquest. The more territory\nyou control, the more powerful your army becomes, and the easier\nit is to conquer new territory. This is why history is full of\nempires. But so few people created or ran empires that their\nexperiences didn't affect customs very much. The emperor was a\nremote and terrifying figure, not a source of lessons one could use\nin one's own life.<br/><br/>The most common case of exponential growth in preindustrial times\nwas probably scholarship. The more you know, the easier it is to\nlearn new things. The result, then as now, was that some people\nwere startlingly more knowledgeable than the rest about certain\ntopics. But this didn't affect customs much either. Although empires\nof ideas can overlap and there can thus be far more emperors, in\npreindustrial times this type of empire had little practical effect.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"#f2n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>That has changed in the last few centuries. Now the emperors of\nideas can design bombs that defeat the emperors of territory. But\nthis phenomenon is still so new that we haven't fully assimilated\nit. Few even of the participants realize they're benefitting from\nexponential growth or ask what they can learn from other instances\nof it.<br/><br/>The other source of superlinear returns is embodied in the expression\n\"winner take all.\" In a sports match the relationship between\nperformance and return is a step function: the winning team gets\none win whether they do much better or just slightly better.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"#f3n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">3</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The source of the step function is not competition per se, however.\nIt's that there are thresholds in the outcome. You don't need\ncompetition to get those. There can be thresholds in situations\nwhere you're the only participant, like proving a theorem or hitting\na target.<br/><br/>It's remarkable how often a situation with one source of superlinear\nreturns also has the other. Crossing thresholds leads to exponential\ngrowth: the winning side in a battle usually suffers less damage,\nwhich makes them more likely to win in the future. And exponential\ngrowth helps you cross thresholds: in a market with network effects,\na company that grows fast enough can shut out potential competitors.<br/><br/>Fame is an interesting example of a phenomenon that combines both\nsources of superlinear returns. Fame grows exponentially because\nexisting fans bring you new ones. But the fundamental reason it's\nso concentrated is thresholds: there's only so much room on the\nA-list in the average person's head.<br/><br/>The most important case combining both sources of superlinear returns\nmay be learning. Knowledge grows exponentially, but there are also\nthresholds in it. Learning to ride a bicycle, for example. Some of\nthese thresholds are akin to machine tools: once you learn to read,\nyou're able to learn anything else much faster. But the most important\nthresholds of all are those representing new discoveries. Knowledge\nseems to be fractal in the sense that if you push hard at the\nboundary of one area of knowledge, you sometimes discover a whole\nnew field. And if you do, you get first crack at all the new\ndiscoveries to be made in it. Newton did this, and so did Durer and\nDarwin.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\nAre there general rules for finding situations with superlinear\nreturns? The most obvious one is to seek work that compounds.<br/><br/>There are two ways work can compound. It can compound directly, in\nthe sense that doing well in one cycle causes you to do better in\nthe next. That happens for example when you're building infrastructure,\nor growing an audience or brand. Or work can compound by teaching\nyou, since learning compounds. This second case is an interesting\none because you may feel you're doing badly as it's happening. You\nmay be failing to achieve your immediate goal. But if you're learning\na lot, then you're getting exponential growth nonetheless.<br/><br/>This is one reason Silicon Valley is so tolerant of failure. People\nin Silicon Valley aren't blindly tolerant of failure. They'll only\ncontinue to bet on you if you're learning from your failures. But\nif you are, you are in fact a good bet: maybe your company didn't\ngrow the way you wanted, but you yourself have, and that should\nyield results eventually.<br/><br/>Indeed, the forms of exponential growth that don't consist of\nlearning are so often intermixed with it that we should probably\ntreat this as the rule rather than the exception. Which yields\nanother heuristic: always be learning. If you're not learning,\nyou're probably not on a path that leads to superlinear returns.<br/><br/>But don't overoptimize <i>what</i> you're learning. Don't limit yourself\nto learning things that are already known to be valuable. You're\nlearning; you don't know for sure yet what's going to be valuable,\nand if you're too strict you'll lop off the outliers.<br/><br/>What about step functions? Are there also useful heuristics of the\nform \"seek thresholds\" or \"seek competition?\" Here the situation\nis trickier. The existence of a threshold doesn't guarantee the\ngame will be worth playing. If you play a round of Russian roulette,\nyou'll be in a situation with a threshold, certainly, but in the\nbest case you're no better off. \"Seek competition\" is similarly\nuseless; what if the prize isn't worth competing for? Sufficiently\nfast exponential growth guarantees both the shape and magnitude of\nthe return curve — because something that grows fast enough will\ngrow big even if it's trivially small at first — but thresholds\nonly guarantee the shape.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"#f4n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">4</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>A principle for taking advantage of thresholds has to include a\ntest to ensure the game is worth playing. Here's one that does: if\nyou come across something that's mediocre yet still popular, it\ncould be a good idea to replace it. For example, if a company makes\na product that people dislike yet still buy, then presumably they'd\nbuy a better alternative if you made one.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"#f5n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">5</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>It would be great if there were a way to find promising intellectual\nthresholds. Is there a way to tell which questions have whole new\nfields beyond them? I doubt we could ever predict this with certainty,\nbut the prize is so valuable that it would be useful to have\npredictors that were even a little better than random, and there's\nhope of finding those. We can to some degree predict when a research\nproblem <i>isn't</i> likely to lead to new discoveries: when it seems\nlegit but boring. Whereas the kind that do lead to new discoveries\ntend to seem very mystifying, but perhaps unimportant. (If they\nwere mystifying and obviously important, they'd be famous open\nquestions with lots of people already working on them.) So one\nheuristic here is to be driven by curiosity rather than careerism\n— to give free rein to your curiosity instead of working on what\nyou're supposed to.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\nThe prospect of superlinear returns for performance is an exciting\none for the ambitious. And there's good news in this department:\nthis territory is expanding in both directions. There are more types\nof work in which you can get superlinear returns, and the returns\nthemselves are growing.<br/><br/>There are two reasons for this, though they're so closely intertwined\nthat they're more like one and a half: progress in technology, and\nthe decreasing importance of organizations.<br/><br/>Fifty years ago it used to be much more necessary to be part of an\norganization to work on ambitious projects. It was the only way to\nget the resources you needed, the only way to have colleagues, and\nthe only way to get distribution. So in 1970 your prestige was in\nmost cases the prestige of the organization you belonged to. And\nprestige was an accurate predictor, because if you weren't part of\nan organization, you weren't likely to achieve much. There were a\nhandful of exceptions, most notably artists and writers, who worked\nalone using inexpensive tools and had their own brands. But even\nthey were at the mercy of organizations for reaching audiences.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"#f6n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">6</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>A world dominated by organizations damped variation in the returns\nfor performance. But this world has eroded significantly just in\nmy lifetime. Now a lot more people can have the freedom that artists\nand writers had in the 20th century. There are lots of ambitious\nprojects that don't require much initial funding, and lots of new\nways to learn, make money, find colleagues, and reach audiences.<br/><br/>There's still plenty of the old world left, but the rate of change\nhas been dramatic by historical standards. Especially considering\nwhat's at stake. It's hard to imagine a more fundamental change\nthan one in the returns for performance.<br/><br/>Without the damping effect of institutions, there will be more\nvariation in outcomes. Which doesn't imply everyone will be better\noff: people who do well will do even better, but those who do badly\nwill do worse. That's an important point to bear in mind. Exposing\noneself to superlinear returns is not for everyone. Most people\nwill be better off as part of the pool. So who should shoot for\nsuperlinear returns? Ambitious people of two types: those who know\nthey're so good that they'll be net ahead in a world with higher\nvariation, and those, particularly the young, who can afford to\nrisk trying it to find out.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"#f7n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">7</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The switch away from institutions won't simply be an exodus of their\ncurrent inhabitants. Many of the new winners will be people they'd\nnever have let in. So the resulting democratization of opportunity\nwill be both greater and more authentic than any tame intramural\nversion the institutions themselves might have cooked up.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\nNot everyone is happy about this great unlocking of ambition. It\nthreatens some vested interests and contradicts some ideologies. <font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"#f8n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">8</font></a>]</font>\nBut if you're an ambitious individual it's good news for you.\nHow should you take advantage of it?<br/><br/>The most obvious way to take advantage of superlinear returns for\nperformance is by doing exceptionally good work. At the far end of\nthe curve, incremental effort is a bargain. All the more so because\nthere's less competition at the far end — and not just for the\nobvious reason that it's hard to do something exceptionally well,\nbut also because people find the prospect so intimidating that few\neven try. Which means it's not just a bargain to do exceptional\nwork, but a bargain even to try to.<br/><br/>There are many variables that affect how good your work is, and if\nyou want to be an outlier you need to get nearly all of them right.\nFor example, to do something exceptionally well, you have to be\ninterested in it. Mere diligence is not enough. So in a world with\nsuperlinear returns, it's even more valuable to know what you're\ninterested in, and to find ways to work on it.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"#f9n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">9</font></a>]</font>\nIt will also be\nimportant to choose work that suits your circumstances. For example,\nif there's a kind of work that inherently requires a huge expenditure\nof time and energy, it will be increasingly valuable to do it when\nyou're young and don't yet have children.<br/><br/>There's a surprising amount of technique to doing great work.\nIt's not just a matter of trying hard. I'm going to take a shot\ngiving a recipe in one paragraph.<br/><br/>Choose work you have a natural aptitude for and a deep interest in.\nDevelop a habit of working on your own projects; it doesn't matter\nwhat they are so long as you find them excitingly ambitious. Work\nas hard as you can without burning out, and this will eventually\nbring you to one of the frontiers of knowledge. These look smooth\nfrom a distance, but up close they're full of gaps. Notice and\nexplore such gaps, and if you're lucky one will expand into a whole\nnew field. Take as much risk as you can afford; if you're not failing\noccasionally you're probably being too conservative. Seek out the\nbest colleagues. Develop good taste and learn from the best examples.\nBe honest, especially with yourself. Exercise and eat and sleep\nwell and avoid the more dangerous drugs. When in doubt, follow your\ncuriosity. It never lies, and it knows more than you do about what's\nworth paying attention to.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"#f10n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">10</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>And there is of course one other thing you need: to be lucky. Luck\nis always a factor, but it's even more of a factor when you're\nworking on your own rather than as part of an organization. And\nthough there are some valid aphorisms about luck being where\npreparedness meets opportunity and so on, there's also a component\nof true chance that you can't do anything about. The solution is\nto take multiple shots. Which is another reason to start taking\nrisks early.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\nThe best example of a field with superlinear returns is probably\nscience. It has exponential growth, in the form of learning, combined\nwith thresholds at the extreme edge of performance — literally at\nthe limits of knowledge.<br/><br/>The result has been a level of inequality in scientific discovery\nthat makes the wealth inequality of even the most stratified societies\nseem mild by comparison. Newton's discoveries were arguably greater\nthan all his contemporaries' combined.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"#f11n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">11</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>This point may seem obvious, but it might be just as well to spell\nit out. Superlinear returns imply inequality. The steeper the return\ncurve, the greater the variation in outcomes.<br/><br/>In fact, the correlation between superlinear returns and inequality\nis so strong that it yields another heuristic for finding work of\nthis type: look for fields where a few big winners outperform\neveryone else. A kind of work where everyone does about the same\nis unlikely to be one with superlinear returns.<br/><br/>What are fields where a few big winners outperform everyone else?\nHere are some obvious ones: sports, politics, art, music, acting,\ndirecting, writing, math, science, starting companies, and investing.\nIn sports the phenomenon is due to externally imposed thresholds;\nyou only need to be a few percent faster to win every race. In\npolitics, power grows much as it did in the days of emperors. And\nin some of the other fields (including politics) success is driven\nlargely by fame, which has its own source of superlinear growth.\nBut when we exclude sports and politics and the effects of fame, a\nremarkable pattern emerges: the remaining list is exactly the same\nas the list of fields where you have to be <a href=\"think.html\"><u>independent-minded</u></a> to\nsucceed — where your ideas have to be not just correct, but novel\nas well.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"#f12n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">12</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>This is obviously the case in science. You can't publish papers\nsaying things that other people have already said. But it's just\nas true in investing, for example. It's only useful to believe that\na company will do well if most other investors don't; if everyone\nelse thinks the company will do well, then its stock price will\nalready reflect that, and there's no room to make money.<br/><br/>What else can we learn from these fields? In all of them you have\nto put in the initial effort. Superlinear returns seem small at\nfirst. <i>At this rate,</i> you find yourself thinking, <i>I'll never get\nanywhere.</i> But because the reward curve rises so steeply at the far\nend, it's worth taking extraordinary measures to get there.<br/><br/>In the startup world, the name for this principle is \"do things\nthat don't scale.\" If you pay a ridiculous amount of attention to\nyour tiny initial set of customers, ideally you'll kick off exponential\ngrowth by word of mouth. But this same principle applies to anything\nthat grows exponentially. Learning, for example. When you first\nstart learning something, you feel lost. But it's worth making the\ninitial effort to get a toehold, because the more you learn, the\neasier it will get.<br/><br/>There's another more subtle lesson in the list of fields with\nsuperlinear returns: not to equate work with a job. For most of the\n20th century the two were identical for nearly everyone, and as a\nresult we've inherited a custom that equates productivity with\nhaving a job. Even now to most people the phrase \"your work\" means\ntheir job. But to a writer or artist or scientist it means whatever\nthey're currently studying or creating. For someone like that, their\nwork is something they carry with them from job to job, if they\nhave jobs at all. It may be done for an employer, but it's part of\ntheir portfolio.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\nIt's an intimidating prospect to enter a field where a few big\nwinners outperform everyone else. Some people do this deliberately,\nbut you don't need to. If you have sufficient natural ability and\nyou follow your curiosity sufficiently far, you'll end up in one.\nYour curiosity won't let you be interested in boring questions, and\ninteresting questions tend to create fields with superlinear returns\nif they're not already part of one.<br/><br/>The territory of superlinear returns is by no means static. Indeed,\nthe most extreme returns come from expanding it. So while both\nambition and curiosity can get you into this territory, curiosity\nmay be the more powerful of the two. Ambition tends to make you\nclimb existing peaks, but if you stick close enough to an interesting\nenough question, it may grow into a mountain beneath you.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>There's a limit to how sharply you can distinguish between effort,\nperformance, and return, because they're not sharply distinguished\nin fact. What counts as return to one person might be performance\nto another. But though the borders of these concepts are blurry,\nthey're not meaningless. I've tried to write about them as precisely\nas I could without crossing into error.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nEvolution itself is probably the most pervasive example of\nsuperlinear returns for performance. But this is hard for us to\nempathize with because we're not the recipients; we're the returns.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nKnowledge did of course have a practical effect before the\nIndustrial Revolution. The development of agriculture changed human\nlife completely. But this kind of change was the result of broad,\ngradual improvements in technique, not the discoveries of a few\nexceptionally learned people.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nIt's not mathematically correct to describe a step function as\nsuperlinear, but a step function starting from zero works like a\nsuperlinear function when it describes the reward curve for effort\nby a rational actor. If it starts at zero then the part before the\nstep is below any linearly increasing return, and the part after\nthe step must be above the necessary return at that point or no one\nwould bother.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f4n\"><font color=\"#000000\">4</font></a>]\nSeeking competition could be a good heuristic in the sense that\nsome people find it motivating. It's also somewhat of a guide to\npromising problems, because it's a sign that other people find them\npromising. But it's a very imperfect sign: often there's a clamoring\ncrowd chasing some problem, and they all end up being trumped by\nsomeone quietly working on another one.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f5n\"><font color=\"#000000\">5</font></a>]\nNot always, though. You have to be careful with this rule. When\nsomething is popular despite being mediocre, there's often a hidden\nreason why. Perhaps monopoly or regulation make it hard to compete.\nPerhaps customers have bad taste or have broken procedures for\ndeciding what to buy. There are huge swathes of mediocre things\nthat exist for such reasons.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f6n\"><font color=\"#000000\">6</font></a>]\nIn my twenties I wanted to be an <a href=\"worked.html\"><u>artist</u></a> \nand even went to art\nschool to study painting. Mostly because I liked art, but a nontrivial\npart of my motivation came from the fact that artists seemed least\nat the mercy of organizations.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f7n\"><font color=\"#000000\">7</font></a>]\nIn principle everyone is getting superlinear returns. Learning\ncompounds, and everyone learns in the course of their life. But in\npractice few push this kind of everyday learning to the point where\nthe return curve gets really steep.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f8n\"><font color=\"#000000\">8</font></a>]\nIt's unclear exactly what advocates of \"equity\" mean by it.\nThey seem to disagree among themselves. But whatever they mean is\nprobably at odds with a world in which institutions have less power\nto control outcomes, and a handful of outliers do much better than\neveryone else.<br/><br/>It may seem like bad luck for this concept that it arose at just\nthe moment when the world was shifting in the opposite direction,\nbut I don't think this was a coincidence. I think one reason it\narose now is because its adherents feel threatened by rapidly\nincreasing variation in performance.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f9n\"><font color=\"#000000\">9</font></a>]\nCorollary: Parents who pressure their kids to work on something\nprestigious, like medicine, even though they have no interest in\nit, will be hosing them even more than they have in the past.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f10n\"><font color=\"#000000\">10</font></a>]\nThe original version of this paragraph was the first draft of\n\"<a href=\"greatwork.html\"><u>How to Do Great Work</u></a>.\" \nAs soon as I wrote it I realized it was a more important topic than superlinear\nreturns, so I paused the present essay to expand this paragraph into its\nown. Practically nothing remains of the original version, because\nafter I finished \"How to Do Great Work\" I rewrote it based on that.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f11n\"><font color=\"#000000\">11</font></a>]\nBefore the Industrial Revolution, people who got rich usually\ndid it like emperors: capturing some resource made them more powerful\nand enabled them to capture more. Now it can be done like a scientist,\nby discovering or building something uniquely valuable. Most people\nwho get rich use a mix of the old and the new ways, but in the most\nadvanced economies the ratio has <a href=\"richnow.html\"><u>shifted dramatically</u></a> toward discovery\njust in the last half century.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f12n\"><font color=\"#000000\">12</font></a>]\nIt's not surprising that conventional-minded people would\ndislike inequality if independent-mindedness is one of the biggest\ndrivers of it. But it's not simply that they don't want anyone to\nhave what they can't. The conventional-minded literally can't imagine\nwhat it's like to have novel ideas. So the whole phenomenon of great\nvariation in performance seems unnatural to them, and when they\nencounter it they assume it must be due to cheating or to some\nmalign external influence.<br/><br/><br/><br/><font color=\"888888\"><b>Thanks</b> \nto Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison, Tyler Cowen,\nJessica Livingston, Harj Taggar, and Garry Tan for reading drafts\nof this.</font><br/><br/></font>","date":"2023-10-01T00:00:00Z"}
