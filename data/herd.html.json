Which is of course a recipe for\nexponential growth.  When one investor wants to invest in you, that\nmakes other investors want to, which makes others want to, and so\non.<br/><br/>Sometimes inexperienced founders mistakenly conclude that manipulating\nthese forces is the essence of fundraising.  They hear stories about\nstampedes to invest in successful startups, and think it's therefore\nthe mark of a successful startup to have this happen.  But actually\nthe two are not that highly correlated.  Lots of startups that cause\nstampedes end up flaming out (in extreme cases, partly as a result\nof the stampede), and lots of very successful startups were only\nmoderately popular with investors the first time they raised money.<br/><br/>So the point of this essay is not to explain how to create a stampede,\nbut merely to explain the forces that generate them.  These forces\nare always at work to some degree in fundraising, and they can cause\nsurprising situations.  If you understand them, you can at least\navoid being surprised.<br/><br/>One reason investors like you more when other investors like you\nis that you actually become a better investment.  Raising money\ndecreases the risk of failure.  Indeed, although investors hate it,\nyou are for this reason justified in raising your valuation for\nlater investors.  The investors who invested when you had no money\nwere taking more risk, and are entitled to higher returns.  Plus a\ncompany that has raised money is literally more valuable.  After\nyou raise the first million dollars, the company is at least a\nmillion dollars more valuable, because it's the same company as\nbefore, plus it has a million dollars in the bank.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f1n\"><font color=\"#999999\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Beware, though, because later investors so hate to have the price\nraised on them that they resist even this self-evident reasoning.\nOnly raise the price on an investor you're comfortable with losing,\nbecause some will angrily refuse.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f2n\"><font color=\"#999999\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The second reason investors like you more when you've had some\nsuccess at fundraising is that it makes you more confident, and an\ninvestors' opinion of <a href=\"convince.html\">you</a> is the foundation\nof their opinion of your company.  Founders are often surprised how\nquickly investors seem to know when they start to succeed at raising\nmoney.  And while there are in fact lots of ways for such information\nto spread among investors, the main vector is probably the founders\nthemselves.  Though they're often clueless about technology, most\ninvestors are pretty good at reading people.  When fundraising is\ngoing well, investors are quick to sense it in your increased\nconfidence.  (This is one case where the average founder's inability\nto remain poker-faced works to your advantage.)<br/><br/>But frankly the most important reason investors like you more when\nyou've started to raise money is that they're bad at judging startups.\nJudging startups is hard even for the best investors.  The mediocre\nones might as well be flipping coins.  So when mediocre investors\nsee that lots of other people want to invest in you, they assume\nthere must be a reason.  This leads to the phenomenon known in the\nValley as the \"hot deal,\" where you have more interest from investors\nthan you can handle.<br/><br/>The best investors aren't influenced much by the opinion of other\ninvestors.  It would only dilute their own judgment to average it\ntogether with other people's.  But they are indirectly influenced\nin the practical sense that interest from other investors imposes\na deadline.  This is the fourth way in which offers beget offers.\nIf you start to get far along the track toward an offer with one\nfirm, it will sometimes provoke other firms, even good ones, to\nmake up their minds, lest they lose the deal.<br/><br/>Unless you're a wizard at negotiation (and if you're not sure,\nyou're not) be very careful about exaggerating this to push a good\ninvestor to decide.  Founders try this sort of thing all the time,\nand investors are very sensitive to it.  If anything oversensitive.\nBut you're safe so long as you're telling the truth.  If you're\ngetting far along with investor B, but you'd rather raise money\nfrom investor A, you can tell investor A that this is happening.\nThere's no manipulation in that.  You're genuinely in a bind, because\nyou really would rather raise money from A, but you can't safely\nreject an offer from B when it's still uncertain what A will decide.<br/><br/>Do not, however, tell A who B is.  VCs will sometimes ask which\nother VCs you're talking to, but you should never tell them.  Angels\nyou can sometimes tell about other angels, because angels cooperate\nmore with one another. But if VCs ask, just point out that they\nwouldn't want you telling other firms about your conversations, and\nyou feel obliged to do the same for any firm you talk to.  If they\npush you, point out that you're inexperienced at fundraising — which\nis always a safe card to play — and you feel you have to be\nextra cautious. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f3n\"><font color=\"#999999\">3</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>While few startups will experience a stampede of interest, almost\nall will at least initially experience the other side of this\nphenomenon, where the herd remains clumped together at a distance.\nThe fact that investors are so much influenced by other investors'\nopinions means you always start out in something of a hole.  So\ndon't be demoralized by how hard it is to get the first commitment,\nbecause much of the difficulty comes from this external force.  The\nsecond will be easier.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nAn accountant might say that a company that has raised a million\ndollars is no richer if it's convertible debt, but in practice money\nraised as convertible debt is little different from money raised\nin an equity round.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nFounders are often surprised by this, but investors can get\nvery emotional.  Or rather indignant; that's the main emotion I've\nobserved; but it is very common, to the point where it sometimes\ncauses investors to act against their own interests.  I know of one\ninvestor who invested in a startup at a $15 million valuation cap.\nEarlier he'd had an opportunity to invest at a $5 million cap, but\nhe refused because a friend who invested earlier had been able to\ninvest at a $3 million cap.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nIf an investor pushes you hard to tell them about your conversations\nwith other investors, is this someone you want as an investor?<br/><br/>\n<b>Thanks</b> to Paul Buchheit, Jessica Livingston, Geoff Ralston, and Garry Tan\nfor reading drafts of this.<br/><br/></br></p></font>","date":"2013-08-01T00:00:00Z"}
