{"href":"america.html","title":"Why Startups Condense in America","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">May 2006<br/><br/><i>(This essay is derived from a keynote at Xtech.)</i><br/><br/>Startups happen in clusters.  There are a lot of them in Silicon\nValley and Boston, and few in Chicago or Miami.  A country that\nwants startups will probably also have to reproduce whatever makes\nthese clusters form.<br/><br/>I've claimed that the <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/siliconvalley.html\">recipe</a> is a\ngreat university near a town smart\npeople like.  If you set up those conditions within the US, startups\nwill form as inevitably as water droplets condense on a cold piece\nof metal.  But when I consider what it would take to reproduce\nSilicon Valley in another country, it's clear the US is a particularly\nhumid environment.  Startups condense more easily here.<br/><br/>It is by no means a lost cause to try to create a silicon valley\nin another country.  There's room not merely to equal Silicon Valley,\nbut to surpass it.  But if you want to do that, you have to\nunderstand the advantages startups get from being in America.<br/><br/><b>1. The US Allows Immigration.</b><br/><br/>For example, I doubt it would be possible to reproduce Silicon\nValley in Japan, because one of Silicon Valley's most distinctive\nfeatures is immigration.  Half the people there speak with accents.\nAnd the Japanese don't like immigration.  When they think about how\nto make a Japanese silicon valley, I suspect they unconsciously\nframe it as how to make one consisting only of Japanese people.\nThis way of framing the question probably guarantees failure.<br/><br/>A silicon valley has to be a mecca for the smart and the ambitious,\nand you can't have a mecca if you don't let people into it.<br/><br/>Of course, it's not saying much that America is more open to\nimmigration than Japan.  Immigration policy is one area where a\ncompetitor could do better.<br/><br/><b>2. The US Is a Rich Country.</b><br/><br/>I could see India one day producing a rival to Silicon Valley.\nObviously they have the right people: you can tell that by the\nnumber of Indians in the current Silicon Valley.  The problem with\nIndia itself is that it's still so poor.<br/><br/>In poor countries, things we take for granted are missing.  A friend\nof mine visiting India sprained her ankle falling down the steps\nin a railway station.  When she turned to see what had happened,\nshe found the steps were all different heights.  In industrialized\ncountries we walk down steps our whole lives and never think about\nthis, because there's an infrastructure that prevents such a staircase\nfrom being built.<br/><br/>The US has never been so poor as some countries are now.  There\nhave never been swarms of beggars in the streets of American cities.\nSo we have no data about what it takes to get from the swarms-of-beggars\nstage to the silicon-valley stage.  Could you have both at once,\nor does there have to be some baseline prosperity before you get a\nsilicon valley?<br/><br/>I suspect there is some speed limit to the evolution\nof an economy.  Economies are made out of people, and attitudes can\nonly change a certain amount per generation.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/america.html#f1n\"><font color=\"#777777\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/><b>3. The US Is Not (Yet) a Police State.</b><br/><br/>Another country I could see wanting to have a silicon valley is\nChina.  But I doubt they could do it yet either.  China still seems\nto be a police state, and although present rulers seem enlightened\ncompared to the last, even enlightened despotism can probably only\nget you part way toward being a great economic power.<br/><br/>It can get you factories for building things designed elsewhere.\nCan it get you the designers, though?  Can imagination flourish\nwhere people can't criticize the government?  Imagination means\nhaving odd ideas, and it's hard to have odd ideas about technology\nwithout also having odd ideas about politics.  And in any case,\nmany technical ideas do have political implications.  So if you\nsquash dissent, the back pressure will propagate into technical\nfields. \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/america.html#f2n\"><font color=\"#777777\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Singapore would face a similar problem.  Singapore seems very aware\nof the importance of encouraging startups.  But while energetic\ngovernment intervention may be able to make a port run efficiently,\nit can't coax startups into existence.  A state that bans chewing\ngum has a long way to go before it could create a San Francisco.<br/><br/>Do you need a San Francisco?  Might there not be an alternate route\nto innovation that goes through obedience and cooperation instead\nof individualism?  Possibly, but I'd bet not.  Most imaginative\npeople seem to share a certain prickly <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/gba.html\">independence</a>,\nwhenever and wherever they lived.  You see it in Diogenes telling\nAlexander to get out of his light and two thousand years later in\nFeynman breaking into safes at Los Alamos.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/america.html#f3n\"><font color=\"#777777\">3</font></a>]</font>\nImaginative people\ndon't want to follow or lead.  They're most productive when everyone\ngets to do what they want.<br/><br/>Ironically, of all rich countries the US has lost the most civil\nliberties recently.  But I'm not too worried yet.  I'm hoping once\nthe present administration is out, the natural openness of American\nculture will reassert itself.<br/><br/><b>4. American Universities Are Better.</b><br/><br/>You need a great university to seed a silicon valley, and so far\nthere are few outside the US.  I asked a handful of American computer\nscience professors which universities in Europe were most admired,\nand they all basically said \"Cambridge\" followed by a long pause\nwhile they tried to think of others.  There don't seem to be many\nuniversities elsewhere that compare with the best in America, at\nleast in technology.<br/><br/>In some countries this is the result of a deliberate policy.  The\nGerman and Dutch governments, perhaps from fear of elitism, try to\nensure that all universities are roughly equal in quality.  The\ndownside is that none are especially good.   The best professors\nare spread out, instead of being concentrated as they are in the\nUS.  This probably makes them less productive, because they don't\nhave good colleagues to inspire them.  It also means no one university\nwill be good enough to act as a mecca, attracting talent from abroad\nand causing startups to form around it.<br/><br/>The case of Germany is a strange one.  The Germans invented the\nmodern university, and up till the 1930s theirs were the best in\nthe world.  Now they have none that stand out.  As I was mulling\nthis over, I found myself thinking: \"I can understand why German\nuniversities declined in the 1930s, after they excluded Jews.  But\nsurely they should have bounced back by now.\"  Then I realized:\nmaybe not.  There are few Jews left in Germany and most Jews I know\nwould not want to move there.  And if you took any great American\nuniversity and removed the Jews, you'd have some pretty big gaps.\nSo maybe it would be a lost cause trying to create a silicon valley\nin Germany, because you couldn't establish the level of university\nyou'd need as a seed.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/america.html#f4n\"><font color=\"#777777\">4</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>It's natural for US universities to compete with one another because\nso many are private.  To reproduce the quality of American universities\nyou probably also have to reproduce this.  If universities are\ncontrolled by the central government, log-rolling will pull them\nall toward the mean: the new Institute of X will end up at the\nuniversity in the district of a powerful politician, instead of\nwhere it should be.<br/><br/><b>5. You Can Fire People in America.</b><br/><br/>I think one of the biggest obstacles to creating startups in Europe\nis the attitude toward employment.  The famously rigid labor laws\nhurt every company, but startups especially, because startups have\nthe least time to spare for bureaucratic hassles.<br/><br/>The difficulty of firing people is a particular problem for startups\nbecause they have no redundancy.  Every person has to do their\njob well.<br/><br/>But the problem is more than just that some startup might have a\nproblem firing someone they needed to.  Across industries and\ncountries, there's a strong inverse correlation between performance\nand job security.  Actors and directors are fired at the end of\neach film, so they have to deliver every time.  Junior professors\nare fired by default after a few years unless the university chooses\nto grant them tenure.  Professional athletes know they'll be pulled\nif they play badly for just a couple games.  At the other end of\nthe scale (at least in the US) are auto workers, New York City\nschoolteachers, and civil servants, who are all nearly impossible\nto fire.  The trend is so clear that you'd have to be willfully\nblind not to see it.<br/><br/>Performance isn't everything, you say?  Well, are auto workers,\nschoolteachers, and civil servants <i>happier</i> than actors,\nprofessors, and professional athletes?<br/><br/>European public opinion will apparently tolerate people being fired\nin industries where they really care about performance.  Unfortunately\nthe only industry they care enough about so far is soccer.  But\nthat is at least a precedent.<br/><br/><b>6. In America Work Is Less Identified with Employment.</b><br/><br/>The problem in more traditional places like Europe and Japan goes\ndeeper than the employment laws.  More dangerous is the attitude\nthey reflect: that an employee is a kind of servant, whom the\nemployer has a duty to protect.  It used to be that way in America\ntoo.  In 1970 you were still supposed to get a job with a big\ncompany, for whom ideally you'd work your whole career.  In return\nthe company would take care of you: they'd try not to fire you,\ncover your medical expenses, and support you in old age.<br/><br/>Gradually employment has been shedding such paternalistic overtones\nand becoming simply an economic exchange.  But the importance of\nthe new model is not just that it makes it easier for startups to\ngrow.  More important, I think, is that it it makes it easier for\npeople to <i>start</i> startups.<br/><br/>Even in the US most kids graduating from college still think they're\nsupposed to get jobs, as if you couldn't be productive without being\nsomeone's employee.  But the less you identify work with employment,\nthe easier it becomes to start a startup.  When you see your career\nas a series of different types of work, instead of a lifetime's\nservice to a single employer, there's less risk in starting your\nown company, because you're only replacing one segment instead of\ndiscarding the whole thing.<br/><br/>The old ideas are so powerful that even the most successful startup\nfounders have had to struggle against them.  A year after the\nfounding of Apple, Steve Wozniak still hadn't quit HP.  He still\nplanned to work there for life.  And when Jobs found someone to\ngive Apple serious venture funding, on the condition that Woz quit,\nhe initially refused, arguing that he'd designed both the Apple I\nand the Apple II while working at HP, and there was no reason he\ncouldn't continue.<br/><br/><b>7.  America Is Not Too Fussy.</b><br/><br/>If there are any laws regulating businesses, you can assume larval\nstartups will break most of them, because they don't know what the\nlaws are and don't have time to find out.<br/><br/>For example, many startups in America begin in places where it's\nnot really legal to run a business.  Hewlett-Packard, Apple, and\nGoogle were all run out of garages.  Many more startups, including\nours, were initially run out of apartments.  If the laws against\nsuch things were actually enforced, most startups wouldn't happen.<br/><br/>That could be a problem in fussier countries.  If Hewlett and Packard\ntried running an electronics company out of their garage in\nSwitzerland, the old lady next door would report them to the municipal\nauthorities.<br/><br/>But the worst problem in other countries is probably the effort\nrequired just to start a company.  A friend of mine started a company\nin Germany in the early 90s, and was shocked to discover, among\nmany other regulations, that you needed $20,000 in capital to\nincorporate.  That's one reason I'm not typing this on an Apfel\nlaptop.  Jobs and Wozniak couldn't have come up with that kind of\nmoney in a company financed by selling a VW bus and an HP calculator.\nWe couldn't have started Viaweb either.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/america.html#f5n\"><font color=\"#777777\">5</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Here's a tip for governments that want to encourage startups: read\nthe stories of existing startups, and then try to simulate what\nwould have happened in your country.  When you hit something that\nwould have killed Apple, prune it off.<br/><br/><i>Startups are <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/marginal.html\">marginal</a>.</i>  \nThey're started by the poor and the\ntimid; they begin in marginal space and spare time; they're started\nby people who are supposed to be doing something else; and though\nbusinesses, their founders often know nothing about business.  Young\nstartups are fragile.  A society that trims its margins sharply\nwill kill them all.<br/><br/><b>8. America Has a Large Domestic Market.</b><br/><br/>What sustains a startup in the beginning is the prospect of getting\ntheir initial product out.  The successful ones therefore make the\nfirst version as simple as possible.  In the US they usually begin\nby making something just for the local market.<br/><br/>This works in America, because the local market is 300 million\npeople.  It wouldn't work so well in Sweden.  In a small country,\na startup has a harder task: they have to sell internationally from\nthe start.<br/><br/>The EU was designed partly to simulate a single, large domestic\nmarket.  The problem is that the inhabitants still speak many\ndifferent languages.  So a software startup in Sweden is still at\na disadvantage relative to one in the US, because they have to deal\nwith internationalization from the beginning.  It's significant\nthat the most famous recent startup in Europe, Skype, worked on a\nproblem that was intrinsically international.<br/><br/>However, for better or worse it looks as if Europe will in a few\ndecades speak a single language.  When I was a student in Italy in\n1990, few Italians spoke English.  Now all educated people seem to\nbe expected to-- and Europeans do not like to seem uneducated.  This\nis presumably a taboo subject, but if present trends continue,\nFrench and German will eventually go the way of Irish and Luxembourgish:\nthey'll be spoken in homes and by eccentric nationalists.<br/><br/><b>9. America Has Venture Funding.</b><br/><br/>Startups are easier to start in America because funding is easier\nto get.  There are now a few VC firms outside the US, but startup\nfunding doesn't only come from VC firms.  A more important source,\nbecause it's more personal and comes earlier in the process, is\nmoney from individual angel investors.  Google might never have got\nto the point where they could raise millions from VC funds if they\nhadn't first raised a hundred thousand from Andy Bechtolsheim.  And\nhe could help them because he was one of the founders of Sun.  This\npattern is repeated constantly in startup hubs.  It's this pattern\nthat <i>makes</i> them startup hubs.<br/><br/>The good news is, all you have to do to get the process rolling is\nget those first few startups successfully launched.  If they stick\naround after they get rich, startup founders will almost automatically\nfund and encourage new startups.<br/><br/>The bad news is that the cycle is slow.  It probably takes five\nyears, on average, before a startup founder can make angel investments.\nAnd while governments <i>might</i> be able to set up local VC funds\nby supplying the money themselves and recruiting people from existing\nfirms to run them, only organic growth can produce angel investors.<br/><br/>Incidentally, America's private universities are one reason there's\nso much venture capital.  A lot of the money in VC funds comes from\ntheir endowments.  So another advantage of private universities is\nthat a good chunk of the country's wealth is managed by enlightened\ninvestors.<br/><br/><b>10. America Has Dynamic Typing for Careers.</b><br/><br/>Compared to other industrialized countries the US is disorganized\nabout routing people into careers.  For example, in America people\noften don't decide to go to medical school till they've finished\ncollege.  In Europe they generally decide in high school.<br/><br/>The European approach reflects the old idea that each person has a\nsingle, definite occupation-- which is not far from the idea that\neach person has a natural \"station\" in life.  If this were true,\nthe most efficient plan would be to discover each person's station\nas early as possible, so they could receive the training appropriate\nto it.<br/><br/>In the US things are more haphazard.  But that turns out to be an\nadvantage as an economy gets more liquid, just as dynamic typing\nturns out to work better than static for ill-defined problems.  This\nis particularly true with startups.  \"Startup founder\" is not the\nsort of career a high school student would choose.  If you ask at\nthat age, people will choose conservatively.  They'll choose\nwell-understood occupations like engineer, or doctor, or lawyer.<br/><br/>Startups are the kind of thing people don't plan, so you're more\nlikely to get them in a society where it's ok to make career decisions\non the fly.<br/><br/>For example, in theory the purpose of a PhD program is to train you\nto do research.  But fortunately in the US this is another rule\nthat isn't very strictly enforced.  In the US most people in CS PhD\nprograms are there simply because they wanted to learn more.  They\nhaven't decided what they'll do afterward.  So American grad schools\nspawn a lot of startups, because students don't feel they're failing\nif they don't go into research.<br/><br/>Those worried about America's \"competitiveness\" often suggest\nspending more on public schools.  But perhaps America's lousy public\nschools have a hidden advantage.  Because they're so bad, the kids\nadopt an attitude of waiting for college.  I did; I knew I was\nlearning so little that I wasn't even learning what the choices\nwere, let alone which to choose.  This is demoralizing, but it does\nat least make you keep an open mind.<br/><br/>Certainly if I had to choose between bad high schools and good\nuniversities, like the US, and good high schools and bad universities,\nlike most other industrialized countries, I'd take the US system.\nBetter to make everyone feel like a late bloomer than a failed child\nprodigy.<br/><br/><b>Attitudes</b><br/><br/>There's one item conspicuously missing from this list: American\nattitudes.  Americans are said to be more entrepreneurial, and less\nafraid of risk.  But America has no monopoly on this.  Indians and\nChinese seem plenty entrepreneurial, perhaps more than Americans.<br/><br/>Some say Europeans are less energetic, but I don't believe it.  I\nthink the problem with Europe is not that they lack balls, but that\nthey lack examples.<br/><br/>Even in the US, the most successful startup founders are often\ntechnical people who are quite timid, initially, about the idea of\nstarting their own company. Few are the sort of backslapping\nextroverts one thinks of as typically American.  They can usually\nonly summon up the activation energy to start a startup when they\nmeet people who've done it and realize they could too.<br/><br/>I think what holds back European hackers is simply that they don't\nmeet so many people who've done it. You see that variation even\nwithin the US.  Stanford students are more entrepreneurial than\nYale students, but not because of some difference in their characters;\nthe Yale students just have fewer examples.<br/><br/>I admit there seem to be different attitudes toward ambition in\nEurope and the US.  In the US it's ok to be overtly ambitious, and\nin most of Europe it's not.  But this can't be an intrinsically\nEuropean quality; previous generations of Europeans were as ambitious\nas Americans.  What happened?  My hypothesis is that ambition was\ndiscredited by the terrible things ambitious people did in the first\nhalf of the twentieth century.  Now swagger is out. (Even now the\nimage of a very ambitious German presses a button or two, doesn't\nit?)<br/><br/>It would be surprising if European attitudes weren't affected by\nthe disasters of the twentieth century.  It takes a while to be\noptimistic after events like that.  But ambition is human nature.\nGradually it will re-emerge.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/america.html#f6n\"><font color=\"#777777\">6</font></a>]</font><br/><br/><b>How To Do Better</b><br/><br/>I don't mean to suggest by this list that America is the perfect\nplace for startups.  It's the best place so far, but the sample\nsize is small, and \"so far\" is not very long.   On historical time \nscales, what we have now is just a\nprototype.<br/><br/>So let's look at Silicon Valley the way you'd look at a product\nmade by a competitor.  What weaknesses could you exploit?  How could\nyou make something users would like better?  The users in this case\nare those critical few thousand people you'd like to move to your\nsilicon valley.<br/><br/>To start with, Silicon Valley is too far from San Francisco.  Palo\nAlto, the original ground zero, is about thirty miles away, and the\npresent center more like forty.  So people who come to work in\nSilicon Valley face an unpleasant choice: either live in the boring\nsprawl of the valley proper, or live in San Francisco and endure\nan hour commute each way.<br/><br/>The best thing would be if the silicon valley were not merely closer\nto the interesting city, but interesting itself.  And there is a\nlot of room for improvement here.  Palo Alto is not so bad, but\neverything built since is the worst sort of strip development.  You\ncan measure how demoralizing it is by the number of people who will\nsacrifice two hours a day commuting rather than live there.<br/><br/>Another area in which you could easily surpass Silicon Valley is\npublic transportation.  There is a train running the length of it,\nand by American standards it's not bad.  Which is to say that to\nJapanese or Europeans it would seem like something out of the third\nworld.<br/><br/>The kind of people you want to attract to your silicon valley like\nto get around by train, bicycle, and on foot.  So if you want to\nbeat America, design a town that puts cars last.  It will be a while\nbefore any American city can bring itself to do that.<br/><br/><b>Capital Gains</b><br/><br/>There are also a couple things you could do to beat America at the\nnational level.  One would be to have lower capital gains taxes.\nIt doesn't seem critical to have the lowest <i>income</i> taxes,\nbecause to take advantage of those, people have to move.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/america.html#f7n\"><font color=\"#777777\">7</font></a>]</font>\nBut\nif capital gains rates vary, you move assets, not yourself, so\nchanges are reflected at market speeds.  The lower the rate, the\ncheaper it is to buy stock in growing companies as opposed to real\nestate, or bonds, or stocks bought for the dividends they pay.<br/><br/>So if you want to encourage startups you should have a low rate on\ncapital gains.  Politicians are caught between a rock and a hard\nplace here, however: make the capital gains rate low and be accused\nof creating \"tax breaks for the rich,\" or make it high and starve\ngrowing companies of investment capital.   As Galbraith said,\npolitics is a matter of choosing between the unpalatable and the\ndisastrous.  A lot of governments experimented with the disastrous\nin the twentieth century; now the trend seems to be toward the\nmerely unpalatable.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, the leaders now are European countries like Belgium,\nwhich has a capital gains tax rate of zero.<br/><br/><b>Immigration</b><br/><br/>The other place you could beat the US would be with smarter immigration\npolicy.  There are huge gains to be made here.  Silicon valleys are\nmade of people, remember.<br/><br/>Like a company whose software runs on Windows, those in the current\nSilicon Valley are all too aware of the shortcomings of the INS,\nbut there's little they can do about it.  They're hostages of the\nplatform.<br/><br/>America's immigration system has never been well run, and since\n2001 there has been an additional admixture of paranoia.  What\nfraction of the smart people who want to come to America can even\nget in?  I doubt even half.  Which means if you made a competing\ntechnology hub that let in all smart people, you'd immediately get\nmore than half the world's top talent, for free.<br/><br/>US immigration policy is particularly ill-suited to startups, because\nit reflects a model of work from the 1970s.  It assumes good technical\npeople have college degrees, and that work means working for a big\ncompany.<br/><br/>If you don't have a college degree you can't get an H1B visa, the\ntype usually issued to programmers.  But a test that excludes Steve\nJobs, Bill Gates, and Michael Dell can't be a good one.  Plus you\ncan't get a visa for working on your own company, only for working\nas an employee of someone else's.  And if you want to apply for\ncitizenship you daren't work for a startup at all, because if your\nsponsor goes out of business, you have to start over.<br/><br/>American immigration policy keeps out most smart people, and channels\nthe rest into unproductive jobs.  It would be easy to do better.\nImagine if, instead, you treated immigration like recruiting-- if\nyou made a conscious effort to seek out the smartest people and get\nthem to come to your country.<br/><br/>A country that got immigration right would have a huge advantage.\nAt this point you could become a mecca for smart people simply by\nhaving an immigration system that let them in.<br/><br/><b>A Good Vector</b><br/><br/>If you look at the kinds of things you have to do to create an\nenvironment where startups condense, none are great sacrifices.\nGreat universities?  Livable towns?  Civil liberties?  Flexible\nemployment laws?  Immigration policies that let in smart people?\nTax laws that encourage growth?  It's not as if you have to risk\ndestroying your country to get a silicon valley; these are all good\nthings in their own right.<br/><br/>And then of course there's the question, can you afford not to?  I\ncan imagine a future in which the default choice of ambitious young\npeople is to start their <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/hiring.html\">own</a> company\nrather than work for someone else's.  I'm not sure that will happen,\nbut it's where the trend points now.  And if that is the future,\nplaces that don't have startups will be a whole step behind,\nlike those that missed the Industrial Revolution.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nOn the verge of the Industrial Revolution, England was already\nthe richest country in the world.  As far as such things can be\ncompared, per capita income in England in 1750 was higher than\nIndia's in 1960.<br/><br/>Deane, Phyllis, <i>The First Industrial Revolution</i>, Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 1965.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\n This has already happened once in China, during the Ming\nDynasty, when the country turned its back on industrialization at\nthe command of the court.

Instead of no Jews moving there, only\nJews would move there, and I don't think you could build a silicon\nvalley out of just Jews any more than you could out of just Japanese.<br/><br/>(This is not a remark about the qualities of these groups, just their\nsizes.  Japanese are only about 2% of the world population, and\nJews about .2%.)<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f5n\"><font color=\"#000000\">5</font></a>]\nAccording to the World Bank, the initial capital requirement\nfor German companies is 47.6% of the per capita income.

It\nseems more accurate (or at least, as accurate) to call the years\nafter 1914 a nightmare than to call those before a dream.

Above that people get serious about tax avoidance.  The reason\nis that the payoff for avoiding tax grows hyperexponentially (x/1-x\nfor 0 &lt; x &lt; 1).  If your income tax rate is 10%, moving to Monaco\nwould only give you 11% more income, which wouldn't even cover the\nextra cost.  If it's 90%, you'd get ten times as much income.  And\nat 98%, as it was briefly in Britain in the 70s, moving to Monaco\nwould give you fifty times as much income.  It seems quite likely\nthat European governments of the 70s never drew this curve.<br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Matthias Felleisen, Jessica\nLivingston, Robert Morris, Neil Rimer, Hugues Steinier, Brad \nTempleton, Fred Wilson, and Stephen Wolfram for reading\ndrafts of this, and to Ed Dumbill for inviting me to speak.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2006-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
