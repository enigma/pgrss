{"href":"lies.html","title":"Lies We Tell Kids","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">May 2008<br/><br/>Adults lie constantly to kids.  I'm not saying we should stop, but\nI think we should at least examine which lies we tell and why.<br/><br/>There may also be a benefit to us.  We were all lied to as kids,\nand some of the lies we were told still affect us.  So by studying\nthe ways adults lie to kids, we may be able to clear our heads of\nlies we were told.<br/><br/>I'm using the word \"lie\" in a very general sense: not just overt\nfalsehoods, but also all the more subtle ways we mislead kids.\nThough \"lie\" has negative connotations, I don't mean to suggest we\nshould never do this—just that we should pay attention when\nwe do.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f1n\"><font color=\"#999999\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>One of the most remarkable things about the way we lie to kids is\nhow broad the conspiracy is.  All adults know what their culture \nlies to kids about: they're the questions you answer \"Ask\nyour parents.\"  If a kid asked who won the World Series in 1982\nor what the atomic weight of carbon was, you could just tell him.\nBut if a kid asks you \"Is there a God?\" or \"What's a prostitute?\"\nyou'll probably say \"Ask your parents.\"<br/><br/>Since we all agree, kids see few cracks in the view of the world\npresented to them.  The biggest disagreements are between parents\nand schools, but even those are small. Schools are careful what\nthey say about controversial topics, and if they do contradict what\nparents want their kids to believe, parents either pressure the\nschool into keeping \n<a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=parents+complain+inappropriate+book\">quiet</a> or move their kids to a new school.<br/><br/>The conspiracy is so thorough that most kids who discover it do so\nonly by discovering internal contradictions in what they're told.\nIt can be traumatic for the ones who wake up during the operation.\nHere's what happened to Einstein:\n<blockquote>\n  Through the reading of popular scientific books I soon reached\n  the conviction that much in the stories of the Bible could not\n  be true.  The consequence was a positively fanatic freethinking\n  coupled with the impression that youth is intentionally being\n  deceived by the state through lies: it was a crushing impression.\n  <font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f2n\"><font color=\"#999999\">2</font></a>]</font>\n</blockquote>\nI remember that feeling.  By 15 I was convinced the world was corrupt\nfrom end to end.  That's why movies like <i>The Matrix</i> have such\nresonance.  Every kid grows up in a fake world.  In a way it would\nbe easier if the forces behind it were as clearly differentiated\nas a bunch of evil machines, and one could make a clean break just by\ntaking a pill.<br/><br/>\n<b>Protection</b><br/><br/>If you ask adults why they lie to kids, the most common reason they\ngive is to protect them.  And kids do need protecting.  The environment\nyou want to create for a newborn child will be quite unlike the\nstreets of a big city.<br/><br/>That seems so obvious it seems wrong to call it a lie.  It's certainly\nnot a bad lie to tell, to give a baby the impression the world is\nquiet and warm and safe.  But this harmless type of lie can turn\nsour if left unexamined.<br/><br/>Imagine if you tried to keep someone in as protected an environment\nas a newborn till age 18.  To mislead someone so grossly about the\nworld would seem not protection but abuse.  That's an extreme\nexample, of course; when parents do that sort of thing it becomes\nnational news.  But you see the same problem on a smaller scale in\nthe malaise teenagers feel in suburbia.<br/><br/>The main purpose of suburbia is to provide a protected environment\nfor children to grow up in.  And it seems great for 10 year olds.\nI liked living in suburbia when I was 10.  I didn't notice how\nsterile it was.  My whole world was no bigger than a few friends'\nhouses I bicycled to and some woods I ran around in.  On a log scale\nI was midway between crib and globe.  A suburban street was just\nthe right size.  But as I grew older, suburbia started to feel\nsuffocatingly fake.<br/><br/>Life can be pretty good at 10 or 20, but it's often frustrating at\n15.  This is too big a problem to solve here, but certainly one\nreason life sucks at 15 is that kids are trapped in a world designed\nfor 10 year olds.<br/><br/>What do parents hope to protect their children from by raising them\nin suburbia?  A friend who moved out of Manhattan said merely that\nher 3 year old daughter \"saw too much.\"  Off the top of my head,\nthat might include: people who are high or drunk, poverty, madness,\ngruesome medical conditions, sexual behavior of various degrees of\noddness, and violent anger.<br/><br/>I think it's the anger that would worry me most if I had a 3 year\nold.  I was 29 when I moved to New York and I was surprised even\nthen.  I wouldn't want a 3 year old to see some of the disputes I\nsaw.  It would be too frightening.  A lot of the things adults\nconceal from smaller children, they conceal because they'd be\nfrightening, not because they want to conceal the existence of such\nthings.  Misleading the child is just a byproduct.<br/><br/>This seems one of the most justifiable types of lying adults do to\nkids.  But because the lies are indirect we don't keep a very strict\naccounting of them.  Parents know they've concealed the facts about\nsex, and many at some point sit their kids down and explain more.\nBut few tell their kids about the differences between the real world\nand the cocoon they grew up in.  Combine this with the confidence\nparents try to instill in their kids, and every year you get a new\ncrop of 18 year olds who think they know how to run the world.<br/><br/>Don't all 18 year olds think they know how to run the world?  Actually\nthis seems to be a recent innovation, no more than about 100 years old.\nIn preindustrial times teenage kids were junior members of the adult\nworld and comparatively well aware of their shortcomings.  They\ncould see they weren't as strong or skillful as the village smith.\nIn past times people lied to kids about some things more than we\ndo now, but the lies implicit in an artificial, protected environment\nare a recent invention.  Like a lot of new inventions, the rich got\nthis first.  Children of kings and great magnates were the first\nto grow up out of touch with the world.  Suburbia means half the\npopulation can live like kings in that respect.<br/><br/>\n<b>Sex (and Drugs)</b><br/><br/>I'd have different worries about raising teenage kids in New York.\nI'd worry less about what they'd see, and more about what they'd\ndo.  I went to college with a lot of kids who grew up in Manhattan,\nand as a rule they seemed pretty jaded.  They seemed to have lost\ntheir virginity at an average of about 14 and by college had tried\nmore drugs than I'd even heard of.<br/><br/>The reasons parents don't want their teenage kids having sex are\ncomplex.  There are some obvious dangers: pregnancy and sexually\ntransmitted diseases.  But those aren't the only reasons parents\ndon't want their kids having sex.  The average parents of a 14 year\nold girl would hate the idea of her having sex even if there were\nzero risk of pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases.<br/><br/>Kids can probably sense they aren't being told the whole story.\nAfter all, pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases are just as\nmuch a problem for adults, and they have sex.<br/><br/>What really bothers parents about their teenage kids having sex?\nTheir dislike of the idea is so visceral it's probably inborn.  But\nif it's inborn it should be universal, and there are plenty of\nsocieties where parents don't mind if their teenage kids have\nsex—indeed, where it's normal for 14 year olds to become\nmothers.  So what's going on?  There does seem to be a universal\ntaboo against sex with prepubescent children.  One can imagine\nevolutionary reasons for that.  And I think this is the main reason\nparents in industrialized societies dislike teenage kids having\nsex.  They still think of them as children, even though biologically\nthey're not, so the taboo against child sex still has force.<br/><br/>One thing adults conceal about sex they also conceal about drugs:\nthat it can cause great pleasure.  That's what makes sex and drugs\nso dangerous. The desire for them can cloud one's judgement—which\nis especially frightening when the judgement being clouded is the\nalready wretched judgement of a teenage kid.<br/><br/>Here parents' desires conflict.  Older societies told kids they had\nbad judgement, but modern parents want their children to be confident.\nThis may well be a better plan than the old one of putting them in\ntheir place, but it has the side effect that after having implicitly\nlied to kids about how good their judgement is, we then have to lie\nagain about all the things they might get into trouble with if they\nbelieved us.<br/><br/>If parents told their kids the truth about sex and drugs, it would\nbe: the reason you should avoid these things is that you have lousy\njudgement.  People with twice your experience still get burned by\nthem.  But this may be one of those cases where the truth wouldn't\nbe convincing, because one of the symptoms of bad judgement is\nbelieving you have good judgement.  When you're too weak to lift\nsomething, you can tell, but when you're making a decision impetuously,\nyou're all the more sure of it.<br/><br/>\n<b>Innocence</b><br/><br/>Another reason parents don't want their kids having sex is that\nthey want to keep them innocent.  Adults have a certain model of\nhow kids are supposed to behave, and it's different from what they\nexpect of other adults.<br/><br/>One of the most obvious differences is the words kids are allowed\nto use.  Most parents use words when talking to other adults that\nthey wouldn't want their kids using.  They try to hide even the\nexistence of these words for as long as they can.  And this is\nanother of those conspiracies everyone participates in: everyone\nknows you're not supposed to swear in front of kids.<br/><br/>I've never heard more different explanations for anything parents\ntell kids than why they shouldn't swear.  Every parent I know forbids\ntheir children to swear, and yet no two of them have the same\njustification.  It's clear most start with not wanting kids to\nswear, then make up the reason afterward.<br/><br/>So my theory about what's going on is that the <i>function</i> of\nswearwords is to mark the speaker as an adult.  There's no difference\nin the meaning of \"shit\" and \"poopoo.\"  So why should one be ok for\nkids to say and one forbidden?  The only explanation is: by definition.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f3n\"><font color=\"#999999\">3</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Why does it bother adults so much when kids do things reserved for\nadults?   The idea of a foul-mouthed, cynical 10 year old leaning\nagainst a lamppost with a cigarette hanging out of the corner of\nhis mouth is very disconcerting.  But why?<br/><br/>One reason we want kids to be innocent is that we're programmed to\nlike certain kinds of helplessness.  I've several times heard mothers\nsay they deliberately refrained from correcting their young children's\nmispronunciations because they were so cute.  And if you think about\nit, cuteness is helplessness. Toys and cartoon characters meant to\nbe cute always have clueless expressions and stubby, ineffectual\nlimbs.<br/><br/>It's not surprising we'd have an inborn desire to love and protect\nhelpless creatures, considering human offspring are so helpless for\nso long.  Without the helplessness that makes kids cute, they'd be\nvery annoying.  They'd merely seem like incompetent adults.  But\nthere's more to it than that.  The reason our hypothetical jaded\n10 year old bothers me so much is not just that he'd be annoying,\nbut that he'd have cut off his prospects for growth so early.  To\nbe jaded you have to think you know how the world works, and any\ntheory a 10 year old had about that would probably be a pretty\nnarrow one.<br/><br/>Innocence is also open-mindedness.  We want kids to be innocent so\nthey can continue to learn.  Paradoxical as it sounds, there are\nsome kinds of knowledge that get in the way of other kinds of\nknowledge.  If you're going to learn that the world is a brutal\nplace full of people trying to take advantage of one another, you're\nbetter off learning it last.  Otherwise you won't bother learning\nmuch more.<br/><br/>Very smart adults often seem unusually innocent, and I don't think\nthis is a coincidence.  I think they've deliberately avoided learning\nabout certain things.  Certainly I do.  I used to think I wanted\nto know everything.  Now I know I don't.<br/><br/>\n<b>Death</b><br/><br/>After sex, death is the topic adults lie most conspicuously about\nto kids.  Sex I believe they conceal because of deep taboos.  But\nwhy do we conceal death from kids?   Probably because small children\nare particularly horrified by it.  They want to feel safe, and death\nis the ultimate threat.<br/><br/>One of the most spectacular lies our parents told us was about the\ndeath of our first cat.  Over the years, as we asked for more\ndetails, they were compelled to invent more, so the story grew quite\nelaborate.  The cat had died at the vet's office.  Of what?  Of the\nanaesthesia itself.  Why was the cat at the vet's office?  To be\nfixed.  And why had such a routine operation killed it?  It wasn't\nthe vet's fault; the cat had a congenitally weak heart; the anaesthesia\nwas too much for it; but there was no way anyone could have\nknown this in advance.  It was not till we were in our twenties\nthat the truth came out: my sister, then about three, had accidentally\nstepped on the cat and broken its back.<br/><br/>They didn't feel the need to tell us the cat was now happily in cat\nheaven.  My parents never claimed that people or animals who died\nhad \"gone to a better place,\" or that we'd meet them again.  It\ndidn't seem to harm us.<br/><br/>My grandmother told us an edited version of the death of my\ngrandfather.  She said they'd been sitting reading one day, and\nwhen she said something to him, he didn't answer.  He seemed to be\nasleep, but when she tried to rouse him, she couldn't.  \"He was\ngone.\" Having a heart attack sounded like falling asleep.  Later I\nlearned it hadn't been so neat, and the heart attack had taken most\nof a day to kill him.<br/><br/>Along with such outright lies, there must have been a lot of changing\nthe subject when death came up.  I can't remember that, of course,\nbut I can infer it from the fact that I didn't really grasp I was\ngoing to die till I was about 19.  How could I have missed something\nso obvious for so long?  Now that I've seen parents managing the\nsubject, I can see how: questions about death are gently but firmly\nturned aside.<br/><br/>On this topic, especially, they're met half-way by kids.  Kids often\nwant to be lied to.  They want to believe they're living in a\ncomfortable, safe world as much as their parents want them to believe\nit.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f4n\"><font color=\"#999999\">4</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>\n<b>Identity</b><br/><br/>Some parents feel a strong adherence to an ethnic or religious group\nand want their kids to feel it too.  This usually requires two\ndifferent kinds of lying: the first is to tell the child that he\nor she is an X, and the second is whatever specific lies Xes\ndifferentiate themselves by believing.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f5n\"><font color=\"#999999\">5</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Telling a child they have a particular ethnic or religious identity\nis one of the stickiest things you can tell them.  Almost anything\nelse you tell a kid, they can change their mind about later when\nthey start to think for themselves.  But if you tell a kid they're\na member of a certain group, that seems nearly impossible to shake.<br/><br/>This despite the fact that it can be one of the most premeditated\nlies parents tell.  When parents are of different religions, they'll\noften agree between themselves that their children will be \"raised\nas Xes.\"  And it works. The kids obligingly grow up considering\nthemselves as Xes, despite the fact that if their parents had chosen\nthe other way, they'd have grown up considering themselves as Ys.<br/><br/>One reason this works so well is the second kind of lie involved.\nThe truth is common property.  You can't distinguish your group by\ndoing things that are rational, and believing things that are true.\nIf you want to set yourself apart from other people, you have to\ndo things that are arbitrary, and believe things that are false.\nAnd after having spent their whole lives doing things that are arbitrary\nand believing things that are false, and being regarded as odd by\n\"outsiders\" on that account, the cognitive dissonance pushing\nchildren to regard themselves as Xes must be enormous.  If they\naren't an X, why are they attached to all these arbitrary beliefs\nand customs?  If they aren't an X, why do all the non-Xes call them\none?<br/><br/>This form of lie is not without its uses.  You can use it to carry\na payload of beneficial beliefs, and they will also become part of\nthe child's identity.  You can tell the child that in addition to\nnever wearing the color yellow, believing the world was created by\na giant rabbit, and always snapping their fingers before eating\nfish, Xes are also particularly honest and industrious.  Then X\nchildren will grow up feeling it's part of their identity to be\nhonest and industrious.<br/><br/>This probably accounts for a lot of the spread of modern religions,\nand explains why their doctrines are a combination of the useful\nand the bizarre.  The bizarre half is what makes the religion stick,\nand the useful half is the payload.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f6n\"><font color=\"#999999\">6</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>\n<b>Authority</b><br/><br/>One of the least excusable reasons adults lie to kids is to maintain\npower over them.  Sometimes these lies are truly sinister, like a\nchild molester telling his victims they'll get in trouble if they\ntell anyone what happened to them.  Others seem more innocent; it\ndepends how badly adults lie to maintain their power, and what they\nuse it for.<br/><br/>Most adults make some effort to conceal their flaws from children.\nUsually their motives are mixed.  For example, a father who has an\naffair generally conceals it from his children.  His motive is\npartly that it would worry them, partly that this would introduce\nthe topic of sex, and partly (a larger part than he would admit)\nthat he doesn't want to tarnish himself in their eyes.<br/><br/>If you want to learn what lies are told to kids, read almost any\nbook written to teach them about \"issues.\"\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f7n\"><font color=\"#999999\">7</font></a>]</font>\nPeter Mayle wrote\none called <i>Why Are We Getting a Divorce?</i>  It begins with the three\nmost important things to remember about divorce, one of which is:\n<blockquote>\n  You shouldn't put the blame on one parent, because divorce is\n  never only one person's fault.\n  <font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f8n\"><font color=\"#999999\">8</font></a>]</font>\n</blockquote>\nReally?  When a man runs off with his secretary, is it always partly\nhis wife's fault?  But I can see why Mayle might have said this.\nMaybe it's more important for kids to respect their parents than\nto know the truth about them.<br/><br/>But because adults conceal their flaws, and at the same time insist\non high standards of behavior for kids, a lot of kids grow up feeling\nthey fall hopelessly short.  They walk around feeling horribly evil\nfor having used a swearword, while in fact most of the adults around\nthem are doing much worse things.<br/><br/>This happens in intellectual as well as moral questions.  The more\nconfident people are, the more willing they seem to be to answer a\nquestion \"I don't know.\"  Less confident people feel they have to\nhave an answer or they'll look bad.  My parents were pretty good\nabout admitting when they didn't know things, but I must have been\ntold a lot of lies of this type by teachers, because I rarely heard\na teacher say \"I don't know\" till I got to college.  I remember\nbecause it was so surprising to hear someone say that in front of\na class.<br/><br/>The first hint I had that teachers weren't omniscient came in sixth\ngrade, after my father contradicted something I'd learned in school.\nWhen I protested that the teacher had said the opposite, my father\nreplied that the guy had no idea what he was talking about—that\nhe was just an elementary school teacher, after all.<br/><br/><i>Just</i> a teacher?  The phrase seemed almost grammatically ill-formed.\nDidn't teachers know everything about the subjects they taught?\nAnd if not, why were they the ones teaching us?<br/><br/>The sad fact is, US public school teachers don't generally understand\nthe stuff they're teaching very well.  There are some sterling\nexceptions, but as a rule people planning to go into teaching rank\nacademically near the bottom of the college population.  So the\nfact that I still thought at age 11 that teachers were infallible\nshows what a job the system must have done on my brain.<br/><br/>\n<b>School</b><br/><br/>What kids get taught in school is a complex mix of lies.  The most\nexcusable are those told to simplify ideas to make them easy to\nlearn.  The problem is, a lot of propaganda gets slipped into the\ncurriculum in the name of simplification.<br/><br/>Public school textbooks represent a compromise between what various\npowerful groups want kids to be told.  The lies are rarely overt.\nUsually they consist either of omissions or of over-emphasizing\ncertain topics at the expense of others.  The view of history we\ngot in elementary school was a crude hagiography, with at least one\nrepresentative of each powerful group.<br/><br/>The famous scientists I remember were Einstein, Marie Curie, and\nGeorge Washington Carver.   Einstein was a big deal because his\nwork led to the atom bomb.  Marie Curie was involved with X-rays.\nBut I was mystified about Carver.  He seemed to have done stuff\nwith peanuts.<br/><br/>It's obvious now that he was on the list because he was black (and\nfor that matter that Marie Curie was on it because she was a woman),\nbut as a kid I was confused for years about him.  I wonder if it\nwouldn't have been better just to tell us the truth: that there\nweren't any famous black scientists.  Ranking George Washington\nCarver with Einstein misled us not only about science, but about\nthe obstacles blacks faced in his time.<br/><br/>As subjects got softer, the lies got more frequent.  By the time\nyou got to politics and recent history, what we were taught was\npretty much pure propaganda.  For example, we were taught to regard\npolitical leaders as saints—especially the recently martyred\nKennedy and King.  It was astonishing to learn later that they'd\nboth been serial womanizers, and that Kennedy was a speed freak to\nboot.  (By the time King's plagiarism emerged, I'd lost the ability\nto be surprised by the misdeeds of famous people.)<br/><br/>I doubt you could teach kids recent history without teaching them\nlies, because practically everyone who has anything to say about\nit has some kind of spin to put on it.  Much recent history <i>consists</i>\nof spin.  It would probably be better just to teach them metafacts\nlike that.<br/><br/>Probably the biggest lie told in schools, though, is that the way\nto succeed is through following \"the rules.\"  In fact most such\nrules are just hacks to manage large groups efficiently.<br/><br/>\n<b>Peace</b><br/><br/>Of all the reasons we lie to kids, the most powerful is probably\nthe same mundane reason they lie to us.<br/><br/>Often when we lie to people it's not part of any conscious strategy,\nbut because they'd react violently to the truth.  Kids, almost by\ndefinition, lack self-control.  They react violently to things—and\nso they get lied to a lot. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f9n\"><font color=\"#999999\">9</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>A few Thanksgivings ago, a friend of mine found himself in a situation\nthat perfectly illustrates the complex motives we have when we lie\nto kids.  As the roast turkey appeared on the table, his alarmingly\nperceptive 5 year old son suddenly asked if the turkey had wanted\nto die.  Foreseeing disaster, my friend and his wife rapidly\nimprovised: yes, the turkey had wanted to die, and in fact had lived\nits whole life with the aim of being their Thanksgiving dinner.\nAnd that (phew) was the end of that.<br/><br/>Whenever we lie to kids to protect them, we're usually also lying\nto keep the peace.<br/><br/>One consequence of this sort of calming lie is that we grow up\nthinking horrible things are normal.  It's hard for us to feel a\nsense of urgency as adults over something we've literally been\ntrained not to worry about.  When I was about 10 I saw a documentary\non pollution that put me into a panic.  It seemed the planet was\nbeing irretrievably ruined.  I went to my mother afterward to ask\nif this was so.  I don't remember what she said, but she made me\nfeel better, so I stopped worrying about it.<br/><br/>That was probably the best way to handle a frightened 10 year old.\nBut we should understand the price.  This sort of lie is one of the\nmain reasons bad things persist: we're all trained to ignore them.<br/><br/>\n<b>Detox</b><br/><br/>A sprinter in a race almost immediately enters a state called \"oxygen\ndebt.\"  His body switches to an emergency source of energy that's\nfaster than regular aerobic respiration.  But this process builds\nup waste products that ultimately require extra oxygen to break\ndown, so at the end of the race he has to stop and pant for a while\nto recover.<br/><br/>We arrive at adulthood with a kind of truth debt.  We were told a\nlot of lies to get us (and our parents) through our childhood.  Some\nmay have been necessary.  Some probably weren't.  But we all arrive\nat adulthood with heads full of lies.<br/><br/>There's never a point where the adults sit you down and explain all\nthe lies they told you.  They've forgotten most of them.  So if\nyou're going to clear these lies out of your head, you're going to\nhave to do it yourself.<br/><br/>Few do.  Most people go through life with bits of packing material\nadhering to their minds and never know it.  You probably never can\ncompletely undo the effects of lies you were told as a kid, but\nit's worth trying.  I've found that whenever I've been able to undo\na lie I was told, a lot of other things fell into place.<br/><br/>Fortunately, once you arrive at adulthood you get a valuable new\nresource you can use to figure out what lies you were told.  You're\nnow one of the liars.  You get to watch behind the scenes as adults\nspin the world for the next generation of kids.<br/><br/>The first step in clearing your head is to realize how far you are\nfrom a neutral observer.  When I left high school I was, I thought,\na complete skeptic.  I'd realized high school was crap.  I thought\nI was ready to question everything I knew.  But among the many other\nthings I was ignorant of was how much debris there already was in\nmy head.  It's not enough to consider your mind a blank slate.  You\nhave to consciously erase it.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nOne reason I stuck with such a brutally simple word is that\nthe lies we tell kids are probably not quite as harmless as we\nthink.  If you look at what adults told children in the past, it's\nshocking how much they lied to them.  Like us, they did it with the\nbest intentions.  So if we think we're as open as one could reasonably\nbe with children, we're probably fooling ourselves.  Odds are people\nin 100 years will be as shocked at some of the lies we tell as we\nare at some of the lies people told 100 years ago.<br/><br/>I can't predict which these will be, and I don't want to write an\nessay that will seem dumb in 100 years.  So instead of using special\neuphemisms for lies that seem excusable according to present fashions,\nI'm just going to call all our lies lies.<br/><br/>(I have omitted one type: lies told to play games with kids'\ncredulity.  These range from \"make-believe,\" which is not really a\nlie because it's told with a wink, to the frightening lies told by\nolder siblings.   There's not much to say about these: I wouldn't\nwant the first type to go away, and wouldn't expect the second type\nto.)<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nCalaprice, Alice (ed.), <i>The Quotable Einstein</i>, Princeton\nUniversity Press, 1996.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nIf you ask parents why kids shouldn't swear, the less educated\nones usually reply with some question-begging answer like \"it's\ninappropriate,\" while the more educated ones come up with elaborate\nrationalizations.  In fact the less educated parents seem closer\nto the truth.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f4n\"><font color=\"#000000\">4</font></a>]\nAs a friend with small children pointed out, it's easy for small\nchildren to consider themselves immortal, because time seems to\npass so slowly for them.  To a 3 year old, a day feels like a month\nmight to an adult.  So 80 years sounds to him like 2400 years would\nto us.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f5n\"><font color=\"#000000\">5</font></a>]\nI realize I'm going to get endless grief for classifying religion\nas a type of lie.  Usually people skirt that issue with some\nequivocation implying that lies believed for a sufficiently long\ntime by sufficiently large numbers of people are immune to the usual\nstandards for truth.  But because I can't predict which lies future\ngenerations will consider inexcusable, I can't safely omit any type\nwe tell.  Yes, it seems unlikely that religion will be out of fashion\nin 100 years, but no more unlikely than it would have seemed to\nsomeone in 1880 that schoolchildren in 1980 would be taught that\nmasturbation was perfectly normal and not to feel guilty about it.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f6n\"><font color=\"#000000\">6</font></a>]\nUnfortunately the payload can consist of bad customs as well\nas good ones.  For example, there are certain qualities that some\ngroups in America consider \"acting white.\"  In fact most of them\ncould as accurately be called \"acting Japanese.\"  There's nothing\nspecifically white about such customs. They're common to all cultures\nwith long traditions of living in cities.  So it is probably a\nlosing bet for a group to consider behaving the opposite way as\npart of its identity.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f7n\"><font color=\"#000000\">7</font></a>]\nIn this context, \"issues\" basically means \"things we're going\nto lie to them about.\"  That's why there's a special name for these\ntopics.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f8n\"><font color=\"#000000\">8</font></a>]\nMayle, Peter, <i>Why Are We Getting a Divorce?</i>, Harmony, 1988.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f9n\"><font color=\"#000000\">9</font></a>]\nThe ironic thing is, this is also the main reason kids lie to\nadults.  If you freak out when people tell you alarming things,\nthey won't tell you them.  Teenagers don't tell their parents what\nhappened that night they were supposed to be staying at a friend's\nhouse for the same reason parents don't tell 5 year olds the truth\nabout the Thanksgiving turkey.  They'd freak if they knew.<br/><br/>\n<b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Marc Andreessen, Trevor Blackwell,\nPatrick Collison, Jessica Livingston, Jackie McDonough, Robert\nMorris, and David Sloo for reading drafts of this.  And since there\nare some controversial ideas here, I should add that none of them\nagreed with everything in it.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2008-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
