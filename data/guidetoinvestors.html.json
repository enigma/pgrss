{"href":"guidetoinvestors.html","title":"The Hacker's Guide to Investors","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">April 2007<br/><br/><i>(This essay is derived from a keynote talk at the 2007 ASES Summit\nat Stanford.)</i><br/><br/>The world of investors is a foreign one to most hackers—partly\nbecause investors are so unlike hackers, and partly because they\ntend to operate in secret.  I've been dealing with this world for\nmany years, both as a founder and an investor, and I still don't\nfully understand it.<br/><br/>In this essay I'm going to list some of the more surprising things\nI've learned about investors.  Some I only learned in the past year.<br/><br/>Teaching hackers how to deal with investors is probably the second\nmost important thing we do at Y Combinator.  The most important\nthing for a startup is to make something good.  But everyone knows\nthat's important.  The dangerous thing about investors is that\nhackers don't know how little they know about this strange world.<br/><br/><b>1. The investors are what make a startup hub.</b><br/><br/>About a year ago I tried to figure out what you'd need to reproduce\n<a href=\"siliconvalley.html\">Silicon Valley</a>.  I decided the \ncritical ingredients were rich people\nand nerds—investors and founders.  People are all you need to\nmake technology, and all the other people will move.<br/><br/>If I had to narrow that down, I'd say investors are the limiting\nfactor.  Not because they contribute more to the startup, but simply\nbecause they're least willing to move.  They're rich.  They're not\ngoing to move to Albuquerque just because there are some smart\nhackers there they could invest in.  Whereas hackers will move to\nthe Bay Area to find investors.<br/><br/><b>2. Angel investors are the most critical.</b><br/><br/>There are several types of investors.  The two main categories are\nangels and VCs: VCs invest other people's money, and angels invest\ntheir own.<br/><br/>Though they're less well known, the angel investors are probably\nthe more critical ingredient in creating a silicon valley.  Most\ncompanies that VCs invest in would never have made it that far if angels\nhadn't invested first.  VCs say between half and three quarters of\ncompanies that raise series A rounds have taken some outside\ninvestment already.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f1n\"><font color=\"#777777\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Angels are willing to fund riskier projects than VCs.  They also\ngive valuable advice, because (unlike VCs) many have been startup\nfounders themselves.<br/><br/>Google's story shows the key role angels play. A lot of people know\nGoogle raised money from Kleiner and Sequoia.  What most don't realize\nis how late.  That VC round was a series B round; the premoney\nvaluation was $75 million.  Google was already a successful company\nat that point.  Really, Google was funded with angel money.<br/><br/>It may seem odd that the canonical Silicon Valley startup was funded\nby angels, but this is not so surprising.  Risk is always proportionate\nto reward.  So the most successful startup of all is likely to have\nseemed an extremely risky bet at first, and that is exactly the\nkind VCs won't touch.<br/><br/>Where do angel investors come from?  From other startups.  So startup\nhubs like Silicon Valley benefit from something like the marketplace\neffect, but shifted in time: startups are there because startups\nwere there.<br/><br/><b>3. Angels don't like publicity.</b><br/><br/>If angels are so important, why do we hear more about VCs?  Because\nVCs like publicity.  They need to market themselves to the investors\nwho are their \"customers\"—the endowments and pension funds and\nrich families whose money they invest—and also to founders who\nmight come to them for funding.<br/><br/>Angels don't need to market themselves to investors because they\ninvest their own money.  Nor do they want to market themselves to\nfounders: they don't want random people pestering them with business\nplans.  Actually, neither do VCs.  Both angels and VCs get deals\nalmost exclusively through personal introductions.  \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f2n\"><font color=\"#777777\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The reason VCs want a strong brand is not to draw in more business\nplans over the transom, but so they win deals when competing\nagainst other VCs.  Whereas angels are rarely in direct competition,\nbecause (a) they do fewer deals, (b) they're happy to split them,\nand (c) they invest at a point where the stream is broader.<br/><br/><b>4. Most investors, especially VCs, are not like founders.</b><br/><br/>Some angels are, or were, hackers.  But most VCs are a different\ntype of people: they're dealmakers.<br/><br/>If you're a hacker, here's a thought experiment you can run to\nunderstand why there are basically no hacker VCs: How would you\nlike a job where you never got to make anything, but instead spent\nall your time listening to other people pitch (mostly terrible)\nprojects, deciding whether to fund them, and sitting on their boards\nif you did?  That would not be fun for most hackers.  Hackers like\nto make things.  This would be like being an administrator.<br/><br/>Because most VCs are a different species of people from\nfounders, it's hard to know what they're thinking.  If you're a\nhacker, the last time you had to deal with these guys was in high\nschool.  Maybe in college you walked past their fraternity on your\nway to the lab.  But don't underestimate them.  They're as expert\nin their world as you are in yours.  What they're good at is reading\npeople, and making deals work to their advantage.  Think twice\nbefore you try to beat them at that.<br/><br/><b>5. Most investors are momentum investors.</b><br/><br/>Because most investors are dealmakers rather than technology people,\nthey generally don't understand what you're doing.  I knew as a\nfounder that most VCs didn't get technology.  I also knew some made\na lot of money.  And yet it never occurred to me till recently to\nput those two ideas together and ask \"How can VCs make money by\ninvesting in stuff they don't understand?\"<br/><br/>The answer is that they're like momentum investors.  You can (or\ncould once) make a lot of money by noticing sudden changes in stock\nprices.  When a stock jumps upward, you buy, and when it suddenly\ndrops, you sell.  In effect you're insider trading, without knowing\nwhat you know.  You just know someone knows something, and that's\nmaking the stock move.<br/><br/>This is how most venture investors operate.  They don't try to look\nat something and predict whether it will take off.  They win by\nnoticing that something <i>is</i> taking off a little sooner than everyone\nelse.  That generates almost as good returns as actually being able\nto pick winners.  They may have to pay a little more than they would\nif they got in at the very beginning, but only a little.<br/><br/>Investors always say what they really care about is the team.\nActually what they care most about is your traffic, then what other\ninvestors think, then the team.  If you don't yet have any traffic,\nthey fall back on number 2, what other investors think.  And this,\nas you can imagine, produces wild oscillations in the \"stock price\"\nof a startup.  One week everyone wants you, and they're begging not\nto be cut out of the deal.  But all it takes is for one big investor\nto cool on you, and the next week no one will return your phone\ncalls.  We regularly have startups go from hot to cold or cold to\nhot in a matter of days, and literally nothing has changed.<br/><br/>There are two ways to deal with this phenomenon.  If you're feeling\nreally confident, you can try to ride it.  You can start by asking\na comparatively lowly VC for a small amount of money, and then after\ngenerating interest there, ask more prestigious VCs for larger\namounts, stirring up a crescendo of buzz, and then \"sell\" at the\ntop.  This is extremely risky, and takes months even if you succeed.\nI wouldn't try it myself.  My advice is to err on the side of safety:\nwhen someone offers you a decent deal, just take it and get on with\nbuilding the company.  Startups win or lose based on the quality\nof their product, not the quality of their funding deals.<br/><br/><b>6. Most investors are looking for big hits.</b><br/><br/>Venture investors like companies that could go public.  That's where\nthe big returns are.  They know the odds of any individual startup\ngoing public are small, but they want to invest in those that at\nleast have a <i>chance</i> of going public.<br/><br/>Currently the way VCs seem to operate is to invest in a bunch of\ncompanies, most of which fail, and one of which is Google.  Those\nfew big wins compensate for losses on their other investments.  What this\nmeans is that most VCs will only invest in you if you're a potential\nGoogle.  They don't care about companies that are a safe bet to be\nacquired for $20 million.  There needs to be a chance, however\nsmall, of the company becoming really big.<br/><br/>Angels are different in this respect.  They're happy to invest in\na company where the most likely outcome is a $20 million acquisition\nif they can do it at a low enough valuation.  But of course they\nlike companies that could go public too.  So having an ambitious\nlong-term plan pleases everyone.<br/><br/>If you take VC money, you have to mean it, because the structure\nof VC deals prevents early acquisitions.  If you take VC money,\nthey won't let you sell early.<br/><br/><b>7. VCs want to invest large amounts.</b><br/><br/>The fact that they're running investment funds makes VCs want to\ninvest large amounts.  A typical VC fund is now hundreds of millions\nof dollars.  If $400 million has to be invested by 10 partners,\nthey have to invest $40 million each.  VCs usually sit on the boards\nof companies they fund.  If the average deal size was $1 million,\neach partner would have to sit on 40 boards, which would not be\nfun.  So they prefer bigger deals, where they can put a lot of money\nto work at once.<br/><br/>VCs don't regard you as a bargain if you don't need a lot of money.\nThat may even make you less attractive, because it means their\ninvestment creates less of a barrier to entry for competitors.<br/><br/>Angels are in a different position because they're investing their\nown money.  They're happy to invest small amounts—sometimes as\nlittle as $20,000—as long as the potential returns look good\nenough.  So if you're doing something inexpensive, go to angels.<br/><br/><b>8. Valuations are fiction.</b><br/><br/>VCs admit that valuations are an artifact.  They decide how much\nmoney you need and how much of the company they want, and those two\nconstraints yield a valuation.<br/><br/>Valuations increase as the size of the investment does.  A company\nthat an angel is willing to put $50,000 into at a valuation of a\nmillion can't take $6 million from VCs at that valuation.  That\nwould leave the founders less than a seventh of the company between\nthem (since the option pool would also come out of that seventh).\nMost VCs wouldn't want that, which is why you never hear of deals\nwhere a VC invests $6 million at a premoney valuation of $1 million.<br/><br/>If valuations change depending on the amount invested, that shows\nhow far they are from reflecting any kind of value of the company.<br/><br/>Since valuations are made up, founders shouldn't care too much about\nthem.  That's not the part to focus on.  In fact, a high valuation\ncan be a bad thing.  If you take funding at a premoney valuation\nof $10 million, you won't be selling the company for 20.  You'll\nhave to sell for over 50 for the VCs to get even a 5x return, which\nis low to them.  More likely they'll want you to hold out for 100.\nBut needing to get a high price decreases the chance of getting\nbought at all; many companies can buy you for $10 million, but only\na handful for 100.  And since a startup is like a pass/fail course\nfor the founders, what you want to optimize is your chance of a\ngood outcome, not the percentage of the company you keep.<br/><br/>So why do founders chase high valuations?  They're tricked by\nmisplaced ambition.  They feel they've achieved more if they get a\nhigher valuation.  They usually know other founders, and if they\nget a higher valuation they can say \"mine is bigger than yours.\"\nBut funding is not the real test.  The real test is the final outcome\nfor the founder, and getting too high a valuation may just make a\ngood outcome less likely.<br/><br/>The one advantage of a high valuation is that you get less dilution.\nBut there is another less sexy way to achieve that: just take less\nmoney.<br/><br/><b>9. Investors look for founders like the current stars.</b><br/><br/>Ten years ago investors were looking for the next Bill Gates.  This\nwas a mistake, because Microsoft was a very anomalous startup.  They\nstarted almost as a contract programming operation, and the reason\nthey became huge was that IBM happened to drop the PC standard in\ntheir lap.<br/><br/>Now all the VCs are looking for the next Larry and Sergey.  This\nis a good trend, because Larry and Sergey are closer to the ideal\nstartup founders.<br/><br/>Historically investors thought it was important for a founder to\nbe an expert in business.  So they were willing to fund teams of\nMBAs who planned to use the money to pay programmers to build their\nproduct for them.  This is like funding Steve Ballmer in the hope\nthat the programmer he'll hire is Bill Gates—kind of backward,\nas the events of the Bubble showed.  Now most VCs know they should\nbe funding technical guys.  This is more pronounced among the very\ntop funds; the lamer ones still want to fund MBAs.<br/><br/>If you're a hacker, it's good news that investors are looking for\nLarry and Sergey.  The bad news is, the only investors who can do\nit right are the ones who knew them when they were a\ncouple of CS grad students, not the confident media stars they are\ntoday.  What investors still don't get is how clueless and tentative\ngreat founders can seem at the very beginning.<br/><br/><b>10. The contribution of investors tends to be underestimated.</b><br/><br/>Investors do more for startups than give them money.  They're helpful\nin doing deals and arranging introductions, and some of the smarter\nones, particularly angels, can give good advice about the product.<br/><br/>In fact, I'd say what separates the great investors from the mediocre\nones is the quality of their advice.  Most investors give advice,\nbut the top ones give <i>good</i> advice.<br/><br/>Whatever help investors give a startup tends to be underestimated.\nIt's to everyone's advantage to let the world think the founders\nthought of everything.  The goal of the investors is for the company\nto become valuable, and the company seems more valuable if it seems\nlike all the good ideas came from within.<br/><br/>This trend is compounded by the obsession that the press has with\nfounders.  In a company founded by two people, 10% of the ideas\nmight come from the first guy they hire.  Arguably they've done a\nbad job of hiring otherwise.  And yet this guy will be almost\nentirely overlooked by the press.<br/><br/>I say this as a founder: the contribution of founders is always\noverestimated.  The danger here is that new founders, looking at\nexisting founders, will think that they're supermen that one couldn't\npossibly equal oneself.  Actually they have a hundred different\ntypes of support people just offscreen making the whole show possible.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f3n\"><font color=\"#777777\">3</font></a>]</font><br/><br/><b>11. VCs are afraid of looking bad.</b><br/><br/>I've been very surprised to discover how timid most VCs are.  They\nseem to be afraid of looking bad to their partners, and perhaps\nalso to the limited partners—the people whose money they invest.<br/><br/>You can measure this fear in how much less risk VCs are willing to\ntake.  You can tell they won't make investments for their fund that\nthey might be willing to make themselves as angels.  Though it's\nnot quite accurate to say that VCs are less willing to take risks.\nThey're less willing to do things that might look bad.  That's not\nthe same thing.<br/><br/>For example, most VCs would be very reluctant to invest in a startup\nfounded by a pair of 18 year old hackers, no matter how brilliant,\nbecause if the startup failed their partners could turn on them and\nsay \"What, you invested $x million of our money in a pair of 18\nyear olds?\"  Whereas if a VC invested in a startup founded by\nthree former banking executives in their 40s who planned to outsource\ntheir product development—which to my mind is actually a lot\nriskier than investing in a pair of really smart 18 year olds—he\ncouldn't be faulted, if it failed, for making such an apparently\nprudent investment.<br/><br/>As a friend of mine said, \"Most VCs can't do anything that would\nsound bad to the kind of doofuses who run pension funds.\" Angels\ncan take greater risks because they don't have to answer to anyone.<br/><br/><b>12. Being turned down by investors doesn't mean much.</b><br/><br/>Some founders are quite dejected when they get turned down by\ninvestors.  They shouldn't take it so much to heart.  To start with,\ninvestors are often wrong.  It's hard to think of a successful\nstartup that wasn't turned down by investors at some point.  Lots\nof VCs rejected Google.  So obviously the reaction of investors is\nnot a very meaningful test.<br/><br/>Investors will often reject you for what seem to be superficial\nreasons.  I read of one VC who \n<a href=\"http://ricksegal.typepad.com/pmv/2007/02/a_fatal_paper_c.html\">turned\ndown</a> a startup simply because\nthey'd given away so many little bits of stock that the deal required\ntoo many signatures to close. \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f4n\"><font color=\"#777777\">4</font></a>]</font>\nThe reason investors can get away\nwith this is that they see so many deals.  It doesn't matter if\nthey underestimate you because of some surface imperfection, because\nthe next best deal will be <a href=\"judgement.html\">almost as good</a>.  \nImagine picking out\napples at a grocery store.  You grab one with a little bruise.\nMaybe it's just a surface bruise, but why even bother checking when\nthere are so many other unbruised apples to choose from?<br/><br/>Investors would be the first to admit they're often wrong.  So when\nyou get rejected by investors, don't think \"we suck,\" but instead\nask \"do we suck?\"  Rejection is a question, not an answer.<br/><br/><b>13. Investors are emotional.</b><br/><br/>I've been surprised to discover how emotional investors can be.\nYou'd expect them to be cold and calculating, or at least businesslike,\nbut often they're not.  I'm not sure if it's their position of power\nthat makes them this way, or the large sums of money involved, but\ninvestment negotiations can easily turn personal.  If you offend\ninvestors, they'll leave in a huff.<br/><br/>A while ago an eminent VC firm offered a series A round to a startup\nwe'd seed funded.  Then they heard a rival VC firm was also interested.\nThey were so afraid that they'd be rejected in favor of this other\nfirm that they gave the startup what's known as an \"exploding\ntermsheet.\"  They had, I think, 24 hours to say yes or no, or the\ndeal was off.  Exploding termsheets are a somewhat dubious device,\nbut not uncommon.  What surprised me was their reaction when I\ncalled to talk about it.  I asked if they'd still be interested in\nthe startup if the rival VC didn't end up making an offer, and they\nsaid no.  What rational basis could they have had for saying that?\nIf they thought the startup was worth investing in, what difference\nshould it make what some other VC thought?  Surely it was their\nduty to their limited partners simply to invest in the best\nopportunities they found; they should be delighted if the other VC\nsaid no, because it would mean they'd overlooked a good opportunity.\nBut of course there was no rational basis for their decision.  They\njust couldn't stand the idea of taking this rival firm's rejects.<br/><br/>In this case the exploding termsheet was not (or not only) a tactic\nto pressure the startup.  It was more like the high school trick\nof breaking up with someone before they can break up with you.  In\nan <a href=\"startupfunding.html\">earlier essay</a> I said that VCs were a lot like high school girls.\nA few VCs have joked about that characterization, but none have\ndisputed it.<br/><br/><b>14. The negotiation never stops till the closing.</b><br/><br/>Most deals, for investment or acquisition, happen in two phases.\nThere's an initial phase of negotiation about the big questions.\nIf this succeeds you get a termsheet, so called because it outlines\nthe key terms of a deal.  A termsheet is not legally binding,\nbut it is a definite step.  It's supposed to mean that a\ndeal is going to happen, once the lawyers work out all the details.\nIn theory these details are minor ones; by definition all the\nimportant points are supposed to be covered in the termsheet.<br/><br/>Inexperience and wishful thinking combine to make founders feel\nthat when they have a termsheet, they have a deal.  They want there\nto be a deal; everyone acts like they have a deal; so there must\nbe a deal.  But there isn't and may not be for several months.  A\nlot can change for a startup in several months.  It's not uncommon\nfor investors and acquirers to get buyer's remorse.  So you have\nto keep pushing, keep selling, all the way to the close.  Otherwise\nall the \"minor\" details left unspecified in the termsheet will be\ninterpreted to your disadvantage.  The other side may even break\nthe deal; if they do that, they'll usually seize on some technicality\nor claim you misled them, rather than admitting they changed their\nminds.<br/><br/>It can be hard to keep the pressure on an investor or acquirer all\nthe way to the closing, because the most effective pressure is\ncompetition from other investors or acquirers, and these tend to\ndrop away when you get a termsheet.  You should try to stay as close\nfriends as you can with these rivals, but the most important thing\nis just to keep up the momentum in your startup.  The investors or\nacquirers chose you because you seemed hot.  Keep doing whatever\nmade you seem hot.  Keep releasing new features; keep getting new\nusers; keep getting mentioned in the press and in blogs.<br/><br/><b>15. Investors like to co-invest.</b><br/><br/>I've been surprised how willing investors are to split deals.  You\nmight think that if they found a good deal they'd want it all to\nthemselves, but they seem positively eager to syndicate.  This is\nunderstandable with angels; they invest on a smaller scale and don't\nlike to have too much money tied up in any one deal.  But VCs also\nshare deals a lot.  Why?<br/><br/>Partly I think this is an artifact of the rule I quoted earlier:\nafter traffic, VCs care most what other VCs think.  A deal that has\nmultiple VCs interested in it is more likely to close, so of deals\nthat close, more will have multiple investors.<br/><br/>There is one rational reason to want multiple VCs in a deal: Any\ninvestor who co-invests with you is one less investor who could\nfund a competitor.  Apparently Kleiner and Sequoia didn't like\nsplitting the Google deal, but it did at least have the advantage,\nfrom each one's point of view, that there probably wouldn't be a\ncompetitor funded by the other.  Splitting deals thus has similar\nadvantages to confusing paternity.<br/><br/>But I think the main reason VCs like splitting deals is the fear\nof looking bad.  If another firm shares the deal, then in the event\nof failure it will seem to have been a prudent choice—a consensus\ndecision, rather than just the whim of an individual partner.<br/><br/><b>16. Investors collude.</b><br/><br/>Investing is not covered by antitrust law.  At least, it better not\nbe, because investors regularly do things that would be illegal\notherwise.  I know personally of cases where one investor has talked\nanother out of making a competitive offer, using the promise of\nsharing future deals.<br/><br/>In principle investors are all competing for the same deals, but\nthe spirit of cooperation is stronger than the spirit of competition.\nThe reason, again, is that there are so many deals.  Though a\nprofessional investor may have a closer relationship with a founder\nhe invests in than with other investors, his relationship with the\nfounder is only going to last a couple years, whereas his relationship\nwith other firms will last his whole career.  There isn't so much\nat stake in his interactions with other investors, but there will\nbe a lot of them.  Professional investors are constantly trading\nlittle favors.<br/><br/>Another reason investors stick together is to preserve the power\nof investors as a whole.  So you will not, as of this writing, be\nable to get investors into an auction for your series A round.\nThey'd rather lose the deal than establish a precedent of VCs\ncompetitively bidding against one another.  An efficient startup\nfunding market may be coming in the distant future; things tend to\nmove in that direction; but it's certainly not here now.\n<!--\nThe best way to describe the situation might be to say that VCs\ncompete intramurally. --><br/><br/><b>17. Large-scale investors care about their portfolio, not any\nindividual company.</b><br/><br/>The reason startups work so well is that everyone with power also\nhas equity.  The only way any of them can succeed is if they all\ndo.  This makes everyone naturally pull in the same direction,\nsubject to differences of opinion about tactics.<br/><br/>The problem is, larger scale investors don't have exactly the same\nmotivation.  Close, but not identical. They don't need any given\nstartup to succeed, like founders do, just their portfolio as a\nwhole to.  So in borderline cases the rational thing for them to\ndo is to sacrifice unpromising startups.<br/><br/>Large-scale investors tend to put startups in three categories:\nsuccesses, failures, and the \"living dead\"—companies that are\nplugging along but don't seem likely in the immediate future to get\nbought or go public.  To the founders, \"living dead\" sounds harsh.\nThese companies may be far from failures by ordinary standards. But\nthey might as well be from a venture investor's point of view, and\nthey suck up just as much time and attention as the successes.  So\nif such a company has two possible strategies, a conservative one\nthat's slightly more likely to work in the end, or a risky one that\nwithin a short time will either yield a giant success or kill the\ncompany, VCs will push for the kill-or-cure option.  To them the\ncompany is already a write-off.  Better to have resolution, one way\nor the other, as soon as possible.<br/><br/>If a startup gets into real trouble, instead of trying to save it\nVCs may just sell it at a low price to another of their portfolio\ncompanies.  Philip Greenspun said in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590597141\"><i>Founders at Work</i></a> that Ars Digita's VCs did this to them.<br/><br/><b>18. Investors have different risk profiles from founders.</b><br/><br/>Most people would rather a 100% chance of $1 million than a 20%\nchance of $10 million.  Investors are rich enough to be rational\nand prefer the latter.  So they'll always tend to encourage founders\nto keep rolling the dice.  If a company is doing well, investors\nwill want founders to turn down most acquisition offers.  And indeed,\nmost startups that turn down acquisition offers ultimately do better.\nBut it's still hair-raising for the founders, because they might\nend up with nothing.  When someone's offering to buy you for a price\nat which your stock is worth $5 million, saying no is equivalent\nto having $5 million and betting it all on one spin of the roulette\nwheel.<br/><br/>Investors will tell you the company is worth more.  And they may\nbe right.  But that doesn't mean it's wrong to sell.  Any financial\nadvisor who put all his client's assets in the stock of a single,\nprivate company would probably lose his license for it.<br/><br/>More and more, investors are letting founders cash out partially.\nThat should correct the problem. Most founders have such low standards\nthat they'll feel rich with a sum that doesn't seem huge to investors.\nBut this custom is spreading too slowly, because VCs are afraid of\nseeming irresponsible.  No one wants to be the first VC to give\nsomeone fuck-you money and then actually get told \"fuck you.\" But\nuntil this does start to happen, we know VCs are being too conservative.<br/><br/><b>19. Investors vary greatly.</b><br/><br/>Back when I was a founder I used to think all VCs were the same.\nAnd in fact they do all <a href=\"http://www.redpoint.com/team/\">look</a> \nthe same.  They're all what hackers\ncall \"suits.\"  But since I've been dealing with VCs more I've learned\nthat some suits are smarter than others.<br/><br/>They're also in a business where winners tend to keep winning and\nlosers to keep losing.  When a VC firm has been successful in the\npast, everyone wants funding from them, so they get the pick of all\nthe new deals.  The self-reinforcing nature of the venture funding\nmarket means that the top ten firms live in a completely different\nworld from, say, the hundredth.  As well as being smarter, they\ntend to be calmer and more upstanding; they don't need to do iffy\nthings to get an edge, and don't want to because they have more\nbrand to protect.<br/><br/>There are only two kinds of VCs you want to take money from, if you\nhave the luxury of choosing: the \"top tier\" VCs, meaning about the\ntop 20 or so firms, plus a few new ones that are not among the top\n20 only because they haven't been around long enough.<br/><br/>It's particularly important to raise money from a top firm if you're\na hacker, because they're more confident.  That means they're less\nlikely to stick you with a business guy as CEO, like VCs used to\ndo in the 90s.  If you seem smart and want to do it, they'll let\nyou run the company.<br/><br/><b>20. Investors don't realize how much it costs to raise money from\nthem.</b><br/><br/>Raising money is a huge time suck at just the point where startups\ncan least afford it. It's not unusual for it to take five or six\nmonths to close a funding round.  Six weeks is fast.  And raising\nmoney is not just something you can leave running as a background\nprocess.  When you're raising money, it's inevitably the main focus\nof the company.  Which means building the product isn't.<br/><br/>Suppose a Y Combinator company starts talking to VCs after demo\nday, and is successful in raising money from them, closing the deal\nafter a comparatively short 8 weeks.  Since demo day occurs after\n10 weeks, the company is now 18 weeks old.  Raising money, rather\nthan working on the product, has been the company's main focus for\n44% of its existence.  And mind you, this an example where things\nturned out <i>well</i>.<br/><br/>When a startup does return to working on the product after a funding\nround finally closes, it's as if they were returning to work after\na months-long illness.  They've lost most of their momentum.<br/><br/>Investors have no idea how much they damage the companies they\ninvest in by taking so long to do it.  But companies do. So there\nis a big opportunity here for a new kind of venture fund that invests\nsmaller amounts at lower valuations, but promises to either close\nor say no very quickly.  If there were such a firm, I'd recommend\nit to startups in preference to any other, no matter how prestigious.\nStartups live on speed and momentum.<br/><br/><b>21. Investors don't like to say no.</b><br/><br/>The reason funding deals take so long to close is mainly that\ninvestors can't make up their minds.  VCs are not big companies;\nthey can do a deal in 24 hours if they need to.  But they usually\nlet the initial meetings stretch out over a couple weeks.  The\nreason is the selection algorithm I mentioned earlier.  Most don't\ntry to predict whether a startup will win, but to notice quickly\nthat it already is winning.  They care what the market thinks of\nyou and what other VCs think of you, and they can't judge those\njust from meeting you.<br/><br/>Because they're investing in things that (a) change fast and (b)\nthey don't understand, a lot of investors will reject you in a way\nthat can later be claimed not to have been a rejection.  Unless you\nknow this world, you may not even realize you've been rejected.\nHere's a VC saying no:\n<blockquote>\n  We're really excited about your project, and we want to keep in\n  close touch as you develop it further.\n</blockquote>\nTranslated into more straightforward language, this means: We're\nnot investing in you, but we may change our minds if it looks like\nyou're taking off.  Sometimes they're more candid and say explicitly\nthat they need to \"see some traction.\"  They'll invest in you if\nyou start to get lots of users.  But so would any VC.  So all they're\nsaying is that you're still at square 1.<br/><br/>Here's a test for deciding whether a VC's response was yes or no.\nLook down at your hands.  Are you holding a termsheet?<br/><br/><b>22. You need investors.</b><br/><br/>Some founders say \"Who needs investors?\"  Empirically the answer\nseems to be: everyone who wants to succeed.  Practically every\nsuccessful startup takes outside investment at some point.<br/><br/>Why? What the people who think they don't need investors forget is\nthat they will have competitors.  The question is not whether you\n<i>need</i> outside investment, but whether it could help you at all.\nIf the answer is yes, and you don't take investment, then competitors\nwho do will have an advantage over you.  And in the startup world\na little advantage can expand into a lot.<br/><br/>Mike Moritz famously said that he invested in Yahoo because he\nthought they had a few weeks' lead over their competitors.  That\nmay not have mattered quite so much as he thought, because Google\ncame along three years later and kicked Yahoo's ass.  But there is\nsomething in what he said.  Sometimes a small lead can grow into\nthe yes half of a binary choice.<br/><br/>Maybe as it gets cheaper to start a startup, it will start to be\npossible to succeed in a competitive market without outside funding.  \nThere are certainly\ncosts to raising money.  But as of this writing the empirical\nevidence says it's a net win.<br/><br/><b>23. Investors like it when you don't need them.</b><br/><br/>A lot of founders approach investors as if they needed their\npermission to start a company—as if it were like getting into\ncollege.  But you don't need investors to start most companies;\nthey just make it easier.<br/><br/>And in fact, investors greatly prefer it if you don't need them.\nWhat excites them, both consciously and unconsciously, is the sort\nof startup that approaches them saying \"the train's leaving the\nstation; are you in or out?\" not the one saying \"please can we have\nsome money to start a company?\"<br/><br/>Most investors are \"bottoms\" in the sense that the startups they\nlike most are those that are rough with them.  When Google stuck\nKleiner and Sequoia with a $75 million premoney valuation, their\nreaction was probably \"Ouch! That feels so good.\" And they were\nright, weren't they?  That deal probably made them more than any\nother they've done.<br/><br/>The thing is, VCs are pretty good at reading people.  So don't try\nto act tough with them unless you really are the next Google, or\nthey'll see through you in a second.  Instead of acting tough, what\nmost startups should do is simply always have a backup plan.  Always\nhave some alternative plan for getting started if any given investor\nsays no.  Having one is the best insurance against needing one.<br/><br/>So you shouldn't start a startup that's expensive to start, because\nthen you'll be at the mercy of investors.  If you ultimately want\nto do something that will cost a lot, start by doing a cheaper\nsubset of it, and expand your ambitions when and if you raise more\nmoney.<br/><br/>Apparently the most likely animals to be left alive after a nuclear\nwar are cockroaches, because they're so hard to kill.  That's what\nyou want to be as a startup, initially.  Instead of a beautiful\nbut fragile flower that needs to have its stem in a plastic tube\nto support itself, better to be small, ugly, and indestructible.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nI may be underestimating VCs.
