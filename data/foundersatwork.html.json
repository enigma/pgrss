{"href":"foundersatwork.html","title":"Learning from Founders","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">January 2007<br/><br/><i>(Foreword to Jessica Livingston's \n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590597141\">Founders at Work</a>.)</i><br/><br/>Apparently sprinters reach their highest speed right out of the\nblocks, and spend the rest of the race slowing down.  The winners\nslow down the least.  It's that way with most startups too.  The\nearliest phase is usually the most productive.  That's when they\nhave the really big ideas.  Imagine what Apple was like when 100%\nof its employees were either Steve Jobs or Steve Wozniak.<br/><br/>The striking thing about this phase is that it's completely different\nfrom most people's idea of what business is like.  If you looked\nin people's heads (or stock photo collections) for images representing\n\"business,\" you'd get images of people dressed up in suits, groups\nsitting around conference tables looking serious, Powerpoint\npresentations, people producing thick reports for one another to\nread.   Early stage startups are the exact opposite of this.  And\nyet they're probably the most productive part of the whole economy.<br/><br/>Why the disconnect?  I think there's a general principle at work\nhere: the less energy people expend on performance, the more they\nexpend on appearances to compensate.  More often than not the energy\nthey expend on seeming impressive makes their actual performance\nworse.  A few years ago I read an article in which a car magazine\nmodified the \"sports\" model of some production car to get the fastest\npossible standing quarter mile.  You know how they did it?  They\ncut off all the crap the manufacturer had bolted onto the car to\nmake it <i>look</i> fast.<br/><br/>Business is broken the same way that car was.  The effort that goes\ninto looking productive is not merely wasted, but actually makes\norganizations less productive.  Suits, for example.  Suits do not\nhelp people to think better.  I bet most executives at big companies\ndo their best thinking when they wake up on Sunday morning and go\ndownstairs in their bathrobe to make a cup of coffee.  That's when\nyou have ideas.  Just imagine what a company would be like if people\ncould think that well at work.  People do in startups, at least\nsome of the time.  (Half the time you're in a panic because your\nservers are on fire, but the other half you're thinking as deeply\nas most people only get to sitting alone on a Sunday morning.)<br/><br/>Ditto for most of the other differences between startups and what\npasses for productivity in big companies.  And yet conventional\nideas of professionalism have such an iron grip on our minds that\neven startup founders are affected by them.  In our startup, when\noutsiders came to visit we tried hard to seem \"professional.\" We'd\nclean up our offices, wear better clothes, try to arrange that a\nlot of people were there during conventional office hours.  In fact,\nprogramming didn't get done by well-dressed people at clean desks\nduring office hours.  It got done by badly dressed people (I was\nnotorious for programmming wearing just a towel) in offices strewn\nwith junk at 2 in the morning.  But no visitor would understand\nthat.  Not even investors, who are supposed to be able to recognize\nreal productivity when they see it.  Even we were affected by the\nconventional wisdom.  We thought of ourselves as impostors, succeeding\ndespite being totally unprofessional.  It was as if we'd created a\nFormula 1 car but felt sheepish because it didn't look like a car\nwas supposed to look.<br/><br/>In the car world, there are at least some people who know that a\nhigh performance car looks like a Formula 1 racecar, not a sedan\nwith giant rims and a fake spoiler bolted to the trunk.  Why not\nin business?  Probably because startups are so small.  The really\ndramatic growth happens when a startup only has three or four people,\nso only three or four people see that, whereas tens of thousands\nsee business as it's practiced by Boeing or Philip Morris.<br/><br/>This book can help fix that problem, by showing everyone what, till\nnow, only a handful people got to see: what happens in the first\nyear of a startup.  This is what real productivity looks like. This\nis the Formula 1 racecar.  It looks weird, but it goes fast.<br/><br/>Of course, big companies won't be able to do everything these\nstartups do.  In big companies there's always going to be more\npolitics, and less scope for individual decisions.  But seeing what\nstartups are really like will at least show other organizations\nwhat to aim for.  The time may soon be coming when instead of\nstartups trying to seem more corporate, corporations will try to\nseem more like startups.  That would be a good thing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.aoky.net/articles/paul_graham/foundersatwork.htm\">Japanese\nTranslation</a>\n<br/><br/><hr color=\"#cccccc\" height=\"50\"/><br/><br/></font>","date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
