{"href":"ycombinator.html","title":"A New Venture Animal","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">March 2008, rev May 2013<br/><br/><i>(This essay grew out of something I wrote for myself to figure\nout what we do.  Even though Y Combinator is now 3 years old, we're still\ntrying to understand its implications.)</i><br/><br/>\nI was annoyed recently to read a description of Y Combinator that\nsaid \"Y Combinator does seed funding for startups.\"  What was\nespecially annoying about it was that I wrote it.  This doesn't\nreally convey what we do.  And the reason it's inaccurate is that,\nparadoxically, funding very early stage startups is not mainly about\nfunding.<br/><br/>Saying YC does seed funding for startups is a description in terms\nof earlier models.  It's like calling a car a horseless carriage.<br/><br/>When you scale animals you can't just keep everything in proportion.\nFor example, volume grows as the cube of linear dimension, but\nsurface area only as the square.  So as animals get bigger they\nhave trouble radiating heat.  That's why mice and rabbits are furry\nand elephants and hippos aren't.  You can't make a mouse by scaling\ndown an elephant.<br/><br/>YC represents a new, smaller kind of animal—so much smaller\nthat all the rules are different.<br/><br/>Before us, most companies in the startup funding business were\nventure capital funds.  VCs generally fund later stage companies\nthan we do.  And they supply so much money that, even though the\nother things they do may be very valuable, it's not that inaccurate\nto regard VCs as sources of money.  Good VCs are \"smart money,\" but\nthey're still money.<br/><br/>All good investors supply a combination of money and help.  But\nthese scale differently, just as volume and surface area do.  Late\nstage investors supply huge amounts of money and\ncomparatively little help: when a company about to go public gets\na mezzanine round of $50 million, the deal tends to be almost\nentirely about money.  As you move earlier in the venture\nfunding process, the ratio of help to money increases, because\nearlier stage companies have different needs.  Early stage companies\nneed less money because they're smaller and cheaper to run, but\nthey need more help because life is so precarious for them.  So\nwhen VCs do a series A round for, say, $2 million, they generally\nexpect to offer a significant amount of help along with the money.<br/><br/>Y Combinator occupies the earliest end of the spectrum.  We're at\nleast one and generally two steps before VC funding.  (Though some\nstartups go straight from YC to VC, the most common trajectory is\nto do an angel round first.)  And what happens at Y Combinator is\nas different from what happens in a series A round as a series A\nround is from a mezzanine financing.<br/><br/>At our end, money is almost a negligible factor.  The startup usually\nconsists of just the founders. Their living expenses are the\ncompany's main expense, and since most founders are under 30, their\nliving expenses are low.  But at this early stage companies need a\nlot of help.  Practically every question is still unanswered.  Some\ncompanies we've funded have been working on their software for a\nyear or more, but others haven't decided what to work on, or even\nwho the founders should be.<br/><br/>When PR people and journalists recount the histories of startups\nafter they've become big, they always underestimate how uncertain\nthings were at first.  They're not being deliberately misleading.\nWhen you look at a company like Google, it's hard to imagine they\ncould once have been small and helpless.  Sure, at one point they\nwere a just a couple guys in a garage—but even then their\ngreatness was assured, and all they had to do was roll forward along\nthe railroad tracks of destiny.<br/><br/>Far from it.  A lot of startups with just as promising beginnings\nend up failing.  Google has such momentum now that it would be hard\nfor anyone to stop them.  But all it would have taken in the beginning\nwould have been for two Google employees to focus on the wrong\nthings for six months, and the company could have died.<br/><br/>We know, because we've been there, just how vulnerable startups are\nin the earliest phases.  Curiously enough, that's why founders tend\nto get so rich from them.  Reward is always proportionate to risk,\nand very early stage startups are insanely risky.<br/><br/>What we really do at Y Combinator is get startups launched straight.\nOne of many metaphors you could use for YC is a steam catapult on\nan aircraft carrier.  We get startups airborne.  Barely airborne,\nbut enough that they can accelerate fast.<br/><br/>When you're launching planes they have to be set up properly or\nyou're just launching projectiles.  They have to be pointed straight\ndown the deck; the wings have to be trimmed properly; the engines\nhave to be at full power; the pilot has to be ready.  These are the\nkind of problems we deal with.  After we fund startups we work\nclosely with them for three months—so closely in fact that\nwe insist they move to where we are.  And what we do in those three\nmonths is make sure everything is set up for launch.  If there are\ntensions between cofounders we help sort them out.  We get all the\npaperwork set up properly so there are no nasty surprises later.\nIf the founders aren't sure what to focus on first, we try to figure\nthat out.  If there is some obstacle right in front of them, we\neither try to remove it, or shift the startup sideways.  The goal\nis to get every distraction out of the way so the founders can use\nthat time to build (or finish building) something impressive.  And\nthen near the end of the three months we push the button on the\nsteam catapult in the form of Demo Day, where the current group of\nstartups present to pretty much every investor in Silicon Valley.<br/><br/>Launching companies isn't identical with launching products.  Though\nwe do spend a lot of time on launch strategies for products, there\nare some things that take too long to build for a startup to launch\nthem before raising their next round of funding.  Several of the\nmost promising startups we've funded haven't launched their products\nyet, but are definitely launched as companies.<br/><br/>In the earliest stage, startups not only have more questions to\nanswer, but they tend to be different kinds of questions.  In later\nstage startups the questions are about deals, or hiring, or\norganization.  In the earliest phase they tend to be about technology\nand design.  What do you make?  That's the first problem to solve.\nThat's why our motto is \"Make something people want.\"  This is\nalways a good thing for companies to do, but it's even more important\nearly on, because it sets the bounds for every other question.  Who\nyou hire, how much money you raise, how you market yourself—they\nall depend on what you're making.<br/><br/>Because the early problems are so much about technology and design,\nyou probably need to be hackers to do what we do.  While some VCs\nhave technical backgrounds, I don't know any who still write code.\nTheir expertise is mostly in business—as it should be, because\nthat's the kind of expertise you need in the phase between series\nA and (if you're lucky) IPO.<br/><br/>We're so different from VCs that we're really a different kind of\nanimal.  Can we claim founders are better off as a result of this\nnew type of venture firm?  I'm pretty sure the answer is yes, because\nYC is an improved version of what happened to our startup, and our\ncase was not atypical.  We started Viaweb with $10,000 in seed money\nfrom our friend Julian.  He was a lawyer and arranged all our\npaperwork, so we could just code.  We spent three months building\na version 1, which we then presented to investors to raise more\nmoney.  Sounds familiar, doesn't it?  But YC improves on that\nsignificantly.  Julian knew a lot about law and business, but his\nadvice ended there; he was not a startup guy.  So we made some basic\nmistakes early on.  And when we presented to investors, we presented\nto only 2, because that was all we knew.  If we'd had our later\nselves to encourage and advise us, and Demo Day to present at, we\nwould have been in much better shape.  We probably could have raised\nmoney at 3 to 5 times the valuation we did.<br/><br/>If we take 7% of a company we fund, the founders only have to do\n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/equity.html\">7.5%</a> better in their next round of funding\nto end up net ahead.  We certainly manage that.<br/><br/>So who is our 7% coming out of?  If the founders end up net ahead\nit's not coming out of them.  So is it coming out of later stage\ninvestors?  Well, they do end up paying more.  But I think they pay\nmore because the company is actually more valuable.  And later stage\ninvestors have no problem with that.  The returns of a VC fund\ndepend on the quality of the companies they invest in, not how\ncheaply they can buy stock in them.<br/><br/>If what we do is useful, why wasn't anyone doing it before?  There\nare two answers to that.  One is that people were doing it before,\njust haphazardly on a smaller scale.  Before us, seed funding came\nprimarily from individual angel investors.  Larry and Sergey, for\nexample, got their seed funding from Andy Bechtolsheim, one of the\nfounders of Sun.  And because he was a startup guy he probably gave\nthem useful advice.  But raising money from angel investors is a\nhit or miss thing.  It's a sideline for most of them, so they only\ndo a handful of deals a year and they don't spend a lot of time on\nthe startups they invest in.  And they're hard to reach, because\nthey don't want random startups pestering them with business plans.\nThe Google guys were lucky because they knew someone who knew\nBechtolsheim.  It generally takes a personal introduction with\nangels.<br/><br/>The other reason no one was doing quite what we do is that till\nrecently it was a lot more expensive to start a startup.  You'll\nnotice we haven't funded any biotech startups.  That's still\nexpensive.  But advancing technology has made web startups so cheap\nthat you really can get a company airborne for $15,000.  If you\nunderstand how to operate a steam catapult, at least.<br/><br/>So in effect what's happened is that a new ecological niche has\nopened up, and Y Combinator is the new kind of animal that has moved\ninto it.  We're not a replacement for venture capital funds.  We\noccupy a new, adjacent niche.  And conditions in our niche are\nreally quite different.  It's not just that the problems we face\nare different; the whole structure of the business is different.\nVCs are playing a zero-sum game.  They're all competing for a slice\nof a fixed amount of \"deal flow,\" and that explains a lot of their\nbehavior.  Whereas our m.o. is to create new deal flow, by encouraging\nhackers who would have gotten jobs to start their own startups\ninstead.  We compete more with employers than VCs.<br/><br/>It's not surprising something like this would happen.  Most fields\nbecome more specialized—more articulated—as they develop,\nand startups are certainly an area in which there has been a lot\nof development over the past couple decades.  The venture business\nin its present form is only about forty years old.  It stands to\nreason it would evolve.<br/><br/>And it's natural that the new niche would at first be described,\neven by its inhabitants, in terms of the old one.  But really Y\nCombinator is not in the startup funding business.  Really we're\nmore of a small, furry steam catapult.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris\nfor reading drafts of this.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://ycombinator.com/images/y18.gif\"/>\n<a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=133430\">Comment</a> on this essay.<br/><br/><br clear=\"all\"/></font>","date":"2008-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
