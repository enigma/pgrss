{"href":"vw.html","title":"Snapshot: Viaweb, June 1998","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">January 2012<br/><br/>A few hours before the Yahoo acquisition was announced in June 1998\nI took a <a href=\"http://ycombinator.com/viaweb\">snapshot of Viaweb's\nsite</a>.  I thought it might be interesting to look at one day.<br/><br/>The first thing one notices is is how tiny the pages are.  Screens\nwere a lot smaller in 1998.  If I remember correctly, our frontpage\nused to just fit in the size window people typically used then.<br/><br/>Browsers then (IE 6 was still 3 years in the future) had few fonts\nand they weren't antialiased.  If you wanted to make pages that\nlooked good, you had to render display text as images.<br/><br/>You may notice a certain similarity between the Viaweb and <a href=\"http://ycombinator.com\">Y Combinator</a> logos.  We did that\nas an inside joke when we started YC.  Considering how basic a red\ncircle is, it seemed surprising to me when we started Viaweb how\nfew other companies used one as their logo.  A bit later I realized\n<a href=\"zero.html\">why</a>.<br/><br/>On the <a href=\"http://www.ycombinator.com/viaweb/com.html\">Company\npage</a> you'll notice a mysterious individual called John McArtyem.\nRobert Morris (aka Rtm) was so publicity averse after the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_worm\">Worm</a> that he\ndidn't want his name on the site.  I managed to get him to agree\nto a compromise: we could use his bio but not his name.  He has\nsince <a href=\"http://ycombinator.com/people.html\">relaxed</a> a bit\non that point.<br/><br/>Trevor graduated at about the same time the acquisition closed, so in the\ncourse of 4 days he went from impecunious grad student to millionaire\nPhD.  The culmination of my career as a writer of press releases\nwas one <a href=\"http://ycombinator.com/viaweb/trevor.html\">celebrating\nhis graduation</a>, illustrated with a drawing I did of him during\na meeting.<br/><br/>(Trevor also appears as <a href=\"http://ycombinator.com/viaweb/tlbwebdesign.html\">Trevino\nBagwell</a> in our directory of web designers merchants could hire\nto build stores for them.  We inserted him as a ringer in case some\ncompetitor tried to spam our web designers.   We assumed his logo\nwould deter any actual customers, but it did not.)<br/><br/>Back in the 90s, to get users you had to get mentioned in magazines\nand newspapers.  There were not the same ways to get found online\nthat there are today.  So we used to pay a <a href=\"submarine.html\">PR\nfirm</a> $16,000 a month to get us mentioned in the press.  Fortunately\nreporters <a href=\"http://ycombinator.com/viaweb/presquot.html\">liked\nus</a>.<br/><br/>In our <a href=\"http://ycombinator.com/viaweb/se.html\">advice about\ngetting traffic from search engines</a> (I don't think the term SEO\nhad been coined yet), we say there are only 7 that matter: Yahoo,\nAltaVista, Excite, WebCrawler, InfoSeek, Lycos, and HotBot.  Notice\nanything missing?  Google was incorporated that September.<br/><br/>We supported online transactions via a company called \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CyberCash,_Inc.\">Cybercash</a>,\nsince if we lacked that feature we'd have gotten beaten up in product\ncomparisons.  But Cybercash was so bad and most stores' order volumes\nwere so low that it was better if merchants processed orders like phone orders.  We had a page in our site trying to <a href=\"http://www.ycombinator.com/viaweb/cybercash.html\">talk merchants\nout of doing real time authorizations</a>.<br/><br/>The whole site was organized like a funnel, directing people to the\n<a href=\"http://ycombinator.com/viaweb/tesdriv.html\">test drive</a>.\nIt was a novel thing to be able to try out software online.  We put\ncgi-bin in our dynamic urls to fool competitors about how our\nsoftware worked.<br/><br/>We had some <a href=\"http://ycombinator.com/viaweb/us.html\">well\nknown users</a>.  Needless to say, Frederick's of Hollywood got the\nmost traffic.  We charged a flat fee of $300/month for big stores,\nso it was a little alarming to have users who got lots of traffic.\nI once calculated how much Frederick's was costing us in bandwidth,\nand it was about $300/month.<br/><br/>Since we hosted all the stores, which together were getting just\nover 10 million page views per month in June 1998, we consumed what\nat the time seemed a lot of bandwidth.  We had 2 T1s (3 Mb/sec)\ncoming into our offices.  In those days there was no AWS.  Even\ncolocating servers seemed too risky, considering how often things\nwent wrong with them.  So we had our servers in our offices.  Or\nmore precisely, in Trevor's office.  In return for the unique\nprivilege of sharing his office with no other humans, he had to\nshare it with 6 shrieking tower servers.  His office was nicknamed\nthe Hot Tub on account of the heat they generated.  Most days his\nstack of window air conditioners could keep up.<br/><br/>For describing pages, we had a template language called <a href=\"http://ycombinator.com/viaweb/rtml.html\">RTML</a>, which\nsupposedly stood for something, but which in fact I named after\nRtm.  RTML was Common Lisp augmented by some macros and libraries,\nand concealed under a structure editor that made it look like it\nhad syntax.<br/><br/>Since we did continuous releases, our software didn't actually have\nversions.  But in those days the trade press expected versions, so\nwe made them up.  If we wanted to get lots of attention, we made\nthe version number <a href=\"http://www.ycombinator.com/viaweb/rel4.html\">an\ninteger</a>.  That \"version 4.0\" icon was generated by our own\nbutton generator, incidentally.  The whole Viaweb site was made\nwith our software, even though it wasn't an online store, because\nwe wanted to experience what our users did.<br/><br/>At the end of 1997, we released a general purpose shopping search\nengine called <a href=\"http://ycombinator.com/viaweb/shoprel.html\">Shopfind</a>.  It\nwas pretty advanced for the time.  It had a programmable crawler\nthat could crawl most of the different stores online and pick out\nthe products.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
