{"href":"writing44.html","title":"Writing,  Briefly","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">March 2005<br/><br/><!--<i>(Informal surveys of referring urls suggested demand for\nessays that were short and didn't mention Lisp.)</i>\n-->\n<i>(In the process\nof answering an email, I accidentally wrote a tiny essay about writing.\nI usually spend weeks on an essay.  This one took <!--44--> 67 minutesâ€”23\nof writing, and <!--21--> 44 of rewriting.)</i><br/><br/>I think it's far more important to write well than most people\nrealize.  Writing doesn't just communicate ideas; it generates them.\nIf you're bad at writing and don't like to do it, you'll miss out\non most of the ideas writing would have generated.<br/><br/>As for how to write well, here's the short version: \nWrite a bad version\n1 as fast as you can; rewrite it over and over; cut <s>out</s> everything\nunnecessary; write in a conversational tone; develop a nose for\nbad writing, so you can see and fix it in yours; imitate writers\nyou like; if you can't get started, tell someone what you plan to\nwrite about, then write down what you said; expect\n80% of the ideas in an essay to happen after you start writing it,\nand 50% of those you start with to be wrong; be confident enough\nto cut; have friends you trust read your stuff and tell you which\nbits are confusing or drag; don't (always) make detailed outlines;\nmull ideas over for a few days before\nwriting; carry a small notebook or scrap paper with you; start writing \nwhen you think of the first \nsentence; if a deadline\nforces you to start before that, just say the most important sentence\nfirst; write about stuff you like; don't try to sound impressive; don't hesitate to change the topic on the fly;\nuse footnotes to contain digressions; use anaphora to knit\nsentences together; read your essays out loud to see (a) where you stumble\nover awkward phrases and (b) which bits are boring (the\nparagraphs you dread reading); try to tell the\nreader something new and useful; work in fairly big quanta of time;\nwhen you restart, begin by rereading what you have so far; when you\nfinish, leave yourself something easy to start with; accumulate\nnotes for topics you plan to cover at the bottom of the file; don't\nfeel obliged to cover any of them; write for a reader who won't\nread the essay as carefully as you do, just as pop songs are\ndesigned to sound ok on crappy car radios; <!-- read\nwriters you like, and try to figure out what makes you like them;-->\nif you say anything mistaken, fix it immediately;\nask friends which sentence you'll regret most; go back and tone\ndown harsh remarks; publish stuff online, because\nan audience makes you write more, and thus generate more\nideas; print out drafts instead of just looking at them\non the screen; use simple, germanic words; learn to distinguish\nsurprises from digressions; learn to recognize the approach of an\nending, and when one appears, grab it.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2005-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
