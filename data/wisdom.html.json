{"href":"wisdom.html","title":"Is It Worth Being Wise?","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">February 2007<br/><br/>A few days ago I finally figured out something I've wondered about\nfor 25 years: the relationship between wisdom and intelligence.\nAnyone can see they're not the same by the number of people who are\nsmart, but not very wise.  And yet intelligence and wisdom do seem\nrelated.  How?<br/><br/>What is wisdom?  I'd say it's knowing what to do in a lot of\nsituations.  I'm not trying to make a deep point here about the\ntrue nature of wisdom, just to figure out how we use the word.  A\nwise person is someone who usually knows the right thing to do.<br/><br/>And yet isn't being smart also knowing what to do in certain\nsituations?  For example, knowing what to do when the teacher tells\nyour elementary school class to add all the numbers from 1 to 100?\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f1n\"><font color=\"#777777\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Some say wisdom and intelligence apply to different types of\nproblems—wisdom to human problems and intelligence to abstract\nones.  But that isn't true.  Some wisdom has nothing to do with\npeople: for example, the wisdom of the engineer who knows certain\nstructures are less prone to failure than others.  And certainly\nsmart people can find clever solutions to human problems as well\nas abstract ones. \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f2n\"><font color=\"#777777\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Another popular explanation is that wisdom comes from experience\nwhile intelligence is innate.  But people are not simply wise in\nproportion to how much experience they have.  Other things must\ncontribute to wisdom besides experience, and some may be innate: a\nreflective disposition, for example.<br/><br/>Neither of the conventional explanations of the difference between\nwisdom and intelligence stands up to scrutiny.  So what is the\ndifference?  If we look at how people use the words \"wise\" and\n\"smart,\" what they seem to mean is different shapes of performance.<br/><br/><b>Curve</b><br/><br/>\"Wise\" and \"smart\" are both ways of saying someone knows what to\ndo.  The difference is that \"wise\" means one has a high average\noutcome across all situations, and \"smart\" means one does spectacularly\nwell in a few.  That is, if you had a graph in which the x axis\nrepresented situations and the y axis the outcome, the graph of the\nwise person would be high overall, and the graph of the smart person\nwould have high peaks.<br/><br/>The distinction is similar to the rule that one should judge talent\nat its best and character at its worst.  Except you judge intelligence\nat its best, and wisdom by its average.  That's how the two are\nrelated: they're the two different senses in which the same curve\ncan be high.<br/><br/>So a wise person knows what to do in most situations, while a smart\nperson knows what to do in situations where few others could.  We\nneed to add one more qualification: we should ignore cases where\nsomeone knows what to do because they have inside information. \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f3n\"><font color=\"#777777\">3</font></a>]</font>\nBut aside from that, I don't think we can get much more specific\nwithout starting to be mistaken.<br/><br/>Nor do we need to.  Simple as it is, this explanation predicts, or\nat least accords with, both of the conventional stories about the\ndistinction between wisdom and intelligence.  Human problems are\nthe most common type, so being good at solving those is key in\nachieving a high average outcome.   And it seems natural that a\nhigh average outcome depends mostly on experience, but that dramatic\npeaks can only be achieved by people with certain rare, innate\nqualities; nearly anyone can learn to be a good swimmer, but to be\nan Olympic swimmer you need a certain body type.<br/><br/>This explanation also suggests why wisdom is such an elusive concept:\nthere's no such thing.  \"Wise\" means something—that one is\non average good at making the right choice.  But giving the name\n\"wisdom\" to the supposed quality that enables one to do that doesn't\nmean such a thing exists.  To the extent \"wisdom\" means anything,\nit refers to a grab-bag of qualities as various as self-discipline,\nexperience, and empathy.  \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f4n\"><font color=\"#777777\">4</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Likewise, though \"intelligent\" means something, we're asking for\ntrouble if we insist on looking for a single thing called \"intelligence.\"\nAnd whatever its components, they're not all innate.  We use the\nword \"intelligent\" as an indication of ability: a smart person can\ngrasp things few others could.  It does seem likely there's some\ninborn predisposition to intelligence (and wisdom too), but this\npredisposition is not itself intelligence.<br/><br/>One reason we tend to think of intelligence as inborn is that people\ntrying to measure it have concentrated on the aspects of it that\nare most measurable.  A quality that's inborn will obviously be\nmore convenient to work with than one that's influenced by experience,\nand thus might vary in the course of a study.  The problem comes\nwhen we drag the word \"intelligence\" over onto what they're measuring.\nIf they're measuring something inborn, they can't be measuring\nintelligence.  Three year olds aren't smart.   When we describe one\nas smart, it's shorthand for \"smarter than other three year olds.\"<br/><br/><b>Split</b><br/><br/>Perhaps it's a technicality to point out that a predisposition to\nintelligence is not the same as intelligence.  But it's an important\ntechnicality, because it reminds us that we can become smarter,\njust as we can become wiser.<br/><br/>The alarming thing is that we may have to choose between the two.<br/><br/>If wisdom and intelligence are the average and peaks of the same\ncurve, then they converge as the number of points on the curve\ndecreases.  If there's just one point, they're identical: the average\nand maximum are the same.  But as the number of points increases,\nwisdom and intelligence diverge.  And historically the number of\npoints on the curve seems to have been increasing: our ability is\ntested in an ever wider range of situations.<br/><br/>In the time of Confucius and Socrates, people seem to have regarded\nwisdom, learning, and intelligence as more closely related than we\ndo.  Distinguishing between \"wise\" and \"smart\" is a modern habit.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f5n\"><font color=\"#777777\">5</font></a>]</font>\nAnd the reason we do is that they've been diverging.  As knowledge\ngets more specialized, there are more points on the curve, and the\ndistinction between the spikes and the average becomes sharper,\nlike a digital image rendered with more pixels.<br/><br/>One consequence is that some old recipes may have become obsolete.\nAt the very least we have to go back and figure out if they were\nreally recipes for wisdom or intelligence.  But the really striking\nchange, as intelligence and wisdom drift apart, is that we may have\nto decide which we prefer.  We may not be able to optimize for both\nsimultaneously.<br/><br/>Society seems to have voted for intelligence.  We no longer admire\nthe sage—not the way people did two thousand years ago.  Now\nwe admire the genius.  Because in fact the distinction we began\nwith has a rather brutal converse: just as you can be smart without\nbeing very wise, you can be wise without being very smart.  That\ndoesn't sound especially admirable.  That gets you James Bond, who\nknows what to do in a lot of situations, but has to rely on Q for\nthe ones involving math.<br/><br/>Intelligence and wisdom are obviously not mutually exclusive.  In\nfact, a high average may help support high peaks.  But there are\nreasons to believe that at some point you have to choose between\nthem.  One is the example of very smart people, who are so often\nunwise that in popular culture this now seems to be regarded as the\nrule rather than the exception.  Perhaps the absent-minded professor\nis wise in his way, or wiser than he seems, but he's not wise in\nthe way Confucius or Socrates wanted people to be. \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f6n\"><font color=\"#777777\">6</font></a>]</font><br/><br/><b>New</b><br/><br/>For both Confucius and Socrates, wisdom, virtue, and happiness were\nnecessarily related.  The wise man was someone who knew what the\nright choice was and always made it; to be the right choice, it had\nto be morally right; he was therefore always happy, knowing he'd\ndone the best he could.  I can't think of many ancient philosophers\nwho would have disagreed with that, so far as it goes.<br/><br/>\"The superior man is always happy; the small man sad,\" said Confucius.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f7n\"><font color=\"#777777\">7</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Whereas a few years ago I read an interview with a mathematician\nwho said that most nights he went to bed discontented, feeling he\nhadn't made enough progress.  \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f8n\"><font color=\"#777777\">8</font></a>]</font>\nThe Chinese and Greek words we\ntranslate as \"happy\" didn't mean exactly what we do by it, but\nthere's enough overlap that this remark contradicts them.<br/><br/>Is the mathematician a small man because he's discontented?  No;\nhe's just doing a kind of work that wasn't very common in Confucius's\nday.<br/><br/>Human knowledge seems to grow fractally.  Time after time, something\nthat seemed a small and uninteresting area—experimental error,\neven—turns out, when examined up close, to have as much in\nit as all knowledge up to that point.  Several of the fractal buds\nthat have exploded since ancient times involve inventing and\ndiscovering new things.  Math, for example, used to be something a\nhandful of people did part-time.  Now it's the career of thousands.\nAnd in work that involves making new things, some old rules don't\napply.<br/><br/>Recently I've spent some time advising people, and there I find the\nancient rule still works: try to understand the situation as well\nas you can, give the best advice you can based on your experience,\nand then don't worry about it, knowing you did all you could.  But\nI don't have anything like this serenity when I'm writing an essay.\nThen I'm worried.  What if I run out of ideas?  And when I'm writing,\nfour nights out of five I go to bed discontented, feeling I didn't\nget enough done.<br/><br/>Advising people and writing are fundamentally different types of\nwork.  When people come to you with a problem and you have to figure\nout the right thing to do, you don't (usually) have to invent\nanything.  You just weigh the alternatives and try to judge which\nis the prudent choice.  But <i>prudence</i> can't tell me what sentence\nto write next.  The search space is too big.<br/><br/>Someone like a judge or a military officer can in much of his work\nbe guided by duty, but duty is no guide in making things.  Makers\ndepend on something more precarious: inspiration.  And like most\npeople who lead a precarious existence, they tend to be worried,\nnot contented.  In that respect they're more like the small man of\nConfucius's day, always one bad harvest (or ruler) away from\nstarvation. Except instead of being at the mercy of weather and\nofficials, they're at the mercy of their own imagination.<br/><br/><b>Limits</b><br/><br/>To me it was a relief just to realize it might be ok to be discontented.\nThe idea that a successful person should be happy has thousands of\nyears of momentum behind it.  If I was any good, why didn't I have\nthe easy confidence winners are supposed to have?  But that, I now\nbelieve, is like a runner asking \"If I'm such a good athlete, why\ndo I feel so tired?\" Good runners still get tired; they just get\ntired at higher speeds.<br/><br/>People whose work is to invent or discover things are in the same\nposition as the runner.  There's no way for them to do the best\nthey can, because there's no limit to what they could do.  The\nclosest you can come is to compare yourself to other people.  But\nthe better you do, the less this matters.  An undergrad who gets\nsomething published feels like a star.  But for someone at the top\nof the field, what's the test of doing well?  Runners can at least\ncompare themselves to others doing exactly the same thing; if you\nwin an Olympic gold medal, you can be fairly content, even if you\nthink you could have run a bit faster.  But what is a novelist to\ndo?<br/><br/>Whereas if you're doing the kind of work in which problems are\npresented to you and you have to choose between several alternatives,\nthere's an upper bound on your performance: choosing the best every\ntime.  In ancient societies, nearly all work seems to have been of\nthis type.  The peasant had to decide whether a garment was worth\nmending, and the king whether or not to invade his neighbor, but\nneither was expected to invent anything.  In principle they could\nhave; the king could have invented firearms, then invaded his\nneighbor.  But in practice innovations were so rare that they weren't\nexpected of you, any more than goalkeepers are expected to score\ngoals. \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f9n\"><font color=\"#777777\">9</font></a>]</font>\nIn practice, it seemed as if there was a correct decision\nin every situation, and if you made it you'd done your job perfectly,\njust as a goalkeeper who prevents the other team from scoring is\nconsidered to have played a perfect game.<br/><br/>In this world, wisdom seemed paramount.  \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f10n\"><font color=\"#777777\">10</font></a>]</font>\nEven now, most people\ndo work in which problems are put before them and they have to\nchoose the best alternative.  But as knowledge has grown more\nspecialized, there are more and more types of work in which people\nhave to make up new things, and in which performance is therefore\nunbounded.  Intelligence has become increasingly important relative\nto wisdom because there is more room for spikes.<br/><br/><b>Recipes</b><br/><br/>Another sign we may have to choose between intelligence and wisdom\nis how different their recipes are.  Wisdom seems to come largely\nfrom curing childish qualities, and intelligence largely from\ncultivating them.<br/><br/>Recipes for wisdom, particularly ancient ones, tend to have a\nremedial character.  To achieve wisdom one must cut away all the\ndebris that fills one's head on emergence from childhood, leaving\nonly the important stuff.  Both self-control and experience have\nthis effect: to eliminate the random biases that come from your own\nnature and from the circumstances of your upbringing respectively.\nThat's not all wisdom is, but it's a large part of it.  Much of\nwhat's in the sage's head is also in the head of every twelve year\nold.  The difference is that in the head of the twelve year old\nit's mixed together with a lot of random junk.<br/><br/>The path to intelligence seems to be through working on hard problems.\nYou develop intelligence as you might develop muscles, through\nexercise.  But there can't be too much compulsion here.  No amount\nof discipline can replace genuine curiosity.  So cultivating\nintelligence seems to be a matter of identifying some bias in one's\ncharacter—some tendency to be interested in certain types of\nthings—and nurturing it.  Instead of obliterating your\nidiosyncrasies in an effort to make yourself a neutral vessel for\nthe truth, you select one and try to grow it from a seedling into\na tree.<br/><br/>The wise are all much alike in their wisdom, but very smart people\ntend to be smart in distinctive ways.<br/><br/>Most of our educational traditions aim at wisdom. So perhaps one\nreason schools work badly is that they're trying to make intelligence\nusing recipes for wisdom.  Most recipes for wisdom have an element\nof subjection.  At the very least, you're supposed to do what the\nteacher says.  The more extreme recipes aim to break down your\nindividuality the way basic training does.  But that's not the route\nto intelligence.  Whereas wisdom comes through humility, it may\nactually help, in cultivating intelligence, to have a mistakenly\nhigh opinion of your abilities, because that encourages you to keep\nworking.  Ideally till you realize how mistaken you were.<br/><br/>(The reason it's hard to learn new skills late in life is not just\nthat one's brain is less malleable.  Another probably even worse\nobstacle is that one has higher standards.)<br/><br/>I realize we're on dangerous ground here.  I'm not proposing the\nprimary goal of education should be to increase students' \"self-esteem.\"\nThat just breeds laziness.  And in any case, it doesn't really fool\nthe kids, not the smart ones.  They can tell at a young age that a\ncontest where everyone wins is a fraud.<br/><br/>A teacher has to walk a narrow path: you want to encourage kids to\ncome up with things on their own, but you can't simply applaud\neverything they produce.  You have to be a good audience: appreciative,\nbut not too easily impressed.  And that's a lot of work.  You have\nto have a good enough grasp of kids' capacities at different ages\nto know when to be surprised.<br/><br/>That's the opposite of traditional recipes for education.  Traditionally\nthe student is the audience, not the teacher; the student's job is\nnot to invent, but to absorb some prescribed body of material.  (The\nuse of the term \"recitation\" for sections in some colleges is a\nfossil of this.) The problem with these old traditions is that\nthey're too much influenced by recipes for wisdom.<br/><br/><b>Different</b><br/><br/>I deliberately gave this essay a provocative title; of course it's\nworth being wise.  But I think it's important to understand the\nrelationship between intelligence and wisdom, and particularly what\nseems to be the growing gap between them.  That way we can avoid\napplying rules and standards to intelligence that are really meant\nfor wisdom.  These two senses of \"knowing what to do\" are more\ndifferent than most people realize.  The path to wisdom is through\ndiscipline, and the path to intelligence through carefully selected\nself-indulgence.  Wisdom is universal, and intelligence idiosyncratic.\nAnd while wisdom yields calmness, intelligence much of the time\nleads to discontentment.<br/><br/>That's particularly worth remembering.  A physicist friend recently\ntold me half his department was on Prozac.  Perhaps if we acknowledge\nthat some amount of frustration is inevitable in certain kinds\nof work, we can mitigate its effects.  Perhaps we can box it up and\nput it away some of the time, instead of letting it flow together\nwith everyday sadness to produce what seems an alarmingly large\npool.  At the very least, we can avoid being discontented about\nbeing discontented.<br/><br/>If you feel exhausted, it's not necessarily because there's something\nwrong with you.  Maybe you're just running fast.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nGauss was supposedly asked this when he was 10.  Instead of\nlaboriously adding together the numbers like the other students,\nhe saw that they consisted of 50 pairs that each summed to 101 (100\n+ 1, 99 + 2, etc), and that he could just multiply 101 by 50 to get\nthe answer, 5050.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nA variant is that intelligence is the ability to solve problems,\nand wisdom the judgement to know how to use those solutions.   But\nwhile this is certainly an important relationship between wisdom\nand intelligence, it's not the <i>distinction between</i> them.  Wisdom\nis useful in solving problems too, and intelligence can help in\ndeciding what to do with the solutions.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nIn judging both intelligence and wisdom we have to factor out\nsome knowledge. People who know the combination of a safe will be\nbetter at opening it than people who don't, but no one would say\nthat was a test of intelligence or wisdom.<br/><br/>But knowledge overlaps with wisdom and probably also intelligence.\nA knowledge of human nature is certainly part of wisdom.  So where\ndo we draw the line?<br/><br/>Perhaps the solution is to discount knowledge that at some point\nhas a sharp drop in utility.  For example, understanding French\nwill help you in a large number of situations, but its value drops\nsharply as soon as no one else involved knows French.  Whereas the\nvalue of understanding vanity would decline more gradually.<br/><br/>The knowledge whose utility drops sharply is the kind that has\nlittle relation to other knowledge.  This includes mere conventions,\nlike languages and safe combinations, and also what we'd call\n\"random\" facts, like movie stars' birthdays, or how to distinguish\n1956 from 1957 Studebakers.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f4n\"><font color=\"#000000\">4</font></a>]\nPeople seeking some single thing called \"wisdom\" have been\nfooled by grammar.  Wisdom is just knowing the right thing to do,\nand there are a hundred and one different qualities that help in\nthat.  Some, like selflessness, might come from meditating in an\nempty room, and others, like a knowledge of human nature, might\ncome from going to drunken parties.<br/><br/>Perhaps realizing this will help dispel the cloud of semi-sacred\nmystery that surrounds wisdom in so many people's eyes.  The mystery\ncomes mostly from looking for something that doesn't exist.  And\nthe reason there have historically been so many different schools\nof thought about how to achieve wisdom is that they've focused on\ndifferent components of it.<br/><br/>When I use the word \"wisdom\" in this essay, I mean no more than\nwhatever collection of qualities helps people make the right choice\nin a wide variety of situations.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f5n\"><font color=\"#000000\">5</font></a>]\nEven in English, our sense of the word \"intelligence\" is\nsurprisingly recent.  Predecessors like \"understanding\" seem to\nhave had a broader meaning.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f6n\"><font color=\"#000000\">6</font></a>]\nThere is of course some uncertainty about how closely the remarks\nattributed to Confucius and Socrates resemble their actual opinions.\nI'm using these names as we use the name \"Homer,\" to mean the\nhypothetical people who said the things attributed to them.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f7n\"><font color=\"#000000\">7</font></a>]\n<i>Analects</i> VII:36, Fung trans.<br/><br/>Some translators use \"calm\" instead of \"happy.\"  One source of\ndifficulty here is that present-day English speakers have a different\nidea of happiness from many older societies.  Every language probably\nhas a word meaning \"how one feels when things are going well,\" but\ndifferent cultures react differently when things go well.  We react\nlike children, with smiles and laughter.  But in a more reserved\nsociety, or in one where life was tougher, the reaction might be a\nquiet contentment.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f8n\"><font color=\"#000000\">8</font></a>]\nIt may have been Andrew Wiles, but I'm not sure.  If anyone\nremembers such an interview, I'd appreciate hearing from you.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f9n\"><font color=\"#000000\">9</font></a>]\nConfucius claimed proudly that he had never invented\nanything—that he had simply passed on an accurate account of\nancient traditions.  [<i>Analects</i> VII:1] It's hard for us now to\nappreciate how important a duty it must have been in preliterate\nsocieties to remember and pass on the group's accumulated knowledge.\nEven in Confucius's time it still seems to have been the first duty\nof the scholar.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f10n\"><font color=\"#000000\">10</font></a>]\nThe bias toward wisdom in ancient philosophy may be exaggerated\nby the fact that, in both Greece and China, many of the first\nphilosophers (including Confucius and Plato) saw themselves as\nteachers of administrators, and so thought disproportionately about\nsuch matters.  The few people who did invent things, like storytellers,\nmust have seemed an outlying data point that could be ignored.<br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica Livingston,\nand Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2007-02-01T00:00:00Z"}
