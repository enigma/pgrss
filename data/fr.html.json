A typical\ntrajectory might be (1) to get started with a few tens of thousands\nfrom something like Y Combinator or individual angels, then \n(2) raise a few hundred thousand to a few million to build the company,\nand then (3) once the company is clearly succeeding, raise one or\nmore later rounds to accelerate growth.<br/><br/>Reality can be messier.  Some companies raise money twice in phase\n2.  Others skip phase 1 and go straight to phase 2.  And at Y Combinator \nwe get an increasing number of companies that have already\nraised amounts in the hundreds of thousands.  But the three phase\npath is at least the one about which individual startups' paths\noscillate.<br/><br/>This essay focuses on phase 2 fundraising.  That's the type the\nstartups we fund are doing on Demo Day, and this essay is the advice\nwe give them.<br/><br/>\n<b>Forces</b><br/><br/>Fundraising is hard in both senses: hard like lifting a heavy weight,\nand hard like solving a puzzle.  It's hard like lifting a weight\nbecause it's intrinsically hard to convince people to part with\nlarge sums of money.  That problem is irreducible; it should be\nhard.  But much of the other kind of difficulty can be eliminated.\nFundraising only seems a puzzle because it's an alien world to most\nfounders, and I hope to fix that by supplying a map through it.<br/><br/>To founders, the behavior of investors is often opaque — partly\nbecause their motivations are obscure, but partly because they\ndeliberately mislead you.  And the misleading ways of investors\ncombine horribly with the wishful thinking of inexperienced founders.\nAt YC we're always warning founders about this danger, and investors\nare probably more circumspect with YC startups than with other\ncompanies they talk to, and even so we witness a constant series\nof explosions as these two volatile components combine.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f1n\"><font color=\"#999999\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>If you're an inexperienced founder, the only way to survive is by\nimposing external constraints on yourself.  You can't trust your\nintuitions.  I'm going to give you a set of rules here that will\nget you through this process if anything will.  At certain moments\nyou'll be tempted to ignore them.  So rule number zero is: these\nrules exist for a reason.  You wouldn't need a rule to keep you\ngoing in one direction if there weren't powerful forces pushing you\nin another.<br/><br/>The ultimate source of the forces acting on you are the forces\nacting on investors.  Investors are pinched between two kinds of\nfear: fear of investing in startups that fizzle, and fear of missing\nout on startups that take off.  The cause of all this fear is the\nvery thing that makes startups such attractive investments: the\nsuccessful ones grow very fast.  But that fast growth means investors\ncan't wait around.  If you wait till a startup is obviously a\nsuccess, it's too late.  To get the really high returns, you have\nto invest in startups when it's still unclear how they'll do.  But\nthat in turn makes investors nervous they're about to invest in a\nflop.  As indeed they often are.<br/><br/>What investors would like to do, if they could, is wait.  When a\nstartup is only a few months old, every week that passes gives you\nsignificantly more information about them.  But if you wait too\nlong, other investors might take the deal away from you.  And of\ncourse the other investors are all subject to the same forces.  So\nwhat tends to happen is that they all wait as long as they can,\nthen when some act the rest have to.<br/><br/>\n<b>Don't raise money unless you want it and it wants you.</b><br/><br/>Such a high proportion of successful startups raise money that it\nmight seem fundraising is one of the defining qualities of a startup.\nActually it isn't.  <a href=\"growth.html\">Rapid growth</a> is what\nmakes a company a startup.  Most companies in a position to grow\nrapidly find that (a) taking outside money helps them grow faster,\nand (b) their growth potential makes it easy to attract such money.\nIt's so common for both (a) and (b) to be true of a successful\nstartup that practically all do raise outside money.  But there may\nbe cases where a startup either wouldn't want to grow faster, or\noutside money wouldn't help them to, and if you're one of them,\ndon't raise money.<br/><br/>The other time not to raise money is when you won't be able to.  If\nyou try to raise money before you can <a href=\"convince.html\">convince</a>\ninvestors, you'll not only waste your time, but also burn your\nreputation with those investors.<br/><br/>\n<b>Be in fundraising mode or not.</b><br/><br/>One of the things that surprises founders most about fundraising\nis how distracting it is.  When you start fundraising, everything\nelse grinds to a halt.  The problem is not the time fundraising\nconsumes but that it becomes the <a href=\"top.html\">top idea in\nyour mind</a>.  A startup can't endure that level of distraction\nfor long.  An early stage startup grows mostly because the founders\n<a href=\"ds.html\">make</a> it grow, and if the founders look away,\ngrowth usually drops sharply.<br/><br/>Because fundraising is so distracting, a startup should either be\nin fundraising mode or not.  And when you do decide to raise money,\nyou should focus your whole attention on it so you can get it done\nquickly and get back to work.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f2n\"><font color=\"#999999\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>You can take money from investors when you're not in fundraising\nmode.  You just can't expend any attention on it.  There are two\nthings that take attention: convincing investors, and negotiating\nwith them.  So when you're not in fundraising mode, you should take\nmoney from investors only if they require no convincing, and are\nwilling to invest on terms you'll take without negotiation.  For\nexample, if a reputable investor is willing to invest on a convertible\nnote, using standard paperwork, that is either uncapped or capped\nat a good valuation, you can take that without having to think.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f3n\"><font color=\"#999999\">3</font></a>]</font>\nThe terms will be whatever they turn out to be in your next\nequity round.  And \"no convincing\" means just that: zero time spent\nmeeting with investors or preparing materials for them.  If an\ninvestor says they're ready to invest, but they need you to come\nin for one meeting to meet some of the partners, tell them no, if\nyou're not in fundraising mode, because that's fundraising. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f4n\"><font color=\"#999999\">4</font></a>]</font>\nTell them politely; tell them you're focusing on the company right\nnow, and that you'll get back to them when you're fundraising; but\ndo not get sucked down the slippery slope.<br/><br/>Investors will try to lure you into fundraising when you're not.\nIt's great for them if they can, because they can thereby get a\nshot at you before everyone else.  They'll send you emails saying\nthey want to meet to learn more about you.  If you get cold-emailed\nby an associate at a VC firm, you shouldn't meet even if you are\nin fundraising mode.  Deals don't happen that way.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f5n\"><font color=\"#999999\">5</font></a>]</font>\nBut even\nif you get an email from a partner you should try to delay meeting\ntill you're in fundraising mode.  They may say they just want to\nmeet and chat, but investors never just want to meet and chat.  What\nif they like you?  What if they start to talk about giving you\nmoney?  Will you be able to resist having that conversation?  Unless\nyou're experienced enough at fundraising to have a casual conversation\nwith investors that stays casual, it's safer to tell them that you'd\nbe happy to later, when you're fundraising, but that right now you\nneed to focus on the company.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f6n\"><font color=\"#999999\">6</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Companies that are successful at raising money in phase 2 sometimes\ntack on a few investors after leaving fundraising mode.  This is\nfine; if fundraising went well, you'll be able to do it without\nspending time convincing them or negotiating about terms.<br/><br/>\n<b>Get introductions to investors.</b><br/><br/>Before you can talk to investors, you have to be introduced to them.\nIf you're presenting at a Demo Day, you'll be introduced to a whole\nbunch simultaneously.  But even if you are, you should supplement\nthese with intros you collect yourself.<br/><br/>Do you have to be introduced?  In phase 2, yes.  Some investors\nwill let you email them a business plan, but you can tell from the\nway their sites are organized that they don't really want startups\nto approach them directly.<br/><br/>Intros vary greatly in effectiveness.  The best type of intro is\nfrom a well-known investor who has just invested in you.  So when\nyou get an investor to commit, ask them to introduce you to other\ninvestors they respect.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f7n\"><font color=\"#999999\">7</font></a>]</font>\nThe next best type of intro is from a\nfounder of a company they've funded.  You can also get intros from\nother people in the startup community, like lawyers and reporters.<br/><br/>There are now sites like AngelList, FundersClub, and WeFunder that\ncan introduce you to investors.  We recommend startups treat them\nas auxiliary sources of money.  Raise money first from leads you\nget yourself.  Those will on average be better investors.  Plus\nyou'll have an easier time raising money on these sites once you\ncan say you've already raised some from well-known investors.<br/><br/>\n<b>Hear no till you hear yes.</b><br/><br/>Treat investors as saying no till they unequivocally say yes, in\nthe form of a definite offer with no contingencies.<br/><br/>I mentioned earlier that investors prefer to wait if they can.\nWhat's particularly dangerous for founders is the way they wait.\nEssentially, they lead you on.  They seem like they're about to\ninvest right up till the moment they say no.  If they even say no.\nSome of the worse ones never actually do say no; they just stop\nreplying to your emails.  They hope that way to get a free option\non investing.  If they decide later that they want to invest — usually\nbecause they've heard you're a hot deal — they can pretend they\njust got distracted and then restart the conversation as if they'd\nbeen about to.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f8n\"><font color=\"#999999\">8</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>That's not the worst thing investors will do.  Some will use language\nthat makes it sound as if they're committing, but which doesn't\nactually commit them.  And wishful thinking founders are happy to\nmeet them half way.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f9n\"><font color=\"#999999\">9</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Fortunately, the next rule is a tactic for neutralizing this behavior.\nBut to work it depends on you not being tricked by the no that\nsounds like yes.  It's so common for founders to be misled/mistaken\nabout this that we designed a <a href=\"http://ycombinator.com/hdp.html\">protocol</a> to fix the\nproblem.  If you believe an investor has committed, get them to\nconfirm it.  If you and they have different views of reality, whether\nthe source of the discrepancy is their sketchiness or your wishful\nthinking, the prospect of confirming a commitment in writing will\nflush it out.  And till they confirm, regard them as saying no.<br/><br/>\n<b>Do breadth-first search weighted by expected value.</b><br/><br/>When you talk to investors your m.o. should be breadth-first search,\nweighted by expected value.  You should always talk to investors\nin parallel rather than serially.  You can't afford the time it\ntakes to talk to investors serially, plus if you only talk to one\ninvestor at a time, they don't have the pressure of other investors\nto make them act.  But you shouldn't pay the same attention to every\ninvestor, because some are more promising prospects than others.\nThe optimal solution is to talk to all potential investors in\nparallel, but give higher priority to the more promising ones. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f10n\"><font color=\"#999999\">10</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Expected value = how likely an investor is to say yes, multiplied\nby how good it would be if they did.  So for example, an eminent\ninvestor who would invest a lot, but will be hard to convince, might\nhave the same expected value as an obscure angel who won't invest\nmuch, but will be easy to convince.  Whereas an obscure angel who\nwill only invest a small amount, and yet needs to meet multiple\ntimes before making up his mind, has very low expected value.  Meet\nsuch investors last, if at all. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f11n\"><font color=\"#999999\">11</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Doing breadth-first search weighted by expected value will save you\nfrom investors who never explicitly say no but merely drift away,\nbecause you'll drift away from them at the same rate.  It protects\nyou from investors who flake in much the same way that a distributed\nalgorithm protects you from processors that fail.  If some investor\nisn't returning your emails, or wants to have lots of meetings but\nisn't progressing toward making you an offer, you automatically\nfocus less on them.  But you have to be disciplined about assigning\nprobabilities.  You can't let how much you want an investor influence\nyour estimate of how much they want you.<br/><br/>\n<b>Know where you stand.</b><br/><br/>How do you judge how well you're doing with an investor, when\ninvestors habitually seem more positive than they are?  By looking\nat their actions rather than their words.  Every investor has some\ntrack they need to move along from the first conversation to wiring\nthe money, and you should always know what that track consists of,\nwhere you are on it, and how fast you're moving forward.<br/><br/>Never leave a meeting with an investor without asking what happens\nnext.  What more do they need in order to decide?  Do they need\nanother meeting with you?  To talk about what?  And how soon?  Do\nthey need to do something internally, like talk to their partners,\nor investigate some issue?  How long do they expect it to take?\nDon't be too pushy, but know where you stand.  If investors are\nvague or resist answering such questions, assume the worst; investors\nwho are seriously interested in you will usually be happy to talk\nabout what has to happen between now and wiring the money, because\nthey're already running through that in their heads. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f12n\"><font color=\"#999999\">12</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>If you're experienced at negotiations, you already know how to ask\nsuch questions.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f13n\"><font color=\"#999999\">13</font></a>]</font>\nIf you're not, there's a trick you can use\nin this situation.  Investors know you're inexperienced at raising\nmoney.  Inexperience there doesn't make you unattractive.  Being a\nnoob at technology would, if you're starting a technology startup,\nbut not being a noob at fundraising.  Larry and Sergey were noobs\nat fundraising.  So you can just confess that you're inexperienced\nat this and ask how their process works and where you are in it.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f14n\"><font color=\"#999999\">14</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>\n<b>Get the first commitment.</b><br/><br/>The biggest factor in most investors' opinions of you is the opinion\nof <a href=\"herd.html\">other investors</a>.  Once you start getting\ninvestors to commit, it becomes increasingly easy to get more to.\nBut the other side of this coin is that it's often hard to get the\nfirst commitment.<br/><br/>Getting the first substantial offer can be half the total difficulty\nof fundraising.  What counts as a substantial offer depends on who\nit's from and how much it is.  Money from friends and family doesn't\nusually count, no matter how much.  But if you get $50k from a well\nknown VC firm or angel investor, that will usually be enough to set\nthings rolling.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f15n\"><font color=\"#999999\">15</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>\n<b>Close committed money.</b><br/><br/>It's not a deal till the money's in the bank.  I often hear\ninexperienced founders say things like \"We've raised $800,000,\"\nonly to discover that zero of it is in the bank so far.  Remember\nthe twin fears that torment investors?  The fear of missing out\nthat makes them jump early, and the fear of jumping onto a turd\nthat results?  This is a market where people are exceptionally prone\nto buyer's remorse.  And it's also one that furnishes them plenty\nof excuses to gratify it.  The public markets snap startup investing\naround like a whip.  If the Chinese economy blows up tomorrow, all\nbets are off.  But there are lots of surprises for individual\nstartups too, and they tend to be concentrated around fundraising.\nTomorrow a big competitor could appear, or you could get C&amp;Ded, or\nyour cofounder could quit.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f16n\"><font color=\"#999999\">16</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Even a day's delay can bring news that causes an investor to change\ntheir mind.  So when someone commits, get the money.  Knowing where\nyou stand doesn't end when they say they'll invest.  After they say\nyes, know what the timetable is for getting the money, and then\nbabysit that process till it happens.  Institutional investors have\npeople in charge of wiring money, but you may have to hunt angels\ndown in person to collect a check.<br/><br/>Inexperienced investors are the ones most likely to get buyer's\nremorse.  Established ones have learned to treat saying yes as like\ndiving off a diving board, and they also have more brand to preserve.\nBut I've heard of cases of even top-tier VC firms welching on deals.<br/><br/>\n<b>Avoid investors who don't \"lead.\"</b><br/><br/>Since getting the first offer is most of the difficulty of fundraising,\nthat should be part of your calculation of expected value when you\nstart.  You have to estimate not just the probability that an\ninvestor will say yes, but the probability that they'd be the <i>first</i>\nto say yes, and the latter is not simply a constant fraction of the\nformer.  Some investors are known for deciding quickly, and those\nare extra valuable early on.<br/><br/>Conversely, an investor who will only invest once other investors\nhave is worthless initially.  And while most investors are influenced\nby how interested other investors are in you, there are some who\nhave an explicit policy of only investing after other investors\nhave.  You can recognize this contemptible subspecies of investor\nbecause they often talk about \"leads.\"  They say that they don't\nlead, or that they'll invest once you have a lead.  Sometimes they\neven claim to be willing to lead themselves, by which they mean\nthey won't invest till you get $x from other investors.  (It's great\nif by \"lead\" they mean they'll invest unilaterally, and in addition\nwill help you raise more.  What's lame is when they use the term\nto mean they won't invest unless you can raise more elsewhere.)\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f17n\"><font color=\"#999999\">17</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Where does this term \"lead\" come from?  Up till a few years ago,\nstartups raising money in phase 2 would usually raise equity rounds\nin which several investors invested at the same time using the same\npaperwork.  You'd negotiate the terms with one \"lead\" investor, and\nthen all the others would sign the same documents and all the money\nchange hands at the closing.<br/><br/>Series A rounds still work that way, but things now work differently\nfor most fundraising prior to the series A.  Now there are rarely\nactual rounds before the A round, or leads for them.  Now startups\nsimply raise money from investors one at a time till they feel they\nhave enough.<br/><br/>Since there are no longer leads, why do investors use that term?\nBecause it's a more legitimate-sounding way of saying what they\nreally mean.  All they really mean is that their interest in you\nis a function of other investors' interest in you.  I.e. the spectral\nsignature of all mediocre investors.  But when phrased in terms of\nleads, it sounds like there is something structural and therefore\nlegitimate about their behavior.<br/><br/>When an investor tells you \"I want to invest in you, but I don't\nlead,\" translate that in your mind to \"No, except yes if you turn\nout to be a hot deal.\"  And since that's the default opinion of any\ninvestor about any startup, they've essentially just told you\nnothing.<br/><br/>When you first start fundraising, the expected value of an investor\nwho won't \"lead\" is zero, so talk to such investors last if at all.<br/><br/>\n<b>Have multiple plans.</b><br/><br/>Many investors will ask how much you're planning to raise. This\nquestion makes founders feel they should be planning to raise a\nspecific amount.  But in fact you shouldn't.  It's a mistake to\nhave fixed plans in an undertaking as unpredictable as fundraising.<br/><br/>So why do investors ask how much you plan to raise?  For much the\nsame reasons a salesperson in a store will ask \"How much were you\nplanning to spend?\" if you walk in looking for a gift for a friend.\nYou probably didn't have a precise amount in mind; you just want\nto find something good, and if it's inexpensive, so much the better.\nThe salesperson asks you this not because you're supposed to have\na plan to spend a specific amount, but so they can show you only\nthings that cost the most you'll pay.<br/><br/>Similarly, when investors ask how much you plan to raise, it's not\nbecause you're supposed to have a plan.  It's to see whether you'd\nbe a suitable recipient for the size of investment they like to\nmake, and also to judge your ambition, reasonableness, and how far\nyou are along with fundraising.<br/><br/>If you're a wizard at fundraising, you can say \"We plan to raise\na $7 million series A round, and we'll be accepting termsheets next\ntuesday.\"  I've known a handful of founders who could pull that off\nwithout having VCs laugh in their faces.  But if you're in the\ninexperienced but earnest majority, the solution is analogous to\nthe solution I recommend for <a href=\"convince.html\">pitching</a>\nyour startup: do the right thing and then just tell investors what\nyou're doing.<br/><br/>And the right strategy, in fundraising, is to have multiple plans\ndepending on how much you can raise.  Ideally you should be able\nto tell investors something like: we can make it to profitability\nwithout raising any more money, but if we raise a few hundred\nthousand we can hire one or two smart friends, and if we raise a\ncouple million, we can hire a whole engineering team, etc.<br/><br/>Different plans match different investors.  If you're talking to a\nVC firm that only does series A rounds (though there are few of\nthose left), it would be a waste of time talking about any but your\nmost expensive plan.  Whereas if you're talking to an angel who\ninvests $20k at a time and you haven't raised any money yet, you\nprobably want to focus on your least expensive plan.<br/><br/>If you're so fortunate as to have to think about the upper limit\non what you should raise, a good rule of thumb is to multiply the\nnumber of people you want to hire times $15k times 18 months.  In\nmost startups, nearly all the costs are a function of the number\nof people, and $15k per month is the conventional total cost\n(including benefits and even office space) per person.  $15k per\nmonth is high, so don't actually spend that much.  But it's ok to\nuse a high estimate when fundraising to add a margin for error.  If\nyou have additional expenses, like manufacturing, add in those at\nthe end.  Assuming you have none and you think you might hire 20\npeople, the most you'd want to raise is 20 x $15k x 18 = $5.4\nmillion.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f18n\"><font color=\"#999999\">18</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>\n<b>Underestimate how much you want.</b><br/><br/>Though you can focus on different plans when talking to different\ntypes of investors, you should on the whole err on the side of\nunderestimating the amount you hope to raise.<br/><br/>For example, if you'd like to raise $500k, it's better to say\ninitially that you're trying to raise $250k.  Then when you reach\n$150k you're more than half done.  That sends two useful signals\nto investors: that you're doing well, and that they have to decide\nquickly because you're running out of room.  Whereas if you'd said\nyou were raising $500k, you'd be less than a third done at $150k.\nIf fundraising stalled there for an appreciable time, you'd start\nto read as a failure.<br/><br/>Saying initially that you're raising $250k doesn't limit you to\nraising that much.  When you reach your initial target and you still\nhave investor interest, you can just decide to raise more.  Startups\ndo that all the time.  In fact, most startups that are very successful\nat fundraising end up raising more than they originally intended.<br/><br/>I'm not saying you should lie, but that you should lower your\nexpectations initially.  There is almost no downside in starting\nwith a low number.  It not only won't cap the amount you raise, but\nwill on the whole tend to increase it.<br/><br/>A good metaphor here is angle of attack.  If you try to fly at too\nsteep an angle of attack, you just stall.  If you say right out of\nthe gate that you want to raise a $5 million series A round, unless\nyou're in a very strong position, you not only won't get that but\nwon't get anything. Better to start at a low angle of attack, build\nup speed, and then gradually increase the angle if you want.<br/><br/>\n<b>Be profitable if you can.</b><br/><br/>You will be in a much stronger position if your collection of plans\nincludes one for raising zero dollars — i.e. if you can make\nit to profitability without raising any additional money.  Ideally\nyou want to be able to say to investors \"We'll succeed no matter\nwhat, but raising money will help us do it faster.\"<br/><br/>There are many analogies between fundraising and dating, and this\nis one of the strongest.  No one wants you if you seem desperate.\nAnd the best way not to seem desperate is not to <i>be</i> desperate.\nThat's one reason we urge startups during YC to keep expenses low\nand to try to make it to <a href=\"ramenprofitable.html\">ramen\nprofitability</a> before Demo Day.  Though it sounds slightly\nparadoxical, if you want to raise money, the best thing you can do\nis get yourself to the point where you don't need to.<br/><br/>There are almost two distinct modes of fundraising: one in which\nfounders who need money knock on doors seeking it, knowing that\notherwise the company will die or at the very least people will\nhave to be fired, and one in which founders who don't need money\ntake some to grow faster than they could merely on their own revenues.\nTo emphasize the distinction I'm going to name them: type A fundraising\nis when you don't need money, and type B fundraising is when you\ndo.<br/><br/>Inexperienced founders read about famous startups doing what was\ntype A fundraising, and decide they should raise money too, since\nthat seems to be how startups work. Except when they raise money\nthey don't have a clear path to profitability and are thus doing\ntype B fundraising.  And they are then surprised how difficult and\nunpleasant it is.<br/><br/>Of course not all startups can make it to ramen profitability in a\nfew months.  And some that don't still manage to have the upper\nhand over investors, if they have some other advantage like\nextraordinary growth numbers or exceptionally formidable founders.\nBut as time passes it gets increasingly difficult to fundraise from\na position of strength without being profitable.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f19n\"><font color=\"#999999\">19</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>\n<b>Don't optimize for valuation.</b><br/><br/>When you raise money, what should your valuation be?  The most\nimportant thing to understand about valuation is that it's not that\nimportant.<br/><br/>Founders who raise money at high valuations tend to be unduly proud\nof it.  Founders are often competitive people, and since valuation\nis usually the only visible number attached to a startup, they end\nup competing to raise money at the highest valuation.  This is\nstupid, because fundraising is not the test that matters.  The real\ntest is revenue.  Fundraising is just a means to that end.  Being\nproud of how well you did at fundraising is like being proud of\nyour college grades.<br/><br/>Not only is fundraising not the test that matters, valuation is not\neven the thing to optimize about fundraising.  The number one thing\nyou want from phase 2 fundraising is to get the money you need, so\nyou can get back to focusing on the real test, the success of your\ncompany.  Number two is good investors. Valuation is at best third.<br/><br/>The empirical evidence shows just how unimportant it is.  Dropbox\nand Airbnb are the most successful companies we've funded so far,\nand they raised money after Y Combinator at premoney valuations of\n$4 million and $2.6 million respectively. Prices are so much higher\nnow that if you can raise money at all you'll probably raise it at\nhigher valuations than Dropbox and Airbnb.  So let that satisfy\nyour competitiveness.  You're doing better than Dropbox and Airbnb!\nAt a test that doesn't matter.<br/><br/>When you start fundraising, your initial valuation (or valuation\ncap) will be set by the deal you make with the first investor who\ncommits.  You can increase the price for later investors, if you\nget a lot of interest, but by default the valuation you got from\nthe first investor becomes your asking price.<br/><br/>So if you're raising money from multiple investors, as most companies\ndo in phase 2, you have to be careful to avoid raising the first\nfrom an over-eager investor at a price you won't be able to\nsustain.  You can of course lower your price if you need to (in\nwhich case you should give the same terms to investors who invested\nearlier at a higher price), but you may lose a bunch of leads in\nthe process of realizing you need to do this.<br/><br/>What you can do if you have eager first investors is raise money\nfrom them on an uncapped convertible note with an MFN clause.  This\nis essentially a way of saying that the valuation cap of the note\nwill be determined by the next investors you raise money from.<br/><br/>It will be easier to raise money at a lower valuation.  It shouldn't\nbe, but it is.  Since phase 2 prices vary at most 10x and the big\nsuccesses generate returns of at least 100x, investors should pick\nstartups entirely based on their estimate of the probability that\nthe company will be a big success and hardly at all on price.  But\nalthough it's a mistake for investors to care about price, a\nsignificant number do.  A startup that investors seem to like but\nwon't invest in at a cap of $x will have an easier time at $x/2.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f20n\"><font color=\"#999999\">20</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>\n<b>Yes/no before valuation.</b><br/><br/>Some investors want to know what your valuation is before they even\ntalk to you about investing.  If your valuation has already been\nset by a prior investment at a specific valuation or cap, you can\ntell them that number.  But if it isn't set because you haven't\nclosed anyone yet, and they try to push you to name a price, resist\ndoing so.  If this would be the first investor you've closed, then\nthis could be the tipping point of fundraising. That means closing\nthis investor is the first priority, and you need to get the\nconversation onto that instead of being dragged sideways into a\ndiscussion of price.<br/><br/>Fortunately there is a way to avoid naming a price in this situation.\nAnd it is not just a negotiating trick; it's how you (both) should\nbe operating.  Tell them that valuation is not the most important\nthing to you and that you haven't thought much about it, that you\nare looking for investors you want to partner with and who want to\npartner with you, and that you should talk first about whether they\nwant to invest at all.  Then if they decide they do want to invest,\nyou can figure out a price. But first things first.<br/><br/>Since valuation isn't that important and getting fundraising rolling\nis, we usually tell founders to give the first investor who commits\nas low a price as they need to.  This is a safe technique so long\nas you combine it with the next one. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f21n\"><font color=\"#999999\">21</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>\n<b>Beware \"valuation sensitive\" investors.</b><br/><br/>Occasionally you'll encounter investors who describe themselves as\n\"valuation sensitive.\"  What this means in practice is that they\nare compulsive negotiators who will suck up a lot of your time\ntrying to push your price down.  You should therefore never approach\nsuch investors first. While you shouldn't chase high valuations,\nyou also don't want your valuation to be set artificially low because\nthe first investor who committed happened to be a compulsive\nnegotiator.  Some such investors have value, but the time to approach\nthem is near the end of fundraising, when you're in a position to\nsay \"this is the price everyone else has paid; take it or leave it\"\nand not mind if they leave it.  This way, you'll not only get market\nprice, but it will also take less time.<br/><br/>Ideally you know which investors have a reputation for being\n\"valuation sensitive\" and can postpone dealing with them till last,\nbut occasionally one you didn't know about will pop up early on.\nThe rule of doing breadth first search weighted by expected value\nalready tells you what to do in this case: slow down your interactions\nwith them.<br/><br/>There are a handful of investors who will try to invest at a lower\nvaluation even when your price has already been set.  Lowering your\nprice is a backup plan you resort to when you discover you've let\nthe price get set too high to close all the money you need.  So\nyou'd only want to talk to this sort of investor if you were about\nto do that anyway.  But since investor meetings have to be arranged\nat least a few days in advance and you can't predict when you'll\nneed to resort to lowering your price, this means in practice that\nyou should approach this type of investor last if at all.<br/><br/>If you're surprised by a lowball offer, treat it as a backup offer\nand delay responding to it.  When someone makes an offer in good\nfaith, you have a moral obligation to respond in a reasonable time.\nBut lowballing you is a dick move that should be met with the\ncorresponding countermove.<br/><br/>\n<b>Accept offers greedily.</b><br/><br/>I'm a little leery of using the term \"greedily\" when writing about\nfundraising lest non-programmers misunderstand me, but a greedy\nalgorithm is simply one that doesn't try to look into the future.\nA greedy algorithm takes the best of the options in front of it\nright now.  And that is how startups should approach fundraising\nin phases 2 and later.  Don't try to look into the future because\n(a) the future is unpredictable, and indeed in this business you're\noften being deliberately misled about it and (b) your first priority\nin fundraising should be to get it finished and get back to work\nanyway.<br/><br/>If someone makes you an acceptable offer, take it.  If you have\nmultiple incompatible offers, take the best.  Don't reject an\nacceptable offer in the hope of getting a better one in the future.<br/><br/>These simple rules cover a wide variety of cases.  If you're raising\nmoney from many investors, roll them up as they say yes.  As you\nstart to feel you've raised enough, the threshold for acceptable\nwill start to get higher.<br/><br/>In practice offers exist for stretches of time, not points.  So\nwhen you get an acceptable offer that would be incompatible with\nothers (e.g. an offer to invest most of the money you need), you\ncan tell the other investors you're talking to that you have an\noffer good enough to accept, and give them a few days to make their\nown.  This could lose you some that might have made an offer if\nthey had more time.  But by definition you don't care; the initial\noffer was acceptable.<br/><br/>Some investors will try to prevent others from having time to decide\nby giving you an \"exploding\" offer, meaning one that's only valid\nfor a few days.  Offers from the very best investors explode less\nfrequently and less rapidly — Fred Wilson never gives exploding\noffers, for example — because they're confident you'll pick\nthem.  But lower-tier investors sometimes give offers with very\nshort fuses, because they believe no one who had other options would\nchoose them.  A deadline of three working days is acceptable.  You\nshouldn't need more than that if you've been talking to investors\nin parallel.  But a deadline any shorter is a sign you're dealing\nwith a sketchy investor.  You can usually call their bluff, and you\nmay need to.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f22n\"><font color=\"#999999\">22</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>It might seem that instead of accepting offers greedily, your goal\nshould be to get the best investors as partners.  That is certainly\na good goal, but in phase 2 \"get the best investors\" only rarely\nconflicts with \"accept offers greedily,\" because the best investors\ndon't usually take any longer to decide than the others.  The only\ncase where the two strategies give conflicting advice is when you\nhave to forgo an offer from an acceptable investor to see if you'll\nget an offer from a better one.  If you talk to investors in parallel\nand push back on exploding offers with excessively short deadlines,\nthat will almost never happen.  But if it does, \"get the best\ninvestors\" is in the average case bad advice.  The best investors\nare also the most selective, because they get their pick of all the\nstartups.  They reject nearly everyone they talk to, which means\nin the average case it's a bad trade to exchange a definite offer\nfrom an acceptable investor for a potential offer from a better\none.<br/><br/>(The situation is different in phase 1.  You can't apply to all the\nincubators in parallel, because some offset their schedules to\nprevent this.  In phase 1, \"accept offers greedily\" and \"get the\nbest investors\" do conflict, so if you want to apply to multiple\nincubators, you should do it in such a way that the ones you want\nmost decide first.)<br/><br/>Sometimes when you're raising money from multiple investors, a\nseries A will emerge out of those conversations, and these rules\neven cover what to do in that case.  When an investor starts to\ntalk to you about a series A, keep taking smaller investments till\nthey actually give you a termsheet.  There's no practical difficulty.\nIf the smaller investments are on convertible notes, they'll just\nconvert into the series A round.  The series A investor won't like\nhaving all these other random investors as bedfellows, but if it\nbothers them so much they should get on with giving you a termsheet.\nTill they do, you don't know for sure they will, and the greedy\nalgorithm tells you what to do.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f23n\"><font color=\"#999999\">23</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>\n<b>Don't sell more than 25% in phase 2.</b><br/><br/>If you do well, you will probably raise a series A round eventually.\nI say probably because things are changing with series A rounds.\nStartups may start to skip them.  But only one company we've funded\nhas so far, so tentatively assume the path to huge passes through\nan A round.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f24n\"><font color=\"#999999\">24</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Which means you should avoid doing things in earlier rounds that\nwill mess up raising an A round.  For example, if you've sold more\nthan about 40% of your company total, it starts to get harder to\nraise an A round, because VCs worry there will not be enough stock\nleft to keep the founders motivated.<br/><br/>Our rule of thumb is not to sell more than 25% in phase 2, on top\nof whatever you sold in phase 1, which should be less than 15%.  If\nyou're raising money on uncapped notes, you'll have to guess what\nthe eventual equity round valuation might be.  Guess conservatively.<br/><br/>(Since the goal of this rule is to avoid messing up the series A,\nthere's obviously an exception if you end up raising a series A in\nphase 2, as a handful of startups do.)<br/><br/>\n<b>Have one person handle fundraising.</b><br/><br/>If you have multiple founders, pick one to handle fundraising so\nthe other(s) can keep working on the company.  And since the danger\nof fundraising is not the time taken up by the actual meetings but\nthat it becomes the top idea in your mind, the founder who handles\nfundraising should make a conscious effort to insulate the other\nfounder(s) from the details of the process.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f25n\"><font color=\"#999999\">25</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>(If the founders mistrust one another, this could cause some friction.\nBut if the founders mistrust one another, you have worse problems\nto worry about than how to organize fundraising.)<br/><br/>The founder who handles fundraising should be the CEO, who should\nin turn be the most formidable of the founders.  Even if the CEO\nis a programmer and another founder is a salesperson?  Yes.  If you\nhappen to be that type of founding team, you're effectively a single\nfounder when it comes to fundraising.<br/><br/>It's ok to bring all the founders to meet an investor who will\ninvest a lot, and who needs this meeting as the final step before\ndeciding.  But wait till that point.  Introducing an investor to\nyour cofounder(s) should be like introducing a girl/boyfriend to\nyour parents — something you do only when things reach a certain\nstage of seriousness.<br/><br/>Even if there are still one or more founders focusing on the company\nduring fundraising, growth will slow.  But try to get as much growth\nas you can, because fundraising is a segment of time, not a point,\nand what happens to the company during that time affects the outcome.\nIf your numbers grow significantly between two investor meetings,\ninvestors will be hot to close, and if your numbers are flat or\ndown they'll start to get cold feet.<br/><br/>\n<b>You'll need an executive summary and (maybe) a deck.</b><br/><br/>Traditionally phase 2 fundraising consists of presenting a slide\ndeck in person to investors.  Sequoia describes what such a deck\nshould <a href=\"http://www.sequoiacap.com/ideas\">contain</a>, and\nsince they're the customer you can take their word for it.<br/><br/>I say \"traditionally\" because I'm ambivalent about decks, and (though\nperhaps this is wishful thinking) they seem to be on the way out.\nA lot of the most successful startups we fund never make decks in\nphase 2.  They just talk to investors and explain what they plan\nto do.  Fundraising usually takes off fast for the startups that\nare most successful at it, and they're thus able to excuse themselves\nby saying that they haven't had time to make a deck.<br/><br/>You'll also want an executive summary, which should be no more than\na page long and describe in the most matter of fact language what\nyou plan to do, why it's a good idea, and what progress you've made\nso far.  The point of the summary is to remind the investor (who\nmay have met many startups that day) what you talked about.<br/><br/>Assume that if you give someone a copy of your deck or executive\nsummary, it will be passed on to whoever you'd least like to have\nit.  But don't refuse on that account to give copies to investors\nyou meet.  You just have to treat such leaks as a cost of doing\nbusiness.  In practice it's not that high a cost.  Though founders\nare rightly indignant when their plans get leaked to competitors,\nI can't think of a startup whose outcome has been affected by it.<br/><br/>Sometimes an investor will ask you to send them your deck and/or\nexecutive summary before they decide whether to meet with you.  I\nwouldn't do that.  It's a sign they're not really interested.<br/><br/>\n<b>Stop fundraising when it stops working.</b><br/><br/>When do you stop fundraising?  Ideally when you've raised enough.\nBut what if you haven't raised as much as you'd like?  When do you\ngive up?<br/><br/>It's hard to give general advice about this, because there have\nbeen cases of startups that kept trying to raise money even when\nit seemed hopeless, and miraculously succeeded. But what I usually\ntell founders is to stop fundraising when you start to get a lot\nof air in the straw.  When you're drinking through a straw, you can\ntell when you get to the end of the liquid because you start to get\na lot of air in the straw.  When your fundraising options run out,\nthey usually run out in the same way.  Don't keep sucking on the\nstraw if you're just getting air.  It's not going to get better.<br/><br/>\n<b>Don't get addicted to fundraising.</b><br/><br/>Fundraising is a chore for most founders, but some find it more\ninteresting than working on their startup.  The work at an early\nstage startup often consists of unglamorous <a href=\"schlep.html\">schleps</a>.  Whereas fundraising, when it's\ngoing well, can be quite the opposite.  Instead of sitting in your\ngrubby apartment listening to users complain about bugs in your\nsoftware, you're being offered millions of dollars by famous investors\nover lunch at a nice restaurant.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f26n\"><font color=\"#999999\">26</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The danger of fundraising is particularly acute for people who are\ngood at it.  It's always fun to work on something you're good at.\nIf you're one of these people, beware.  Fundraising is not what\nwill make your company successful.  Listening to users complain\nabout bugs in your software is what will make you successful.  And\nthe big danger of getting addicted to fundraising is not merely\nthat you'll spend too long on it or raise too much money.  It's\nthat you'll start to think of yourself as being already successful,\nand lose your taste for the schleps you need to undertake to actually\nbe successful.  Startups can be destroyed by this.<br/><br/>When I see a startup with young founders that is fabulously successful\nat fundraising, I mentally decrease my estimate of the probability\nthat they'll succeed.  The press may be writing about them as if\nthey'd been anointed as the next Google, but I'm thinking \"this is\ngoing to end badly.\"<br/><br/>\n<b>Don't raise too much.</b><br/><br/>Though only a handful of startups have to worry about this, it is\npossible to raise too much.  The dangers of raising too much are\nsubtle but insidious.  One is that it will set impossibly high\nexpectations.  If you raise an excessive amount of money, it will\nbe at a high valuation, and the danger of raising money at too high\na valuation is that you won't be able to increase it sufficiently\nthe next time you raise money.<br/><br/>A company's valuation is expected to rise each time it raises money.\nIf not it's a sign of a company in trouble, which makes you\nunattractive to investors.  So if you raise money in phase 2 at a\npost-money valuation of $30 million, the pre-money valuation of\nyour next round, if you want to raise one, is going to have to be\nat least $50 million.  And you have to be doing really, really well\nto raise money at $50 million.<br/><br/>It's very dangerous to let the competitiveness of your current round\nset the performance threshold you have to meet to raise your next\none, because the two are only loosely coupled.<br/><br/>But the money itself may be more dangerous than the valuation.  The\nmore you raise, the more you spend, and spending a lot of money can\nbe disastrous for an early stage startup.  Spending a lot makes it\nharder to become profitable, and perhaps even worse, it makes you\nmore rigid, because the main way to spend money is people, and the\nmore people you have, the harder it is to change directions.  So\nif you do raise a huge amount of money, don't spend it.  (You will\nfind that advice almost impossible to follow, so hot will be the\nmoney burning a hole in your pocket, but I feel obliged at least\nto try.)<br/><br/>\n<b>Be nice.</b><br/><br/>Startups raising money occasionally alienate investors by seeming\narrogant.  Sometimes because they are arrogant, and sometimes because\nthey're noobs clumsily attempting to mimic the toughness they've\nobserved in experienced founders.<br/><br/>It's a mistake to behave arrogantly to investors.  While there are\ncertain situations in which certain investors like certain kinds\nof arrogance, investors vary greatly in this respect, and a flick\nof the whip that will bring one to heel will make another roar with\nindignation.  The only safe strategy is never to seem arrogant at\nall.<br/><br/>That will require some diplomacy if you follow the advice I've given\nhere, because the advice I've given is essentially how to play\nhardball back.  When you refuse to meet an investor because you're\nnot in fundraising mode, or slow down your interactions with an\ninvestor who moves too slow, or treat a contingent offer as the no\nit actually is and then, by accepting offers greedily, end up leaving\nthat investor out, you're going to be doing things investors don't\nlike.  So you must cushion the blow with soft words.  At YC we tell\nstartups they can blame us.  And now that I've written this, everyone\nelse can blame me if they want.  That plus the inexperience card\nshould work in most situations: sorry, we think you're great, but\nPG said startups shouldn't ___, and since we're new to fundraising,\nwe feel like we have to play it safe.<br/><br/>The danger of behaving arrogantly is greatest when you're doing\nwell.  When everyone wants you, it's hard not to let it go to your\nhead.  Especially if till recently no one wanted you.  But restrain\nyourself.  The startup world is a small place, and startups have\nlots of ups and downs.  This is a domain where it's more true than\nusual that pride goeth before a fall.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f27n\"><font color=\"#999999\">27</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Be nice when investors reject you as well.  The best investors are\nnot wedded to their initial opinion of you.  If they reject you in\nphase 2 and you end up doing well, they'll often invest in phase\n3.  In fact investors who reject you are some of your warmest leads\nfor future fundraising.  Any investor who spent significant time\ndeciding probably came close to saying yes.  Often you have some\ninternal champion who only needs a little more evidence to convince\nthe skeptics.  So it's wise not merely to be nice to investors who\nreject you, but (unless they behaved badly) to treat it as the\nbeginning of a relationship.<br/><br/>\n<b>The bar will be higher next time.</b><br/><br/>Assume the money you raise in phase 2 will be the last you ever\nraise.  You must make it to profitability on this money if you can.<br/><br/>Over the past several years, the investment community has evolved\nfrom a strategy of anointing a small number of winners early and\nthen supporting them for years to a strategy of spraying money at\nearly stage startups and then ruthlessly culling them at the next\nstage.  This is probably the optimal strategy for investors.  It's\ntoo hard to pick winners early on.  Better to let the market do it\nfor you.  But it often comes as a surprise to startups how much\nharder it is to raise money in phase 3.<br/><br/>When your company is only a couple months old, all it has to be is\na promising experiment that's worth funding to see how it turns\nout.  The next time you raise money, the experiment has to have\nworked.  You have to be on a trajectory that leads to going public.\nAnd while there are some ideas where the proof that the experiment\nworked might consist of e.g. query response times, usually the proof\nis profitability.  Usually phase 3 fundraising has to be type A\nfundraising.<br/><br/>In practice there are two ways startups hose themselves between\nphases 2 and 3.  Some are just too slow to become profitable.  They\nraise enough money to last for two years.  There doesn't seem any\nparticular urgency to be profitable.  So they don't make any effort\nto make money for a year.  But by that time, not making money has\nbecome habitual.  When they finally decide to try, they find they\ncan't.<br/><br/>The other way companies hose themselves is by letting their expenses\ngrow too fast.  Which almost always means hiring too many people.\nYou usually shouldn't go out and hire 8 people as soon as you raise\nmoney at phase 2.  Usually you want to wait till you have growth\n(and thus usually revenues) to justify them.  A lot of VCs will\nencourage you to hire aggressively.  VCs generally tell you to spend\ntoo much, partly because as money people they err on the side of\nsolving problems by spending money, and partly because they want\nyou to sell them more of your company in subsequent rounds.  Don't\nlisten to them.<br/><br/>\n<b>Don't make things complicated.</b><br/><br/>I realize it may seem odd to sum up this huge treatise by saying\nthat my overall advice is not to make fundraising too complicated,\nbut if you go back and look at this list you'll see it's basically\na simple recipe with a lot of implications and edge cases.  Avoid\ninvestors till you decide to raise money, and then when you do,\ntalk to them all in parallel, prioritized by expected value, and\naccept offers greedily.  That's fundraising in one sentence.  Don't\nintroduce complicated optimizations, and don't let investors introduce\ncomplications either.<br/><br/>Fundraising is not what will make you successful.  It's just a means\nto an end.  Your primary goal should be to get it over with and get\nback to what will make you successful — making things and talking\nto users — and the path I've described will for most startups\nbe the surest way to that destination.<br/><br/>Be good, take care of yourselves, and <i>don't leave the path</i>.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nThe worst explosions happen when unpromising-seeming startups\nencounter mediocre investors.

Naive\nfounders think \"Wow, a VC is interested in us!\"  But an associate\nis not a VC.  They have no decision-making power.  And while they\nmay introduce startups they like to partners at their firm, the\npartners discriminate against deals that come to them this way.   I\ndon't know of a single VC investment that began with an associate\ncold-emailing a startup.  If you want to approach a specific firm,\nget an intro to a partner from someone they respect.<br/><br/>It's ok to talk to an associate if you get an intro to a VC firm\nor they see you at a Demo Day and they begin by having an associate\nvet you.

If an investor\n  seems very interested in you, they still probably won't invest.\n  The solution for this is to assume the worst — that an investor\n  is just feigning interest — until you get a definite commitment.\"\n</blockquote>\n[<a name=\"f10n\"><font color=\"#000000\">10</font></a>]\nThough you should probably pack investor meetings as closely\nas you can, Jeff Byun mentions one reason not to: if you pack\ninvestor meetings too closely, you'll have less time for your pitch\nto evolve.<br/><br/>Some founders deliberately schedule a handful of lame investors\nfirst, to get the bugs out of their pitch.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f11n\"><font color=\"#000000\">11</font></a>]\nThere is not an efficient market in this respect.  Some of the\nmost useless investors are also the highest maintenance.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f12n\"><font color=\"#000000\">12</font></a>]\nIncidentally, this paragraph is sales 101.  If you want to see\nit in action, go talk to a car dealer.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f13n\"><font color=\"#000000\">13</font></a>]\nI know one very smooth founder who used to end investor meetings\nwith \"So, can I count you in?\" delivered as if it were \"Can you\npass the salt?\"   Unless you're very smooth (if you're not sure...),\ndo not do this yourself.  There is nothing more unconvincing, for\nan investor, than a nerdy founder trying to deliver the lines meant\nfor a smooth one.<br/><br/>Investors are fine with funding nerds.  So if you're a nerd, just\ntry to be a good nerd, rather than doing a bad imitation of a smooth\nsalesman.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f14n\"><font color=\"#000000\">14</font></a>]\nIan Hogarth suggests a good way to tell how serious potential\ninvestors are: the resources they expend on you after the first\nmeeting.  An investor who's seriously interested will already be\nworking to help you even before they've committed.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f15n\"><font color=\"#000000\">15</font></a>]\nIn principle you might have to think about so-called \"signalling\nrisk.\"  If a prestigious VC makes a small seed investment in you,\nwhat if they don't want to invest the next time you raise money?\nOther investors might assume that the VC knows you well, since\nthey're an existing investor, and if they don't want to invest in\nyour next round, that must mean you suck.  The reason I say \"in\nprinciple\" is that in practice signalling hasn't been much of a\nproblem so far.  It rarely arises, and in the few cases where it\ndoes, the startup in question usually is doing badly and is doomed\nanyway.<br/><br/>If you have the luxury of choosing among seed investors, you can\nplay it safe by excluding VC firms.  But it isn't critical to.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f16n\"><font color=\"#000000\">16</font></a>]\nSometimes a competitor will deliberately threaten you with a\nlawsuit just as you start fundraising, because they know you'll\nhave to disclose the threat to potential investors and they hope\nthis will make it harder for you to raise money.  If this happens\nit will probably frighten you more than investors.  Experienced\ninvestors know about this trick, and know the actual lawsuits rarely\nhappen. So if you're attacked in this way, be forthright with\ninvestors.  They'll be more alarmed if you seem evasive than if you\ntell them everything.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f17n\"><font color=\"#000000\">17</font></a>]\nA related trick is to claim that they'll only invest contingently\non other investors doing so because otherwise you'd be \"undercapitalized.\"\nThis is almost always bullshit.  They can't estimate your minimum\ncapital needs that precisely.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f18n\"><font color=\"#000000\">18</font></a>]\nYou won't hire all those 20 people at once, and you'll probably\nhave some revenues before 18 months are out.  But those too are\nacceptable or at least accepted additions to the margin for error.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f19n\"><font color=\"#000000\">19</font></a>]\nType A fundraising is so much better that it might even be\nworth doing something different if it gets you there sooner.  One\nYC founder told me that if he were a first-time founder again he'd\n\"leave ideas that are up-front capital intensive to founders with\nestablished reputations.\"<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f20n\"><font color=\"#000000\">20</font></a>]\nI don't know whether this happens because they're innumerate,\nor because they believe they have zero ability to predict startup\noutcomes (in which case this behavior at least wouldn't be irrational).\nIn either case the implications are similar.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f21n\"><font color=\"#000000\">21</font></a>]\nIf you're a YC startup and you have an investor who for some\nreason insists that you decide the price, any YC partner can estimate\na market price for you.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f22n\"><font color=\"#000000\">22</font></a>]\nYou should respond in kind when investors behave upstandingly\ntoo.  When an investor makes you a clean offer with no deadline,\nyou have a moral obligation to respond promptly.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f23n\"><font color=\"#000000\">23</font></a>]\nTell the investors talking to you about an A round about the\nsmaller investments you raise as you raise them.  You owe them such\nupdates on your cap table, and this is also a good way to pressure\nthem to act.  They won't like you raising other money and may\npressure you to stop, but they can't legitimately ask you to commit\nto them till they also commit to you.  If they want you to stop\nraising money, the way to do it is to give you a series A termsheet\nwith a no-shop clause.<br/><br/>You can relent a little if the potential series A investor has a\ngreat reputation and they're clearly working fast to get you a\ntermsheet, particularly if a third party like YC is involved to\nensure there are no misunderstandings.  But be careful.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f24n\"><font color=\"#000000\">24</font></a>]\nThe company is Weebly, which made it to profitability on a\nseed investment of $650k.  They did try to raise a series A in the\nfall of 2008 but (no doubt partly because it was the fall of 2008)\nthe terms they were offered were so bad that they decided to skip\nraising an A round.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f25n\"><font color=\"#000000\">25</font></a>]\nAnother advantage of having one founder take fundraising\nmeetings is that you never have to negotiate in real time, which\nis something inexperienced founders should avoid.  One YC founder\ntold me:\n<blockquote>\n  Investors are professional negotiators and can negotiate on the\n  spot very easily.  If only one founder is in the room, you can\n  say \"I need to circle back with my co-founder\" before making any\n  commitments. I used to do this all the time.\n</blockquote>\n[<a name=\"f26n\"><font color=\"#000000\">26</font></a>]\nYou'll be lucky if fundraising feels pleasant enough to become\naddictive.  More often you have to worry about the other\nextreme — becoming demoralized when investors reject you.  As\none (very successful) YC founder wrote after reading a draft of\nthis:\n<blockquote>\n  It's hard to mentally deal with the sheer scale of rejection in\n  fundraising and if you are not in the right mindset you will fail.\n  Users may love you but these supposedly smart investors may not\n  understand you at all. At this point for me, rejection still\n  rankles but I've come to accept that investors are just not super\n  thoughtful for the most part and you need to play the game according\n  to certain somewhat depressing rules (many of which you are\n  listing) in order to win.\n</blockquote>\n[<a name=\"f27n\"><font color=\"#000000\">27</font></a>]\nThe actual sentence in the King James Bible is \"Pride goeth\nbefore destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.\"<br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Slava Akhmechet, Sam Altman, Nate Blecharczyk,\nAdora Cheung, Bill Clerico, John Collison, Patrick Collison, Parker\nConrad, Ron Conway, Travis Deyle, Jason Freedman, Joe Gebbia, Mattan\nGriffel, Kevin Hale, Jacob Heller, Ian Hogarth, Justin Kan, Professor\nMoriarty, Nikhil Nirmel, David Petersen, Geoff Ralston, Joshua\nReeves, Yuri Sagalov, Emmett Shear, Rajat Suri, Garry Tan, and Nick\nTomarello for reading drafts of this.<br/><br/></br></p></font>","date":"2013-09-01T00:00:00Z"}
