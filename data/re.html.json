{"href":"re.html","title":"The Refragmentation","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">January 2016<br/><br/>One advantage of being old is that you can see change happen in\nyour lifetime.  A lot of the change I've seen is fragmentation.  US\npolitics is much more polarized than it used to be.  Culturally we\nhave ever less common ground. The creative class flocks to a handful\nof happy cities, abandoning the rest.  And increasing economic\ninequality means the spread between rich and poor is growing too.\nI'd like to propose a hypothesis: that all these trends are instances\nof the same phenomenon.  And moreover, that the cause is not some\nforce that's pulling us apart, but rather the erosion of forces\nthat had been pushing us together.<br/><br/>Worse still, for those who worry about these trends, the forces\nthat were pushing us together were an anomaly, a one-time combination\nof circumstances that's unlikely to be repeated — and indeed, that\nwe would not want to repeat.<br/><br/>The two forces were war (above all World War II), and the rise of\nlarge corporations.<br/><br/>The effects of World War II were both economic and social.\nEconomically, it decreased variation in income.  Like all modern\narmed forces, America's were socialist economically.  From each\naccording to his ability, to each according to his need.  More or\nless.  Higher ranking members of the military got more (as higher\nranking members of socialist societies always do), but what they\ngot was fixed according to their rank.  And the flattening effect\nwasn't limited to those under arms, because the US economy was\nconscripted too.  Between 1942 and 1945 all wages were set by the\nNational War Labor Board. Like the military, they defaulted to\nflatness.  And this national standardization of wages was so pervasive\nthat its effects could still be seen years after the war ended.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f1n\"><font color=\"#999999\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Business owners weren't supposed to be making money either.  FDR\nsaid \"not a single war millionaire\" would be permitted.  To ensure\nthat, any increase in a company's profits over prewar levels was\ntaxed at 85%.  And when what was left after corporate taxes reached\nindividuals, it was taxed again at a marginal rate of 93%.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f2n\"><font color=\"#999999\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Socially too the war tended to decrease variation.  Over 16 million\nmen and women from all sorts of different backgrounds were brought\ntogether in a way of life that was literally uniform.  Service rates\nfor men born in the early 1920s approached 80%. And working toward\na common goal, often under stress, brought them still closer together.<br/><br/>Though strictly speaking World War II lasted less than 4 years for\nthe US, its effects lasted longer.  Wars make central governments\nmore powerful, and World War II was an extreme case of this.  In\nthe US, as in all the other Allied countries, the federal government\nwas slow to give up the new powers it had acquired.  Indeed, in\nsome respects the war didn't end in 1945; the enemy just switched\nto the Soviet Union.  In tax rates, federal power, defense spending,\nconscription, and nationalism, the decades after the war looked more\nlike wartime than prewar peacetime.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f3n\"><font color=\"#999999\">3</font></a>]</font>\nAnd the social effects\nlasted too.  The kid pulled into the army from behind a mule team\nin West Virginia didn't simply go back to the farm afterward.\nSomething else was waiting for him, something that looked a lot\nlike the army.<br/><br/>If total war was the big political story of the 20th century, the\nbig economic story was the rise of a new kind of company.  And this\ntoo tended to produce both social and economic cohesion.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f4n\"><font color=\"#999999\">4</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The 20th century was the century of the big, national corporation.\nGeneral Electric, General Foods, General Motors.  Developments in\nfinance, communications, transportation, and manufacturing enabled\na new type of company whose goal was above all scale.  Version 1\nof this world was low-res: a Duplo world of a few giant companies\ndominating each big market.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f5n\"><font color=\"#999999\">5</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The late 19th and early 20th centuries had been a time of consolidation,\nled especially by J. P. Morgan.  Thousands of companies run by their\nfounders were merged into a couple hundred giant ones run by\nprofessional managers. Economies of scale ruled the day.  It seemed\nto people at the time that this was the final state of things.  John\nD. Rockefeller said in 1880\n<blockquote>\n  The day of combination is here to stay. Individualism has gone,\n  never to return.\n</blockquote>\nHe turned out to be mistaken, but he seemed right for the next\nhundred years.<br/><br/>The consolidation that began in the late 19th century continued for\nmost of the 20th.  By the end of World War II, as Michael Lind\nwrites, \"the major sectors of the economy were either organized\nas government-backed cartels or dominated by a few oligopolistic\ncorporations.\"<br/><br/>For consumers this new world meant the same choices everywhere, but\nonly a few of them.  When I grew up there were only 2 or 3 of most\nthings, and since they were all aiming at the middle of the market\nthere wasn't much to differentiate them.<br/><br/>One of the most important instances of this phenomenon was in TV.\nHere there were 3 choices: NBC, CBS, and ABC. Plus public TV for\neggheads and communists.  The programs that the 3 networks offered were\nindistinguishable.  In fact, here there was a triple pressure toward\nthe center. If one show did try something daring, local affiliates\nin conservative markets would make them stop. Plus since TVs were\nexpensive, whole families watched the same shows together, so they\nhad to be suitable for everyone.<br/><br/>And not only did everyone get the same thing, they got it at the\nsame time.  It's difficult to imagine now, but every night tens of\nmillions of families would sit down together in front of their TV\nset watching the same show, at the same time, as their next door\nneighbors.  What happens now with the Super Bowl used to happen\nevery night. We were literally in sync.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f6n\"><font color=\"#999999\">6</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>In a way mid-century TV culture was good. The view it gave of the\nworld was like you'd find in a children's book, and it probably had\nsomething of the effect that (parents hope) children's books have\nin making people behave better.  But, like children's books, TV was\nalso misleading.  Dangerously misleading, for adults. In his\nautobiography, Robert MacNeil talks of seeing gruesome images that\nhad just come in from Vietnam and thinking, we can't show these to\nfamilies while they're having dinner.<br/><br/>I know how pervasive the common culture was, because I tried to opt\nout of it, and it was practically impossible to find alternatives.\nWhen I was 13 I realized, more from internal evidence than any\noutside source, that the ideas we were being fed on TV were crap,\nand I stopped watching it.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f7n\"><font color=\"#999999\">7</font></a>]</font>\nBut it wasn't just TV.  It seemed\nlike everything around me was crap.  The politicians all saying the\nsame things, the consumer brands making almost identical products\nwith different labels stuck on to indicate how prestigious they\nwere meant to be, the balloon-frame houses with fake \"colonial\"\nskins, the cars with several feet of gratuitous metal on each end\nthat started to fall apart after a couple years, the \"red delicious\"\napples that were red but only <xa href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/09/the-evil-reign-of-the-red-delicious/379892/\">nominally \napples. And in retrospect, it <i>was</i> crap.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f8n\"><font color=\"#999999\">8</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>But when I went looking for alternatives to fill this void, I found\npractically nothing.  There was no Internet then.  The only place\nto look was in the chain bookstore in our local shopping mall. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f9n\"><font color=\"#999999\">9</font></a>]</font>\nThere I found a copy of <i>The Atlantic</i>.  I wish I could say it became\na gateway into a wider world, but in fact I found it boring and\nincomprehensible.  Like a kid tasting whisky for the first time and\npretending to like it, I preserved that magazine as carefully as\nif it had been a book. I'm sure I still have it somewhere.  But\nthough it was evidence that there was, somewhere, a world that\nwasn't red delicious, I didn't find it till college.<br/><br/>It wasn't just as consumers that the big companies made us similar.\nThey did as employers too.  Within companies there were powerful\nforces pushing people toward a single model of how to look and act.\nIBM was particularly notorious for this, but they were only a little\nmore extreme than other big companies.  And the models of how to\nlook and act varied little between companies. Meaning everyone\nwithin this world was expected to seem more or less the same.  And\nnot just those in the corporate world, but also everyone who aspired\nto it — which in the middle of the 20th century meant most people\nwho weren't already in it.  For most of the 20th century, working-class\npeople tried hard to look middle class.  You can see it in old\nphotos.  Few adults aspired to look dangerous in 1950.<br/><br/>But the rise of national corporations didn't just compress us\nculturally.  It compressed us economically too, and on both ends.<br/><br/>Along with giant national corporations, we got giant national labor\nunions.  And in the mid 20th century the corporations cut deals\nwith the unions where they paid over market price for labor.  Partly\nbecause the unions were monopolies. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f10n\"><font color=\"#999999\">10</font></a>]</font>\nPartly because, as\ncomponents of oligopolies themselves, the corporations knew they\ncould safely pass the cost on to their customers, because their\ncompetitors would have to as well.  And partly because in mid-century\nmost of the giant companies were still focused on finding new ways\nto milk economies of scale.  Just as startups rightly pay AWS a\npremium over the cost of running their own servers so they can focus\non growth, many of the big national corporations were willing to\npay a premium for labor. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f11n\"><font color=\"#999999\">11</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>As well as pushing incomes up from the bottom, by overpaying unions,\nthe big companies of the 20th century also pushed incomes down at\nthe top, by underpaying their top management. Economist J. K.\nGalbraith wrote in 1967 that \"There are few corporations in which\nit would be suggested that executive salaries are at a maximum.\"\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f12n\"><font color=\"#999999\">12</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>To some extent this was an illusion.  Much of the de facto pay of\nexecutives never showed up on their income tax returns, because it\ntook the form of perks.  The higher the rate of income tax, the\nmore pressure there was to pay employees upstream of it.  (In the\nUK, where taxes were even higher than in the US, companies would\neven pay their kids' private school tuitions.)  One of the most\nvaluable things the big companies of the mid 20th century gave their\nemployees was job security, and this too didn't show up in tax\nreturns or income statistics. So the nature of employment in these\norganizations tended to yield falsely low numbers about economic\ninequality.  But even accounting for that, the big companies paid\ntheir best people less than market price.  There was no market; the\nexpectation was that you'd work for the same company for decades\nif not your whole career. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f13n\"><font color=\"#999999\">13</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Your work was so illiquid there was little chance of getting market\nprice. But that same illiquidity also encouraged you not to seek\nit.  If the company promised to employ you till you retired and\ngive you a pension afterward, you didn't want to extract as much\nfrom it this year as you could. You needed to take care of the\ncompany so it could take care of you.  Especially when you'd been\nworking with the same group of people for decades.  If you tried\nto squeeze the company for more money, you were squeezing the\norganization that was going to take care of <i>them</i>.  Plus if\nyou didn't put the company first you wouldn't be promoted, and if\nyou couldn't switch ladders, promotion on this one was the only way\nup. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f14n\"><font color=\"#999999\">14</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>To someone who'd spent several formative years in the armed forces,\nthis situation didn't seem as strange as it does to us now.  From\ntheir point of view, as big company executives, they were high-ranking\nofficers.  They got paid a lot more than privates.  They got to\nhave expense account lunches at the best restaurants and fly around\non the company's Gulfstreams.  It probably didn't occur to most of\nthem to ask if they were being paid market price.<br/><br/>The ultimate way to get market price is to work for yourself, by\nstarting your own company.  That seems obvious to any ambitious\nperson now.  But in the mid 20th century it was an alien concept.\nNot because starting one's own company seemed too ambitious, but\nbecause it didn't seem ambitious enough. Even as late as the 1970s,\nwhen I grew up, the ambitious plan was to get lots of education at\nprestigious institutions, and then join some other prestigious\ninstitution and work one's way up the hierarchy.  Your prestige was\nthe prestige of the institution you belonged to.  People did start\ntheir own businesses of course, but educated people rarely did,\nbecause in those days there was practically zero concept of starting\nwhat we now call a <a href=\"growth.html\"><u>startup</u></a>: \na business that starts small and grows\nbig.  That was much harder to do in the mid 20th century.  Starting\none's own business meant starting a business that would start small\nand stay small. Which in those days of big companies often meant\nscurrying around trying to avoid being trampled by elephants.  It\nwas more prestigious to be one of the executive class riding the\nelephant.<br/><br/>By the 1970s, no one stopped to wonder where the big prestigious\ncompanies had come from in the first place.  It seemed like they'd\nalways been there, like the chemical elements.  And indeed, there\nwas a double wall between ambitious kids in the 20th century and\nthe origins of the big companies.  Many of the big companies were\nroll-ups that didn't have clear founders.  And when they did, the\nfounders didn't seem like us.  Nearly all of them had been uneducated,\nin the sense of not having been to college.  They were what Shakespeare\ncalled rude mechanicals.  College trained one to be a member of the\nprofessional classes.  Its graduates didn't expect to do the sort\nof grubby menial work that Andrew Carnegie or Henry Ford started\nout doing. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f15n\"><font color=\"#999999\">15</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>And in the 20th century there were more and more college graduates.\nThey increased from about 2% of the population in 1900 to about 25%\nin 2000. In the middle of the century our two big forces intersect,\nin the form of the GI Bill, which sent 2.2 million World War II\nveterans to college.  Few thought of it in these terms, but the\nresult of making college the canonical path for the ambitious was\na world in which it was socially acceptable to work for Henry Ford,\nbut not to be Henry Ford.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f16n\"><font color=\"#999999\">16</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>I remember this world well. I came of age just as it was starting\nto break up. In my childhood it was still dominant. Not quite so\ndominant as it had been.  We could see from old TV shows and yearbooks\nand the way adults acted that people in the 1950s and 60s had been\neven more conformist than us.  The mid-century model was already\nstarting to get old. But that was not how we saw it at the time.\nWe would at most have said that one could be a bit more daring in\n1975 than 1965.  And indeed, things hadn't changed much yet.<br/><br/>But change was coming soon. And when the Duplo economy started to\ndisintegrate, it disintegrated in several different ways at once.\nVertically integrated companies literally dis-integrated because\nit was more efficient to.  Incumbents faced new competitors as (a)\nmarkets went global and (b) technical innovation started to trump\neconomies of scale, turning size from an asset into a liability.\nSmaller companies were increasingly able to survive as formerly\nnarrow channels to consumers broadened.  Markets themselves started\nto change faster, as whole new categories of products appeared. And\nlast but not least, the federal government, which had previously\nsmiled upon J. P. Morgan's world as the natural state of things,\nbegan to realize it wasn't the last word after all.<br/><br/>What J. P. Morgan was to the horizontal axis, Henry Ford was to the\nvertical.  He wanted to do everything himself. The giant plant he\nbuilt at River Rouge between 1917 and 1928 literally took in iron\nore at one end and sent cars out the other.  100,000 people worked\nthere. At the time it seemed the future. But that is not how car\ncompanies operate today.  Now much of the design and manufacturing\nhappens in a long supply chain, whose products the car companies\nultimately assemble and sell.  The reason car companies operate\nthis way is that it works better.  Each company in the supply chain\nfocuses on what they know best. And they each have to do it well\nor they can be swapped out for another supplier.<br/><br/>Why didn't Henry Ford realize that networks of cooperating companies\nwork better than a single big company? One reason is that supplier\nnetworks take a while to evolve. In 1917, doing everything himself\nseemed to Ford the only way to get the scale he needed. And the\nsecond reason is that if you want to solve a problem using a network\nof cooperating companies, you have to be able to coordinate their\nefforts, and you can do that much better with computers.  Computers\nreduce the transaction costs that Coase argued are the raison d'etre\nof corporations. That is a fundamental change.<br/><br/>In the early 20th century, big companies were synonymous with\nefficiency.  In the late 20th century they were synonymous with\ninefficiency.  To some extent this was because the companies\nthemselves had become sclerotic.  But it was also because our\nstandards were higher.<br/><br/>It wasn't just within existing industries that change occurred.\nThe industries themselves changed.  It became possible to make lots\nof new things, and sometimes the existing companies weren't the\nones who did it best.<br/><br/>Microcomputers are a classic example. The market was pioneered by\nupstarts like Apple. When it got big enough, IBM decided it was\nworth paying attention to.  At the time IBM completely dominated\nthe computer industry. They assumed that all they had to do, now\nthat this market was ripe, was to reach out and pick it.  Most\npeople at the time would have agreed with them.  But what happened\nnext illustrated how much more complicated the world had become.\nIBM did launch a microcomputer.  Though quite successful, it did\nnot crush Apple.  But even more importantly, IBM itself ended up\nbeing supplanted by a supplier coming in from the side — from\nsoftware, which didn't even seem to be the same business.  IBM's\nbig mistake was to accept a non-exclusive license for DOS.  It must\nhave seemed a safe move at the time.  No other computer manufacturer\nhad ever been able to outsell them. What difference did it make if\nother manufacturers could offer DOS too?  The result of that\nmiscalculation was an explosion of inexpensive PC clones.  Microsoft\nnow owned the PC standard, and the customer.  And the microcomputer\nbusiness ended up being Apple vs Microsoft.<br/><br/>Basically, Apple bumped IBM and then Microsoft stole its wallet.\nThat sort of thing did not happen to big companies in mid-century.\nBut it was going to happen increasingly often in the future.<br/><br/>Change happened mostly by itself in the computer business.  In other\nindustries, legal obstacles had to be removed first.  Many of the\nmid-century oligopolies had been anointed by the federal government\nwith policies (and in wartime, large orders) that kept out competitors.\nThis didn't seem as dubious to government officials at the time as\nit sounds to us. They felt a two-party system ensured sufficient\ncompetition in politics.  It ought to work for business too.<br/><br/>Gradually the government realized that anti-competitive policies\nwere doing more harm than good, and during the Carter administration\nit started to remove them. The word used for this process was\nmisleadingly narrow: deregulation.  What was really happening was\nde-oligopolization.  It happened to one industry after another.\nTwo of the most visible to consumers were air travel and long-distance\nphone service, which both became dramatically cheaper after\nderegulation.<br/><br/>Deregulation also contributed to the wave of hostile takeovers in\nthe 1980s.  In the old days the only limit on the inefficiency of\ncompanies, short of actual bankruptcy, was the inefficiency of their\ncompetitors.  Now companies had to face absolute rather than relative\nstandards.  Any public company that didn't generate sufficient\nreturns on its assets risked having its management replaced with\none that would.  Often the new managers did this by breaking companies\nup into components that were more valuable separately.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f17n\"><font color=\"#999999\">17</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Version 1 of the national economy consisted of a few big blocks\nwhose relationships were negotiated in back rooms by a handful of\nexecutives, politicians, regulators, and labor leaders.  Version 2\nwas higher resolution: there were more companies, of more different\nsizes, making more different things, and their relationships changed\nfaster. In this world there were still plenty of back room negotiations,\nbut more was left to market forces.  Which further accelerated the\nfragmentation.<br/><br/>It's a little misleading to talk of versions when describing a\ngradual process, but not as misleading as it might seem.  There was\na lot of change in a few decades, and what we ended up with was\nqualitatively different.  The companies in the S&amp;P 500 in 1958 had\nbeen there an average of 61 years. By 2012 that number was 18 years.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f18n\"><font color=\"#999999\">18</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The breakup of the Duplo economy happened simultaneously with the\nspread of computing power. To what extent were computers a precondition?\nIt would take a book to answer that. Obviously the spread of computing\npower was a precondition for the rise of startups.  I suspect it\nwas for most of what happened in finance too.  But was it a\nprecondition for globalization or the LBO wave?  I don't know, but\nI wouldn't discount the possibility.  It may be that the refragmentation\nwas driven by computers in the way the industrial revolution was\ndriven by steam engines.  Whether or not computers were a precondition,\nthey have certainly accelerated it.<br/><br/>The new fluidity of companies changed people's relationships with\ntheir employers. Why climb a corporate ladder that might be yanked\nout from under you?  Ambitious people started to think of a career\nless as climbing a single ladder than as a series of jobs that might\nbe at different companies. More movement (or even potential movement)\nbetween companies introduced more competition in salaries.  Plus\nas companies became smaller it became easier to estimate how much\nan employee contributed to the company's revenue.  Both changes\ndrove salaries toward market price. And since people vary dramatically\nin productivity, paying market price meant salaries started to\ndiverge.<br/><br/>By no coincidence it was in the early 1980s that the term \"yuppie\"\nwas coined.  That word is not much used now, because the phenomenon\nit describes is so taken for granted, but at the time it was a label\nfor something novel. Yuppies were young professionals who made lots\nof money.  To someone in their twenties today, this wouldn't seem\nworth naming.  Why wouldn't young professionals make lots of money?\nBut until the 1980s, being underpaid early in your career was part\nof what it meant to be a professional.  Young professionals were\npaying their dues, working their way up the ladder.  The rewards\nwould come later.  What was novel about yuppies was that they wanted\nmarket price for the work they were doing now.<br/><br/>The first yuppies did not work for startups. That was still in the\nfuture.  Nor did they work for big companies. They were professionals\nworking in fields like law, finance, and consulting.  But their example \nrapidly inspired their peers.  Once they saw that new BMW 325i, they \nwanted one too.<br/><br/>Underpaying people at the beginning of their career only works if\neveryone does it. Once some employer breaks ranks, everyone else\nhas to, or they can't get good people.  And once started this process\nspreads through the whole economy, because at the beginnings of\npeople's careers they can easily switch not merely employers but\nindustries.<br/><br/>But not all young professionals benefitted. You had to produce to\nget paid a lot.  It was no coincidence that the first yuppies worked\nin fields where it was easy to measure that.<br/><br/>More generally, an idea was returning whose name sounds old-fashioned\nprecisely because it was so rare for so long: that you could make\nyour fortune.  As in the past there were multiple ways to do it.\nSome made their fortunes by creating wealth, and others by playing\nzero-sum games. But once it became possible to make one's fortune,\nthe ambitious had to decide whether or not to.  A physicist who\nchose physics over Wall Street in 1990 was making a sacrifice that\na physicist in 1960 didn't have to think about.<br/><br/>The idea even flowed back into big companies.  CEOs of big companies\nmake more now than they used to, and I think much of the reason is\nprestige.  In 1960, corporate CEOs had immense prestige.  They were\nthe winners of the only economic game in town. But if they made as\nlittle now as they did then, in real dollar terms, they'd seem like\nsmall fry compared to professional athletes and whiz kids making\nmillions from startups and hedge funds. They don't like that idea,\nso now they try to get as much as they can, which is more than they\nhad been getting. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f19n\"><font color=\"#999999\">19</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Meanwhile a similar fragmentation was happening at the other end\nof the economic scale.  As big companies' oligopolies became less\nsecure, they were less able to pass costs on to customers and thus\nless willing to overpay for labor.  And as the Duplo world of a few\nbig blocks fragmented into many companies of different sizes — some\nof them overseas — it became harder for unions to enforce their\nmonopolies.  As a result workers' wages also tended toward market\nprice. Which (inevitably, if unions had been doing their job) tended\nto be lower.  Perhaps dramatically so, if automation had decreased\nthe need for some kind of work.<br/><br/>And just as the mid-century model induced social as well as economic\ncohesion, its breakup brought social as well as economic fragmentation.\nPeople started to dress and act differently.  Those who would later\nbe called the \"creative class\" became more mobile. People who didn't\ncare much for religion felt less pressure to go to church for\nappearances' sake, while those who liked it a lot opted for\nincreasingly colorful forms. Some switched from meat loaf to tofu,\nand others to Hot Pockets. Some switched from driving Ford sedans\nto driving small imported cars, and others to driving SUVs.  Kids\nwho went to private schools or wished they did started to dress\n\"preppy,\" and kids who wanted to seem rebellious made a conscious\neffort to look disreputable.  In a hundred ways people spread apart.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f20n\"><font color=\"#999999\">20</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Almost four decades later, fragmentation is still increasing.  Has\nit been net good or bad?  I don't know; the question may be\nunanswerable.  Not entirely bad though.  We take for granted the\nforms of fragmentation we like, and worry only about the ones we\ndon't. But as someone who caught the tail end of mid-century\n<a href=\"https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=well-adjusted&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3\"><u>conformism</u></a>, \nI can tell you it was no utopia.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f21n\"><font color=\"#999999\">21</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>My goal here is not to say whether fragmentation has been good or\nbad, just to explain why it's happening.  With the centripetal\nforces of total war and 20th century oligopoly mostly gone, what\nwill happen next?  And more specifically, is it possible to reverse\nsome of the fragmentation we've seen?<br/><br/>If it is, it will have to happen piecemeal.  You can't reproduce\nmid-century cohesion the way it was originally produced.  It would\nbe insane to go to war just to induce more national unity.  And\nonce you understand the degree to which the economic history of the\n20th century was a low-res version 1, it's clear you can't reproduce\nthat either.<br/><br/>20th century cohesion was something that happened at least in a\nsense naturally.  The war was due mostly to external forces, and\nthe Duplo economy was an evolutionary phase.  If you want cohesion\nnow, you'd have to induce it deliberately.  And it's not obvious\nhow.  I suspect the best we'll be able to do is address the symptoms\nof fragmentation.  But that may be enough.<br/><br/>The form of fragmentation people worry most about lately is <a href=\"ineq.html\"><u>economic inequality</u></a>, and if you want to eliminate\nthat you're up against a truly formidable headwind that has\nbeen in operation since the stone age. Technology.<br/><br/>Technology is\na lever. It magnifies work.  And the lever not only grows increasingly\nlong, but the rate at which it grows is itself increasing.<br/><br/>Which in turn means the variation in the amount of wealth people\ncan create has not only been increasing, but accelerating.  The\nunusual conditions that prevailed in the mid 20th century masked\nthis underlying trend.  The ambitious had little choice but to join\nlarge organizations that made them march in step with lots of other\npeople — literally in the case of the armed forces, figuratively\nin the case of big corporations. Even if the big corporations had\nwanted to pay people proportionate to their value, they couldn't\nhave figured out how.  But that constraint has gone now.  Ever since\nit started to erode in the 1970s, we've seen the underlying forces\nat work again.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f22n\"><font color=\"#999999\">22</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Not everyone who gets rich now does it by creating wealth, certainly.\nBut a significant number do, and the Baumol Effect means all their\npeers get dragged along too.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f23n\"><font color=\"#999999\">23</font></a>]</font>\nAnd as long as it's possible to\nget rich by creating wealth, the default tendency will be for\neconomic inequality to increase.  Even if you eliminate all the\nother ways to get rich.  You can mitigate this with subsidies at\nthe bottom and taxes at the top, but unless taxes are high enough\nto discourage people from creating wealth, you're always going to\nbe fighting a losing battle against increasing variation in\nproductivity.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f24n\"><font color=\"#999999\">24</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>That form of fragmentation, like the others, is here to stay.  Or\nrather, back to stay.  Nothing is forever, but the tendency toward\nfragmentation should be more forever than most things, precisely\nbecause it's not due to any particular cause.  It's simply a reversion\nto the mean. When Rockefeller said individualism was gone, he was\nright for a hundred years.  It's back now, and that's likely to be\ntrue for longer.<br/><br/>I worry that if we don't acknowledge this, we're headed for trouble.\nIf we think 20th century cohesion disappeared because of few policy\ntweaks, we'll be deluded into thinking we can get it back (minus\nthe bad parts, somehow) with a few countertweaks.  And then we'll\nwaste our time trying to eliminate fragmentation, when we'd be\nbetter off thinking about how to mitigate its consequences.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nLester Thurow, writing in 1975, said the wage differentials\nprevailing at the end of World War II had become so embedded that\nthey \"were regarded as 'just' even after the egalitarian pressures\nof World War II had disappeared.  Basically, the same differentials\nexist to this day, thirty years later.\" But Goldin and Margo think\nmarket forces in the postwar period also helped preserve the wartime\ncompression of wages — specifically increased demand for unskilled\nworkers, and oversupply of educated ones.<br/><br/>(Oddly enough, the American custom of having employers pay for\nhealth insurance derives from efforts by businesses to circumvent\nNWLB wage controls in order to attract workers.)<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nAs always, tax rates don't tell the whole story.  There were\nlots of exemptions, especially for individuals.  And in World War\nII the tax codes were so new that the government had little acquired\nimmunity to tax avoidance.  If the rich paid high taxes during the\nwar it was more because they wanted to than because they had to.<br/><br/>After the war, federal tax receipts as a percentage of GDP were\nabout the same as they are now. In fact, for the entire period since\nthe war, tax receipts have stayed close to 18% of GDP, despite\ndramatic changes in tax rates.  The lowest point occurred when\nmarginal income tax rates were highest: 14.1% in 1950.  Looking at\nthe data, it's hard to avoid the conclusion that tax rates have had\nlittle effect on what people actually paid.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nThough in fact the decade preceding the war had been a time\nof unprecedented federal power, in response to the Depression.\nWhich is not entirely a coincidence, because the Depression was one\nof the causes of the war.  In many ways the New Deal was a sort of\ndress rehearsal for the measures the federal government took during\nwartime.  The wartime versions were much more drastic and more\npervasive though.  As Anthony Badger wrote, \"for many Americans the\ndecisive change in their experiences came not with the New Deal but\nwith World War II.\"<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f4n\"><font color=\"#000000\">4</font></a>]\nI don't know enough about the origins of the world wars to\nsay, but it's not inconceivable they were connected to the rise of\nbig corporations. If that were the case, 20th century cohesion would\nhave a single cause.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f5n\"><font color=\"#000000\">5</font></a>]\nMore precisely, there was a bimodal economy consisting, in\nGalbraith's words, of \"the world of the technically dynamic, massively\ncapitalized and highly organized corporations on the one hand and\nthe hundreds of thousands of small and traditional proprietors on\nthe other.\" Money, prestige, and power were concentrated in the\nformer, and there was near zero crossover.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f6n\"><font color=\"#000000\">6</font></a>]\nI wonder how much of the decline in families eating together\nwas due to the decline in families watching TV together afterward.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f7n\"><font color=\"#000000\">7</font></a>]\nI know when this happened because it was the season Dallas\npremiered.

In the late 1970s the movie <i>Dawn of\nthe Dead</i> was shot there.

According to Michael Lind, when politicians\ntried to attack the A&amp;P supermarket chain because it was putting\nlocal grocery stores out of business, \"A&amp;P successfully defended\nitself by allowing the unionization of its workforce in 1938, thereby\ngaining organized labor as a constituency.\" I've seen this phenomenon\nmyself: hotel unions are responsible for more of the political\npressure against Airbnb than hotel companies.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f12n\"><font color=\"#000000\">12</font></a>]\nGalbraith was clearly puzzled that corporate executives would\nwork so hard to make money for other people (the shareholders)\ninstead of themselves.  He devoted much of <i>The New Industrial\nState</i> to trying to figure this out.<br/><br/>His theory was that professionalism had replaced money as a motive,\nand that modern corporate executives were, like (good) scientists,\nmotivated less by financial rewards than by the desire to do good\nwork and thereby earn the respect of their peers.  There is something\nin this, though I think lack of movement between companies combined\nwith self-interest explains much of observed behavior.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f13n\"><font color=\"#000000\">13</font></a>]\nGalbraith (p. 94) says a 1952 study of the 800 highest paid\nexecutives at 300 big corporations found that three quarters of\nthem had been with their company for more than 20 years.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f14n\"><font color=\"#000000\">14</font></a>]\nIt seems likely that in the first third of the 20th century\nexecutive salaries were low partly because companies then were more\ndependent on banks, who would have disapproved if executives got\ntoo much.  This was certainly true in the beginning. The first big\ncompany CEOs were J. P. Morgan's hired hands.<br/><br/>Companies didn't start to finance themselves with retained earnings\ntill the 1920s.  Till then they had to pay out their earnings in\ndividends, and so depended on banks for capital for expansion.\nBankers continued to sit on corporate boards till the Glass-Steagall\nact in 1933.<br/><br/>By mid-century big companies funded 3/4 of their growth from earnings.\nBut the early years of bank dependence, reinforced by the financial\ncontrols of World War II, must have had a big effect on social\nconventions about executive salaries.  So it may be that the lack\nof movement between companies was as much the effect of low salaries\nas the cause.<br/><br/>Incidentally, the switch in the 1920s to financing growth with\nretained earnings was one cause of the 1929 crash.  The banks now\nhad to find someone else to lend to, so they made more margin loans.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f15n\"><font color=\"#000000\">15</font></a>]\nEven now it's hard to get them to. One of the things I find\nhardest to get into the heads of would-be startup founders is how\nimportant it is to do certain kinds of menial work early in the\nlife of a company.  Doing <a href=\"ds.html\"><u>things that don't\nscale</u></a> is to how Henry Ford got started as a high-fiber diet is\nto the traditional peasant's diet: they had no choice but to do the\nright thing, while we have to make a conscious effort.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f16n\"><font color=\"#000000\">16</font></a>]\nFounders weren't celebrated in the press when I was a kid.\n\"Our founder\" meant a photograph of a severe-looking man with a\nwalrus mustache and a wing collar who had died decades ago. The\nthing to be when I was a kid was an <i>executive</i>. If you weren't\naround then it's hard to grasp the cachet that term had. The fancy\nversion of everything was called the \"executive\" model.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f17n\"><font color=\"#000000\">17</font></a>]\nThe wave of hostile takeovers in the 1980s was enabled by a\ncombination of circumstances: court decisions striking down state\nanti-takeover laws, starting with the Supreme Court's 1982 decision\nin Edgar v. MITE Corp.; the Reagan administration's comparatively\nsympathetic attitude toward takeovers; the Depository Institutions\nAct of 1982, which allowed banks and savings and loans to buy\ncorporate bonds; a new SEC rule issued in 1982 (rule 415) that made\nit possible to bring corporate bonds to market faster; the creation\nof the junk bond business by Michael Milken; a vogue for conglomerates\nin the preceding period that caused many companies to be combined\nthat never should have been; a decade of inflation that left many\npublic companies trading below the value of their assets; and not\nleast, the increasing complacency of managements.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f18n\"><font color=\"#000000\">18</font></a>]\nFoster, Richard. \"Creative Destruction Whips through Corporate\nAmerica.\" Innosight, February 2012.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f19n\"><font color=\"#000000\">19</font></a>]\nCEOs of big companies may be overpaid. I don't know enough\nabout big companies to say. But it is certainly not impossible for\na CEO to make 200x as much difference to a company's revenues as\nthe average employee.  Look at what Steve Jobs did for Apple when\nhe came back as CEO.  It would have been a good deal for the board\nto give him 95% of the company.  Apple's market cap the day Steve\ncame back in July 1997 was 1.73 billion. 5% of Apple now (January\n2016) would be worth about 30 billion.  And it would not be if Steve\nhadn't come back; Apple probably wouldn't even exist anymore.<br/><br/>Merely including Steve in the sample might be enough to answer the\nquestion of whether public company CEOs in the aggregate are overpaid.\nAnd that is not as facile a trick as it might seem, because the\nbroader your holdings, the more the aggregate is what you care\nabout.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f20n\"><font color=\"#000000\">20</font></a>]\nThe late 1960s were famous for social upheaval. But that was\nmore rebellion (which can happen in any era if people are provoked\nsufficiently) than fragmentation.

The main one was drilling for oil, which was open\nto newcomers because it was not something big companies could\ndominate through economies of scale.  How did individuals accumulate\nlarge fortunes in an era of such high taxes?  Giant tax loopholes\ndefended by two of the most powerful men in Congress, Sam Rayburn\nand Lyndon Johnson.<br/><br/>But becoming a Texas oilman was not in 1950 something one could\naspire to the way starting a startup or going to work on Wall Street\nwere in 2000, because (a) there was a strong local component and\n(b) success depended so much on luck.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f23n\"><font color=\"#000000\">23</font></a>]\nThe Baumol Effect induced by startups is very visible in\nSilicon Valley.
