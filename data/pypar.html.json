{"href":"pypar.html","title":"The Python Paradox","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">August 2004<br/><br/>In a recent <a href=\"gh.html\">talk</a> I said something that upset a lot of\npeople: that you could get smarter programmers to work on\na Python project than you could to work on a Java project.<br/><br/>I didn't mean by this that Java programmers are dumb.  I\nmeant that Python programmers are smart. It's a lot of\nwork to learn a new programming language.  And people don't\nlearn Python because it will get them a job; they learn it\nbecause they genuinely like to program and aren't satisfied with the languages they\nalready know.<br/><br/>Which makes them exactly the kind of programmers\ncompanies should want to hire.  Hence what, for lack of a better\nname, I'll call the Python paradox: if a company chooses to write\nits software in a comparatively esoteric language, they'll be able \nto hire better programmers, because they'll attract only those\nwho cared enough to learn it.  And for \nprogrammers the paradox is even more pronounced: the language\nto learn, if you want to get a good job, is a language that\npeople don't learn merely to get a job.<br/><br/>Only a few companies have been smart enough to realize this \nso far.  But there is a kind of selection going on here too: they're \nexactly the companies programmers would\nmost like to work for.  Google, for example.  When they     \nadvertise Java programming jobs, they also want Python experience.<br/><br/>A friend of mine who knows nearly all the widely used languages\nuses Python for most of his projects.  He says the main reason\nis that he likes the way source code looks.  That may seem\na frivolous reason to choose one language over another.\nBut it is not so frivolous as it sounds: when you program,\nyou spend more time reading code than writing it.\nYou push blobs of source code around the way a sculptor does\nblobs of clay.  So a language that makes source code ugly is\nmaddening to an exacting programmer, as clay full of lumps\nwould be to a sculptor.<br/><br/>At the mention of ugly source code, people will of course think\nof Perl.  But the superficial ugliness of Perl is not the sort\nI mean.  Real ugliness is not harsh-looking\nsyntax, but having to build programs out of the wrong\nconcepts.  Perl may look like a cartoon character swearing,\nbut there are \n<a href=\"icad.html\">cases</a> where it surpasses Python conceptually.<br/><br/>So far, anyway. Both languages are of course \n<a href=\"hundred.html\">moving</a> targets.  But they\nshare, along with Ruby (and Icon, and Joy, and J, and Lisp,\nand Smalltalk) the fact that\nthey're created by, and used by, people who really care about\nprogramming.   And those tend to be the ones who do it well.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2004-08-01T00:00:00Z"}
