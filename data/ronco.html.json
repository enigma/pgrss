{"href":"ronco.html","title":"The Ronco Principle","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">January 2015<br/><br/>No one, VC or angel, has invested in more of the top startups than\nRon Conway.  He knows what happened in every deal in the Valley,\nhalf the time because he arranged it.<br/><br/>And yet he's a super nice guy.  In fact, nice is not the word.\nRonco is good. I know of zero instances in which he has behaved\nbadly.  It's hard even to imagine.<br/><br/>When I first came to Silicon Valley I thought \"How lucky that someone\nso powerful is so benevolent.\"  But gradually I realized it wasn't\nluck.  It was by being benevolent that Ronco became so powerful.\nAll the deals he gets to invest in come to him through referrals.\nGoogle did. Facebook did. Twitter was a referral from Evan Williams\nhimself.  And the reason so many people refer deals to him is that\nhe's proven himself to be a good guy.<br/><br/>Good does not mean being a pushover.  I would not want to face an\nangry Ronco.  But if Ron's angry at you, it's because you did\nsomething wrong.  Ron is so old school he's Old Testament.  He will\nsmite you in his just wrath, but there's no malice in it.<br/><br/>In almost every domain there are advantages to seeming good.  It\nmakes people trust you.  But actually being good is an expensive\nway to seem good.  To an amoral person it might seem to be overkill.<br/><br/>In some fields it might be, but apparently not in the startup world.\nThough plenty of investors are jerks, there is a clear trend among\nthem: the most successful investors are also the most upstanding. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/ronco.html#f1n\"><font color=\"#999999\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>It was not always this way.  I would not feel confident saying that\nabout investors twenty years ago.<br/><br/>What changed?  The startup world became more transparent and more\nunpredictable.  Both make it harder to seem good without actually\nbeing good.<br/><br/>It's obvious why transparency has that effect.  When an investor\nmaltreats a founder now, it gets out.  Maybe not all the way to the\npress, but other founders hear about it, and that investor\nstarts to lose deals. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/ronco.html#f2n\"><font color=\"#999999\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The effect of unpredictability is more subtle.  It increases the\nwork of being inconsistent.  If you're going to be two-faced, you\nhave to know who you should be nice to and who you can get away\nwith being nasty to.  In the startup world, things change so rapidly\nthat you can't tell.  The random college kid you talk to today might\nin a couple years be the CEO of the hottest startup in the Valley.\nIf you can't tell who to be nice to, you have to be nice to everyone.\nAnd probably the only people who can manage that are the people who\nare genuinely good.<br/><br/>In a sufficiently connected and unpredictable world, you can't seem\ngood without being good.<br/><br/>As often happens, Ron discovered how to be the investor of the\nfuture by accident.  He didn't foresee the future of startup\ninvesting, realize it would pay to be upstanding, and force himself\nto behave that way. It would feel unnatural to him to behave any\nother way.  He was already \n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html\">living in the future</a>.<br/><br/>Fortunately that future is not limited to the startup world.  The\nstartup world is more transparent and unpredictable than most, but\nalmost everywhere the trend is in that direction.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nI'm not saying that if you sort investors by benevolence\nyou've also sorted them by returns, but rather that if you do a\nscatterplot with benevolence on the x axis and returns on the y,\nyou'd see a clear upward trend.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nY Combinator in particular, because it aggregates data\nfrom so many startups, has a pretty comprehensive view of\ninvestor behavior.<br/><br/>\n<b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman and Jessica Livingston for reading drafts of\nthis.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
