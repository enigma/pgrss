Startups are\nundergoing the same transformation that technology does when it becomes\ncheaper.<br/><br/>It's a pattern we see over and over in technology.  Initially\nthere's some device that's very expensive and made\nin small quantities.  Then someone discovers how to make them cheaply; \nmany more get built; and as a result they can be used in new ways.<br/><br/>Computers are a familiar example.  When I was a kid, computers were\nbig, expensive machines built one at a time.  Now they're a commodity.\nNow we can stick computers in everything.<br/><br/>This pattern is very old.  Most of the turning\npoints in economic history are instances of it.  It happened to\nsteel in the 1850s, and to power in the 1780s.\nIt happened to cloth manufacture in the thirteenth century, generating\nthe wealth that later brought about the Renaissance.  Agriculture\nitself was an instance of this pattern.<br/><br/>Now as well as being produced by startups, this pattern\nis happening <i>to</i> startups.  It's so cheap to start web startups\nthat orders of magnitudes more will be started.   If the pattern\nholds true, that should cause dramatic changes.<br/><br/><b>1. Lots of Startups</b><br/><br/>So my first prediction about the future of web startups is pretty\nstraightforward: there will be a lot of them.  When starting a\nstartup was expensive, you had to get the permission of investors\nto do it.  Now the only threshold is courage.<br/><br/>Even that threshold is getting lower, as people watch others take\nthe plunge and survive.  In the last batch of startups we funded,\nwe had several founders who said they'd thought of applying before,\nbut weren't sure and got jobs instead.  It was only after hearing\nreports of friends who'd done it that they decided to try it\nthemselves.<br/><br/>Starting a startup is hard, but having a 9 to 5 job is hard too,\nand in some ways a worse kind of hard.  In a startup you have lots\nof worries, but you don't have that feeling that your life is flying\nby like you do in a big company.  Plus in a startup you could make\nmuch more money.<br/><br/>As word spreads that startups work, the number may grow\nto a point that would now seem surprising.<br/><br/>We now think of it as normal to have a job at a company, but this\nis the thinnest of historical veneers.  Just two or three\nlifetimes ago, most people in what are now called industrialized\ncountries lived by farming.  So while it may seem surprising to\npropose that large numbers of people will change the way they make\na living, it would be more surprising if they didn't.<br/><br/><b>2. Standardization</b><br/><br/>When technology makes something dramatically cheaper, standardization\nalways follows.  When you make things in large volumes you tend\nto standardize everything that doesn't need to change.<br/><br/>At Y Combinator we still only have four people, so we try to\nstandardize everything.  We could hire employees, but we want to be\nforced to figure out how to scale investing.<br/><br/>We often tell startups to release a minimal version one quickly, \nthen let the needs of the users determine what to do\nnext.  In essense, let the market design the product.  We've\ndone the same thing ourselves.  We think of the techniques we're\ndeveloping for dealing with large numbers of startups as like\nsoftware.  Sometimes it literally is software, like \n<a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com\">Hacker News</a> and\nour application system.<br/><br/>One of the most important things we've been working on standardizing\nare investment terms.  Till now investment terms have been\nindividually negotiated.\nThis is a problem for founders, because it makes raising money\ntake longer and cost more in legal fees.  So as well as using the\nsame paperwork for every deal we do, we've commissioned generic\nangel paperwork that all the startups we fund can use for future\nrounds.<br/><br/>Some investors will still want to cook up their own deal terms.\nSeries A rounds, where you raise a million dollars or more, will\nbe custom deals for the forseeable future.  But I think angel rounds\nwill start to be done mostly with standardized agreements.  An angel\nwho wants to insert a bunch of complicated terms into the agreement\nis probably not one you want anyway.<br/><br/><b>3. New Attitude to Acquisition</b><br/><br/>Another thing I see starting to get standardized is acquisitions.\nAs the volume of startups increases, big companies will start to\ndevelop standardized procedures that make acquisitions little\nmore work than hiring someone.<br/><br/>Google is the leader here, as in so many areas of technology.  They\nbuy a lot of startups— more than most people realize, because they\nonly announce a fraction of them.   And being Google, they're\nfiguring out how to do it efficiently.<br/><br/>One problem they've solved is how to think about acquisitions.  For\nmost companies, acquisitions still carry some stigma of inadequacy.\nCompanies do them because they have to, but there's usually some\nfeeling they shouldn't have to—that their own programmers should\nbe able to build everything they need.<br/><br/>Google's example should cure the rest of the world of this idea.\nGoogle has by far the best programmers of any public technology\ncompany.  If they don't have a problem doing acquisitions, the\nothers should have even less problem.  However many Google does,\nMicrosoft should do ten times as many.<br/><br/>One reason Google doesn't have a problem with acquisitions\nis that they know first-hand the quality of the people they can get\nthat way.  Larry and Sergey only started Google after making the\nrounds of the search engines trying to sell their idea and finding\nno takers.  They've <i>been</i> the guys coming in to visit the big\ncompany, so they know who might be sitting across that conference\ntable from them.<br/><br/><b>4. Riskier Strategies are Possible</b><br/><br/>Risk is always proportionate to reward.  The way to get really big\nreturns is to do things that seem crazy, like starting a new search\nengine in 1998, or turning down a billion dollar acquisition offer.<br/><br/>This has traditionally been a problem in venture funding.  Founders\nand investors have different attitudes to risk.  Knowing that risk\nis on average proportionate to reward, investors like risky strategies,\nwhile founders, who don't have a big enough sample size to care\nwhat's true on average, tend to be more conservative.<br/><br/>If startups are easy to start, this conflict goes away, because\nfounders can start them younger, when it's rational to take more\nrisk, and can start more startups total in their careers.  When\nfounders can do lots of startups, they can start to look at the\nworld in the same portfolio-optimizing way as investors.  And that\nmeans the overall amount of wealth created can be greater, because\nstrategies can be riskier.<br/><br/><b>5. Younger, Nerdier Founders</b><br/><br/>If startups become a cheap commodity, more people will be able to\nhave them, just as more people could have computers once microprocessors\nmade them cheap.  And in particular, younger and more technical\nfounders will be able to start startups than could before.<br/><br/>Back when it cost a lot to start a startup, you had to convince\ninvestors to let you do it.  And that required very different skills\nfrom actually doing the startup.  If investors were perfect judges,\nthe two would require exactly the same skills.  But unfortunately\nmost investors are terrible judges.  I know because I see behind\nthe scenes what an enormous amount of work it takes to raise money,\nand the amount of selling required in an industry is always inversely\nproportional to the judgement of the buyers.<br/><br/>Fortunately, if startups get cheaper to start, there's another way\nto convince investors.  Instead of going to venture capitalists\nwith a business plan and trying to convince them to fund it, you\ncan get a product launched on a few tens of thousands of dollars\nof seed money from us or your uncle, and approach them with a\nworking company instead of a plan for one.  Then instead of\nhaving to seem smooth and confident, you can just point them to\nAlexa.<br/><br/>This way of convincing investors is better suited to hackers, who\noften went into technology in part because they felt uncomfortable\nwith the amount of fakeness required in other fields.<br/><br/><b>6. Startup Hubs Will Persist</b><br/><br/>It might seem that if startups get cheap to start, it will mean the\nend of startup hubs like Silicon Valley.  If all you need to start\na startup is rent money, you should be able to do it anywhere.<br/><br/>This is kind of true and kind of false.  It's true that you can now\n<i>start</i> a startup anywhere.  But you have to do more with a\nstartup than just start it.  You have to make it succeed.  And that\nis more likely to happen in a startup hub.<br/><br/>I've thought a lot about this question, and it seems to me the\nincreasing cheapness of web startups will if anything increase the\nimportance of startup hubs.  The value of startup hubs, like centers\nfor any kind of business, lies in something very old-fashioned:\nface to face meetings.  No technology in the immediate future will\nreplace walking down University Ave and running into a friend who\ntells you how to fix a bug that's been bothering you all weekend,\nor visiting a friend's startup down the street and ending up in a\nconversation with one of their investors.<br/><br/>The question of whether to be in a startup hub is like the question\nof whether to take outside investment.  The question is not whether\nyou <i>need</i> it, but whether it brings any advantage at all.\nBecause anything that brings an advantage will give your competitors\nan advantage over you if they do it and you don't.  So if you hear\nsomeone saying \"we don't need to be in Silicon Valley,\" that use\nof the word \"need\" is a sign they're not even thinking about the\nquestion right.<br/><br/>And while startup hubs are as powerful magnets as ever, the increasing\ncheapness of starting a startup means the particles they're attracting\nare getting lighter.  A startup now can be just a pair of 22 year\nold guys.  A company like that can move much more easily than one\nwith 10 people, half of whom have kids.<br/><br/>We know because we make people move for Y Combinator, and it doesn't\nseem to be a problem. The advantage of being able to work together\nface to face for three months outweighs the inconvenience of moving.\nAsk anyone who's done it.<br/><br/>The mobility of seed-stage startups means that seed funding is a\nnational business.  One of the most common emails we get is from\npeople asking if we can help them set up a local clone of Y Combinator.\nBut this just wouldn't work. Seed funding isn't regional, just as\nbig research universities aren't.<br/><br/>Is seed funding not merely national, but international?  Interesting\nquestion.  There are signs it may be.  We've had an ongoing\nstream of founders from outside the US, and they tend to do\nparticularly well, because they're all people who were so determined\nto succeed that they were willing to move to another country to do\nit.<br/><br/>The more mobile startups get, the harder it would be to start new \nsilicon valleys.  If startups are mobile, the best local talent \nwill go to the real Silicon Valley,\nand all they'll get at the local one will be the people who didn't\nhave the energy to move.<br/><br/>This is not a nationalistic idea, incidentally.  It's cities that\ncompete, not countries.  Atlanta is just as hosed as Munich.<br/><br/><b>7. Better Judgement Needed</b><br/><br/>If the number of startups increases dramatically, then the people\nwhose job is to judge them are going to have to get better at\nit.  I'm thinking particularly of investors and acquirers.  We now\nget on the order of 1000 applications a year.  What are we going\nto do if we get 10,000?<br/><br/>That's actually an alarming idea.  But we'll figure out some kind\nof answer.  We'll have to.  It will probably involve writing some\nsoftware, but fortunately we can do that.<br/><br/>Acquirers will also have to get better at picking winners.   \nThey generally do better than investors, because they pick\nlater, when there's more performance to measure.  But even at the\nmost advanced acquirers, identifying companies to\nbuy is extremely ad hoc, and completing the acquisition often\ninvolves a great deal of unneccessary friction.<br/><br/>I think acquirers may eventually have chief acquisition officers\nwho will both identify good acquisitions and make the deals happen.\nAt the moment those two functions are separate.  Promising new\nstartups are often discovered by developers.  If someone powerful\nenough wants to buy them, the deal is handed over to corp dev guys\nto negotiate.  It would be better if both were combined in\none group, headed by someone with a technical background and some\nvision of what they wanted to accomplish.  Maybe in the future big\ncompanies will have both a VP of Engineering responsible for\ntechnology developed in-house, and a CAO responsible for bringing\ntechnology in from outside.<br/><br/>At the moment, there is no one within big companies who gets in\ntrouble when they buy a startup for $200 million that they could\nhave bought earlier for $20 million.  There should start to be\nsomeone who gets in trouble for that.<br/><br/><b>8. College Will Change</b><br/><br/>If the best hackers start their own companies after college\ninstead of getting jobs, that will change what happens in college.\nMost of these changes will be for the better.  I think the experience\nof college is warped in a bad way by the expectation that afterward\nyou'll be judged by potential employers.<br/><br/>One change will be in the meaning of \"after\ncollege,\" which will switch from when one graduates from college\nto when one leaves it.  If you're starting your own company, why\ndo you need a degree?  We don't encourage people to start startups\nduring college, but the best founders are certainly\ncapable of it.  Some of the most successful companies we've funded\nwere started by undergrads.<br/><br/>I grew up in a time where college degrees seemed really important,\nso I'm alarmed to be saying things like this, but there's nothing\nmagical about a degree.  There's nothing that magically changes\nafter you take that last exam.  The importance of degrees is due\nsolely to the administrative needs of large organizations.  These\ncan certainly affect your life—it's hard to get into grad\nschool, or to get a work visa in the US, without an undergraduate\ndegree—but tests like this will matter less and\nless.<br/><br/>As well as mattering less whether students get degrees, it will\nalso start to matter less where they go to college.  In a startup\nyou're judged by users, and they don't care where you went to\ncollege.  So in a world of startups, elite universities will play\nless of a role as gatekeepers.  In the US it's a national scandal\nhow easily children of rich parents game college admissions.\nBut the way this problem ultimately gets solved may not be by\nreforming the universities but by going around them.  We in the\ntechnology world are used to that sort of solution: you don't beat\nthe incumbents; you redefine the problem to make them irrelevant.<br/><br/>The greatest value of universities is not the brand name or perhaps\neven the classes so much as the people you meet.  If\nit becomes common to start a startup after college, students may start\ntrying to maximize this.  Instead of focusing on getting\ninternships at companies they want to work for, they may start\nto focus on working with other students they want as cofounders.<br/><br/>What students do in their classes will change too.  Instead of\ntrying to get good grades to impress future employers, students\nwill try to learn things.  We're talking about some pretty dramatic\nchanges here.<br/><br/><b>9. Lots of Competitors</b><br/><br/>If it gets easier to start a startup, it's easier for competitors too. \nThat doesn't erase the advantage of\nincreased cheapness, however.  You're not all playing a zero-sum\ngame.  There's not some fixed number of startups that can succeed,\nregardless of how many are started.<br/><br/>In fact, I don't think there's any limit to the number of startups\nthat could succeed.  Startups succeed by creating wealth, which is\nthe satisfaction of people's desires.  And people's desires seem\nto be effectively infinite, at least in the short term.<br/><br/>What the increasing number of startups does mean is that you won't\nbe able to sit on a good idea.  Other people have your idea, and\nthey'll be increasingly likely to do something about it.<br/><br/><b>10. Faster Advances</b><br/><br/>There's a good side to that, at least for consumers of\ntechnology.  If people get right to work implementing ideas instead\nof sitting on them, technology will evolve faster.<br/><br/>Some kinds of innovations happen a company at a time, like the\npunctuated equilibrium model of evolution.  There are some kinds\nof ideas that are so threatening that it's hard for big companies\neven to think of them.  Look at what a hard time Microsoft is\nhaving discovering web apps.  They're like a character in a movie\nthat everyone in the audience can see something bad is about to\nhappen to, but who can't see it himself.  The big innovations\nthat happen a company at a time will obviously happen faster if\nthe rate of new companies increases.<br/><br/>But in fact there will be a double speed increase.  People won't\nwait as long to act on new ideas, but also those ideas will\nincreasingly be developed within startups rather than big companies.\nWhich means technology will evolve faster per company as well.<br/><br/>Big companies are just not a good place to make things happen fast.\nI talked recently to a founder whose startup had been acquired by\na big company.  He was a precise sort of guy, so he'd measured their\nproductivity before and after.  He counted lines of code, which can\nbe a dubious measure, but in this case was meaningful because it\nwas the same group of programmers.  He found they were one thirteenth\nas productive after the acquisition.<br/><br/>The company that bought them was not a particularly stupid one.\nI think what he was measuring was mostly the cost of bigness.  I\nexperienced this myself, and his number sounds about right.  There's\nsomething about big companies that just sucks the energy out of\nyou.<br/><br/>Imagine what all that energy could do if it were put to use.  There\nis an enormous latent capacity in the world's hackers that most\npeople don't even realize is there.  That's the main reason we do\nY Combinator: to let loose all this energy by making it easy for\nhackers to start their own startups.<br/><br/><b>A Series of Tubes</b><br/><br/>The process of starting startups is currently like the plumbing in\nan old house.  The pipes are narrow and twisty, and there are leaks\nin every joint.  In the future this mess will gradually be replaced\nby a single, huge pipe.  The water will still have to get from A\nto B, but it will get there faster and without the risk of spraying\nout through some random leak.<br/><br/>This will change a lot of things for the better.  In a big, straight\npipe like that, the force of being measured by one's performance\nwill propagate back through the whole system.  Performance is always\nthe ultimate test, but there are so many kinks in the plumbing now\nthat most people are insulated from it most of the time.  So you\nend up with a world in which high school students think they need\nto get good grades to get into elite colleges, and college students\nthink they need to get good grades to impress employers, within\nwhich the employees waste most of their time in political battles,\nand from which consumers have to buy anyway because there are so\nfew choices.  Imagine if that sequence became a big, straight pipe.\nThen the effects of being measured by performance would propagate\nall the way back to high school, flushing out all the arbitrary\nstuff people are measured by now.  That is the future of web startups.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Brian Oberkirch and Simon Willison for inviting me to \nspeak, and the crew at Carson Systems for making everything run smoothly.<br/><br/></br></p></font>","date":"2007-10-01T00:00:00Z"}
