Our first batch, in the summer of 2005, had\neight startups in it.  Of those eight, it now looks as if at least\nfour succeeded.  Three have been acquired: \n<a href=\"http://reddit.com\">Reddit</a> was a merger of\ntwo, Reddit and Infogami, and a third was acquired that we can't\ntalk about yet.  Another from that batch was \n<a href=\"http://loopt.com\">Loopt</a>, which is doing\nso well they could probably be acquired in about ten minutes if\nthey wanted to.<br/><br/>So about half the founders from that first summer, less than two\nyears ago, are now rich, at least by their standards.  (One thing\nyou learn when you get rich is that there are many degrees of it.)<br/><br/>I'm not ready to predict our success rate will stay as high as 50%.\nThat first batch could have been an anomaly.  But we should be able\nto do better than the oft-quoted (and probably made\nup) standard figure of 10%.  I'd feel safe aiming at 25%.<br/><br/>Even the founders who fail don't seem to have such a bad time.  Of\nthose first eight startups, three are now probably dead.  In two\ncases the founders just went on to do other things at the end of\nthe summer.   I don't think they were traumatized by the experience.\nThe closest to a traumatic failure was Kiko, whose founders kept\nworking on their startup for a whole year before being squashed by\nGoogle Calendar.  But they ended up happy.  They sold their software\non eBay for a quarter of a million dollars.  After they paid back\ntheir angel investors, they had about a year's salary each.  \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f1n\"><font color=\"#777777\">1</font></a>]</font>\nThen they immediately went on to start a new and much more exciting\nstartup, <a href=\"http://justin.tv\">Justin.TV</a>.<br/><br/>So here is an even more striking statistic: 0% of that first batch\nhad a terrible experience.  They had ups and downs, like every\nstartup, but I don't think any would have traded it for a job in a\ncubicle.  And that statistic is probably not an anomaly.  Whatever\nour long-term success rate ends up being, I think the rate of people\nwho wish they'd gotten a regular job will stay close to 0%.<br/><br/>The big mystery to me is: why don't more people start startups?  If\nnearly everyone who does it prefers it to a regular job, and a\nsignificant percentage get rich, why doesn't everyone want to do\nthis?  A lot of people think we get thousands of applications for\neach funding cycle.  In fact we usually only get several hundred.\nWhy don't more people apply?  And while it must seem to anyone\nwatching this world that startups are popping up like crazy, the\nnumber is small compared to the number of people with the necessary\nskills.  The great majority of programmers still go straight from\ncollege to cubicle, and stay there.<br/><br/>It seems like people are not acting in their own interest.  What's\ngoing on?   Well, I can answer that.  Because of Y Combinator's\nposition at the very start of the venture funding process, we're\nprobably the world's leading experts on the psychology of people\nwho aren't sure if they want to start a company.<br/><br/>There's nothing wrong with being unsure.  If you're a hacker thinking\nabout starting a startup and hesitating before taking the leap,\nyou're part of a grand tradition.  Larry and Sergey seem to have\nfelt the same before they started Google, and so did Jerry and Filo\nbefore they started Yahoo.  In fact, I'd guess the most successful\nstartups are the ones started by uncertain hackers rather than\ngung-ho business guys.<br/><br/>We have some evidence to support this.  Several of the most successful\nstartups we've funded told us later that they only decided to apply\nat the last moment.  Some decided only hours before the deadline.<br/><br/>The way to deal with uncertainty is to analyze it into components.\nMost people who are reluctant to do something have about eight\ndifferent reasons mixed together in their heads, and don't know\nthemselves which are biggest.  Some will be justified and some\nbogus, but unless you know the relative proportion of each, you\ndon't know whether your overall uncertainty is mostly justified or\nmostly bogus.<br/><br/>So I'm going to list all the components of people's reluctance to\nstart startups, and explain which are real.  Then would-be founders\ncan use this as a checklist to examine their own feelings.<br/><br/>I admit my goal is to increase your self-confidence.  But there are\ntwo things different here from the usual confidence-building exercise.\nOne is that I'm motivated to be honest.  Most people in the\nconfidence-building business have already achieved their goal when\nyou buy the book or pay to attend the seminar where they tell you\nhow great you are.  Whereas if I encourage people to start startups\nwho shouldn't, I make my own life worse.  If I encourage too many\npeople to apply to Y Combinator, it just means more work for me,\nbecause I have to read all the applications.<br/><br/>The other thing that's going to be different is my approach.  Instead\nof being positive, I'm going to be negative.  Instead of telling\nyou \"come on, you can do it\" I'm going to consider all the reasons\nyou aren't doing it, and show why most (but not all) should be\nignored.  We'll start with the one everyone's born with.<br/><br/><b>1. Too young</b><br/><br/>A lot of people think they're too young to start a startup.  Many\nare right.  The median age worldwide is about 27, so probably a\nthird of the population can truthfully say they're too young.<br/><br/>What's too young?  One of our goals with Y Combinator was to discover\nthe lower bound on the age of startup founders.  It always seemed\nto us that investors were too conservative hereâ€”that they wanted\nto fund professors, when really they should be funding grad students\nor even undergrads.<br/><br/>The main thing we've discovered from pushing the edge of this\nenvelope is not where the edge is, but how fuzzy it is.  The outer\nlimit may be as low as 16.  We don't look beyond 18 because people\nyounger than that can't legally enter into contracts.  But the most\nsuccessful founder we've funded so far, Sam Altman, was 19 at the\ntime.<br/><br/>Sam Altman, however, is an outlying data point.  When he was 19,\nhe seemed like he had a 40 year old inside him.  There are other\n19 year olds who are 12 inside.<br/><br/>There's a reason we have a distinct word \"adult\" for people over a\ncertain age.  There is a threshold you cross.  It's conventionally\nfixed at 21, but different people cross it at greatly varying ages.\nYou're old enough to start a startup if you've crossed this threshold,\nwhatever your age.<br/><br/>How do you tell?  There are a couple tests adults use.  I realized\nthese tests existed after meeting Sam Altman, actually.  I noticed\nthat I felt like I was talking to someone much older.  Afterward I\nwondered, what am I even measuring?  What made him seem older?<br/><br/>One test adults use is whether you still have the kid flake reflex.\nWhen you're a little kid and you're asked to do something hard, you\ncan cry and say \"I can't do it\" and the adults will probably let\nyou off.  As a kid there's a magic button you can press by saying\n\"I'm just a kid\" that will get you out of most difficult situations.\nWhereas adults, by definition, are not allowed to flake.  They still\ndo, of course, but when they do they're ruthlessly pruned.<br/><br/>The other way to tell an adult is by how they react to a challenge.\nSomeone who's not yet an adult will tend to respond to a challenge\nfrom an adult in a way that acknowledges their dominance.  If an\nadult says \"that's a stupid idea,\" a kid will either crawl away\nwith his tail between his legs, or rebel.  But rebelling presumes\ninferiority as much as submission.  The adult response to\n\"that's a stupid idea,\" is simply to look the other person in the\neye and say \"Really?  Why do you think so?\"<br/><br/>There are a lot of adults who still react childishly to challenges,\nof course.  What you don't often find are kids who react to challenges\nlike adults.  When you do, you've found an adult, whatever their\nage.<br/><br/><b>2. Too inexperienced</b><br/><br/>I once wrote that startup founders should be at least 23, and that\npeople should work for another company for a few years before\nstarting their own.  I no longer believe that, and what changed my\nmind is the example of the startups we've funded.<br/><br/>I still think 23 is a better age than 21.  But the best way to get\nexperience if you're 21 is to start a startup.  So, paradoxically,\nif you're too inexperienced to start a startup, what you should do\nis start one.  That's a way more efficient cure for inexperience\nthan a normal job.  In fact, getting a normal job may actually make\nyou less able to start a startup, by turning you into a tame animal\nwho thinks he needs an office to work in and a product manager to\ntell him what software to write.<br/><br/>What really convinced me of this was the Kikos.  They started a\nstartup right out of college.  Their inexperience caused them to\nmake a lot of mistakes.  But by the time we funded their second\nstartup, a year later, they had become extremely formidable.  They\nwere certainly not tame animals.  And there is no way they'd have\ngrown so much if they'd spent that year working at Microsoft, or\neven Google.  They'd still have been diffident junior programmers.<br/><br/>So now I'd advise people to go ahead and start startups right out\nof college.  There's no better time to take risks than when you're\nyoung.  Sure, you'll probably fail.  But even failure will get you\nto the ultimate goal faster than getting a job.<br/><br/>It worries me a bit to be saying this, because in effect we're\nadvising people to educate themselves by failing at our expense,\nbut it's the truth.<br/><br/><b>3. Not determined enough</b><br/><br/>You need a lot of determination to succeed as a startup founder.\nIt's probably the single best predictor of success.<br/><br/>Some people may not be determined enough to make it.  It's\nhard for me to say for sure, because I'm so determined that I can't\nimagine what's going on in the heads of people who aren't.  But I\nknow they exist.<br/><br/>Most hackers probably underestimate their determination.  I've seen\na lot become visibly more determined as they get used to running a \nstartup.  I can think of\nseveral we've funded who would have been delighted at first to be\nbought for $2 million, but are now set on world domination.<br/><br/>How can you tell if you're determined enough, when Larry and Sergey\nthemselves were unsure at first about starting a company?  I'm\nguessing here, but I'd say the test is whether you're sufficiently\ndriven to work on your own projects.  Though they may have been\nunsure whether they wanted to start a company, it doesn't seem as\nif Larry and Sergey were meek little research assistants, obediently\ndoing their advisors' bidding.  They started projects of their own.<br/><br/>\n<b>4. Not smart enough</b><br/><br/>You may need to be moderately smart to succeed as a startup founder.\nBut if you're worried about this, you're probably mistaken.  If\nyou're smart enough to worry that you might not be smart enough to\nstart a startup, you probably are.<br/><br/>And in any case, starting a startup just doesn't require that much\nintelligence.  Some startups do.  You have to be good at math to\nwrite Mathematica.  But most companies do more mundane stuff where\nthe decisive factor is effort, not brains.  Silicon Valley can warp\nyour perspective on this, because there's a cult of smartness here.\nPeople who aren't smart at least try to act that way.  But if you\nthink it takes a lot of intelligence to get rich, try spending a\ncouple days in some of the fancier bits of New York or LA.<br/><br/>If you don't think you're smart enough to start a startup doing\nsomething technically difficult, just write enterprise software.\nEnterprise software companies aren't technology companies, they're\nsales companies, and sales depends mostly on effort.<br/><br/><b>5. Know nothing about business</b><br/><br/>This is another variable whose coefficient should be zero.  You\ndon't need to know anything about business to start a startup.  The\ninitial focus should be the product.  All you need to know in this\nphase is how to build things people want.  If you succeed, you'll\nhave to think about how to make money from it.  But this is so easy\nyou can pick it up on the fly.<br/><br/>I get a fair amount of flak for telling founders just to make\nsomething great and not worry too much about making money.  And yet\nall the empirical evidence points that way: pretty much 100% of\nstartups that make something popular manage to make money from it.\nAnd acquirers tell me privately that revenue is not what they buy\nstartups for, but their strategic value.  Which means, because they\nmade something people want.  Acquirers know the rule holds for them\ntoo: if users love you, you can always make money from that somehow,\nand if they don't, the cleverest business model in the world won't\nsave you.<br/><br/>So why do so many people argue with me?  I think one reason is that\nthey hate the idea that a bunch of twenty year olds could get rich\nfrom building something cool that doesn't make any money.  They\njust don't want that to be possible.  But how possible it is doesn't\ndepend on how much they want it to be.<br/><br/>For a while it annoyed me to hear myself described as some kind of\nirresponsible pied piper, leading impressionable young hackers down\nthe road to ruin.  But now I realize this kind of controversy is a\nsign of a good idea.<br/><br/>The most valuable truths are the ones most people don't believe.\nThey're like undervalued stocks.  If you start with them, you'll\nhave the whole field to yourself.  So when you find an idea you\nknow is good but most people disagree with, you should not\nmerely ignore their objections, but push aggressively in that\ndirection.  In this case, that means you should seek out ideas that\nwould be popular but seem hard to make money from.<br/><br/>We'll bet a seed round you can't make something popular that we\ncan't figure out how to make money from.<br/><br/><b>6. No cofounder</b><br/><br/>Not having a cofounder is a real problem.  A startup is too much\nfor one person to bear.  And though we differ from other investors\non a lot of questions, we all agree on this.  All investors, without\nexception, are more likely to fund you with a cofounder than without.<br/><br/>We've funded two single founders, but in both cases we suggested\ntheir first priority should be to find a cofounder.  Both did.  But\nwe'd have preferred them to have cofounders before they applied.\nIt's not super hard to get a cofounder for a project that's just\nbeen funded, and we'd rather have cofounders committed enough to\nsign up for something super hard.<br/><br/>If you don't have a cofounder, what should you do?  Get one.  It's\nmore important than anything else.  If there's no one where you\nlive who wants to start a startup with you, move where there are\npeople who do.  If no one wants to work with you on your current\nidea, switch to an idea people want to work on.<br/><br/>If you're still in school, you're surrounded by potential cofounders.\nA few years out it gets harder to find them.  Not only do you have\na smaller pool to draw from, but most already have jobs, and perhaps\neven families to support.  So if you had friends in college you\nused to scheme about startups with, stay in touch with them as well\nas you can.  That may help keep the dream alive.<br/><br/>It's possible you could meet a cofounder through something like a\nuser's group or a conference.  But I wouldn't be too optimistic.\nYou need to work with someone to know whether you want them as a\ncofounder.  \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f2n\"><font color=\"#777777\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The real lesson to draw from this is not how to find a cofounder,\nbut that you should start startups when you're young and there are\nlots of them around.<br/><br/><b>7. No idea</b><br/><br/>In a sense, it's not a problem if you don't have a good idea, because\nmost startups change their idea anyway.  In the average Y Combinator\nstartup, I'd guess 70% of the idea is new at the end of the\nfirst three months.  Sometimes it's 100%.<br/><br/>In fact, we're so sure the founders are more important than the\ninitial idea that we're going to try something new this funding\ncycle. We're going to let people apply with no idea at all.  If you\nwant, you can answer the question on the application form that asks\nwhat you're going to do with \"We have no idea.\"  If you seem really\ngood we'll accept you anyway.  We're confident we can sit down with\nyou and cook up some promising project.<br/><br/>Really this just codifies what we do already.  We put little weight\non the idea.  We ask mainly out of politeness.  The kind of question\non the application form that we really care about is the one where\nwe ask what cool things you've made.  If what you've made is version\none of a promising startup, so much the better, but the main thing\nwe care about is whether you're good at making things.  Being lead\ndeveloper of a popular open source project counts almost as much.<br/><br/>That solves the problem if you get funded by Y Combinator.  What\nabout in the general case?  Because in another sense, it is a problem\nif you don't have an idea.  If you start a startup with no idea,\nwhat do you do next?<br/><br/>So here's the brief recipe for getting startup ideas.  Find something\nthat's missing in your own life, and supply that needâ€”no matter\nhow specific to you it seems.  Steve Wozniak built himself a computer;\nwho knew so many other people would want them?  A need that's narrow\nbut genuine is a better starting point than one that's broad but\nhypothetical.  So even if the problem is simply that you don't have\na date on Saturday night, if you can think of a way to fix that by\nwriting software, you're onto something, because a lot of other\npeople have the same problem.<br/><br/><b>8. No room for more startups</b><br/><br/>A lot of people look at the ever-increasing number of startups and\nthink \"this can't continue.\"  Implicit in their thinking is a\nfallacy: that there is some limit on the number of startups there\ncould be.  But this is false.  No one claims there's any limit on\nthe number of people who can work for salary at 1000-person companies.\nWhy should there be any limit on the number who can work for equity\nat 5-person companies? \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f3n\"><font color=\"#777777\">3</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Nearly everyone who works is satisfying some kind of need.  Breaking\nup companies into smaller units doesn't make those needs go away.\nExisting needs would probably get satisfied more efficiently by a\nnetwork of startups than by a few giant, hierarchical organizations,\nbut I don't think that would mean less opportunity, because satisfying\ncurrent needs would lead to more.  Certainly this tends to be the\ncase in individuals.  Nor is there anything wrong with that.  We\ntake for granted things that medieval kings would have considered\neffeminate luxuries, like whole buildings heated to spring temperatures\nyear round.  And if things go well, our descendants will take for\ngranted things we would consider shockingly luxurious.  There is\nno absolute standard for material wealth.  Health care is a component\nof it, and that alone is a black hole.  For the foreseeable future,\npeople will want ever more material wealth, so there is no limit\nto the amount of work available for companies, and for startups in\nparticular.<br/><br/>Usually the limited-room fallacy is not expressed directly.  Usually\nit's implicit in statements like \"there are only so many startups\nGoogle, Microsoft, and Yahoo can buy.\"  Maybe, though the list of\nacquirers is a lot longer than that.  And whatever you think of\nother acquirers, Google is not stupid.  The reason big companies\nbuy startups is that they've created something valuable.  And why\nshould there be any limit to the number of valuable startups companies\ncan acquire, any more than there is a limit to the amount of wealth\nindividual people want?  Maybe there would be practical limits on\nthe number of startups any one acquirer could assimilate, but if\nthere is value to be had, in the form of upside that founders are\nwilling to forgo in return for an immediate payment, acquirers will\nevolve to consume it.  Markets are pretty smart that way.<br/><br/><b>9. Family to support</b><br/><br/>This one is real.  I wouldn't advise anyone with a family to start\na startup.  I'm not saying it's a bad idea, just that I don't want\nto take responsibility for advising it.  I'm willing to take\nresponsibility for telling 22 year olds to start startups.  So what\nif they fail?  They'll learn a lot, and that job at Microsoft will\nstill be waiting for them if they need it.  But I'm not prepared\nto cross moms.<br/><br/>What you can do, if you have a family and want to start a startup,\nis start a consulting business you can then gradually turn into a\nproduct business.  Empirically the chances of pulling that off seem\nvery small. You're never going to produce Google this way.  But at\nleast you'll never be without an income.<br/><br/>Another way to decrease the risk is to join an existing startup\ninstead of starting your own.  Being one of the first employees of\na startup is a lot like being a founder, in both the good ways and\nthe bad.  You'll be roughly 1/n^2 founder, where n is your employee\nnumber.<br/><br/>As with the question of cofounders, the real lesson here is to start\nstartups when you're young.<br/><br/><b>10. Independently wealthy</b><br/><br/>This is my excuse for not starting a startup.  Startups are stressful.\nWhy do it if you don't need the money?  For every \"serial entrepreneur,\"\nthere are probably twenty sane ones who think \"Start another\ncompany?  Are you crazy?\"<br/><br/>I've come close to starting new startups a couple times, but I\nalways pull back because I don't want four years of my life to be\nconsumed by random schleps.  I know this business well enough to\nknow you can't do it half-heartedly.  What makes a good startup\nfounder so dangerous is his willingness to endure infinite schleps.<br/><br/>There is a bit of a problem with retirement, though.  Like a lot\nof people, I like to work.  And one of the many weird little problems\nyou discover when you get rich is that a lot of the interesting\npeople you'd like to work with are not rich.  They need to work at\nsomething that pays the bills.  Which means if you want to have\nthem as colleagues, you have to work at something that pays the\nbills too, even though you don't need to.  I think this is what\ndrives a lot of serial entrepreneurs, actually.<br/><br/>That's why I love working on Y Combinator so much.  It's an excuse\nto work on something interesting with people I like.<br/><br/><b>11.  Not ready for commitment</b><br/><br/>This was my reason for not starting a startup for most of my twenties.\nLike a lot of people that age, I valued freedom most of all.  I was\nreluctant to do anything that required a commitment of more than a\nfew months.  Nor would I have wanted to do anything that completely\ntook over my life the way a startup does.  And that's fine.  If you\nwant to spend your time travelling around, or playing in a band,\nor whatever, that's a perfectly legitimate reason not to start a\ncompany.<br/><br/>If you start a startup that succeeds, it's going to consume at least\nthree or four years.  (If it fails, you'll be done a lot quicker.)\nSo you shouldn't do it if you're not ready for commitments on that\nscale.  Be aware, though, that if you get a regular job, you'll\nprobably end up working there for as long as a startup would take,\nand you'll find you have much less spare time than you might expect.\nSo if you're ready to clip on that ID badge and go to that orientation\nsession, you may also be ready to start that startup.<br/><br/><b>12.  Need for structure</b><br/><br/>I'm told there are people who need structure in their lives.  This\nseems to be a nice way of saying they need someone to tell them\nwhat to do.  I believe such people exist.  There's plenty of empirical\nevidence: armies, religious cults, and so on.  They may even be the\nmajority.<br/><br/>If you're one of these people, you probably shouldn't start a\nstartup.  In fact, you probably shouldn't even go to work for one.\nIn a good startup, you don't get told what to do very much.  There\nmay be one person whose job title is CEO, but till the company has\nabout twelve people no one should be telling anyone what to do.\nThat's too inefficient.  Each person should just do what they need\nto without anyone telling them.<br/><br/>If that sounds like a recipe for chaos, think about a soccer team.\nEleven people manage to work together in quite complicated ways,\nand yet only in occasional emergencies does anyone tell anyone else\nwhat to do.  A reporter once asked David Beckham if there were any\nlanguage problems at Real Madrid, since the players were from about\neight different countries.  He said it was never an issue, because\neveryone was so good they never had to talk.  They all just did the\nright thing.<br/><br/>How do you tell if you're independent-minded enough to start a\nstartup?  If you'd bristle at the suggestion that you aren't, then\nyou probably are.<br/><br/><b>13. Fear of uncertainty</b><br/><br/>Perhaps some people are deterred from starting startups because\nthey don't like the uncertainty.  If you go to work for Microsoft,\nyou can predict fairly accurately what the next few years will be\nlikeâ€”all too accurately, in fact.  If you start a startup, anything\nmight happen.<br/><br/>Well, if you're troubled by uncertainty, I can solve that problem\nfor you: if you start a startup, it will probably fail.  Seriously, \nthough, this is not a bad way to think\nabout the whole experience.  Hope for the best, but expect the\nworst.  In the worst case, it will at least be interesting.  In the\nbest case you might get rich.<br/><br/>No one will blame you if the startup tanks, so long as you made a\nserious effort.  There may once have been a time when employers\nwould regard that as a mark against you, but they wouldn't now.  I\nasked managers at big companies, and they all said they'd prefer\nto hire someone who'd tried to start a startup and failed over\nsomeone who'd spent the same time working at a big company.<br/><br/>Nor will investors hold it against you, as long as you didn't fail\nout of laziness or incurable stupidity.   I'm told there's a lot\nof stigma attached to failing in other placesâ€”in Europe, for\nexample.  Not here.  In America, companies, like practically\neverything else, are disposable.<br/><br/><b>14. Don't realize what you're avoiding</b><br/><br/>One reason people who've been out in the world for a year or two\nmake better founders than people straight from college is that they\nknow what they're avoiding.  If their startup fails, they'll have\nto get a job, and they know how much jobs suck.<br/><br/>If you've had summer jobs in college, you may think you know what\njobs are like, but you probably don't.  Summer jobs at technology\ncompanies are not real jobs.  If you get a summer job as a waiter,\nthat's a real job.  Then you have to carry your weight.  But software\ncompanies don't hire students for the summer as a source of cheap\nlabor.  They do it in the hope of recruiting them when they graduate.\nSo while they're happy if you produce, they don't expect you to.<br/><br/>That will change if you get a real job after you graduate.  Then\nyou'll have to earn your keep.  And since most of what big companies\ndo is boring, you're going to have to work on boring stuff.  Easy,\ncompared to college, but boring.  At first it may seem cool to get\npaid for doing easy stuff, after paying to do hard stuff in college.\nBut that wears off after a few months.  Eventually it gets demoralizing\nto work on dumb stuff, even if it's easy and you get paid a lot.<br/><br/>And that's not the worst of it.  The thing that really sucks about\nhaving a regular job is the expectation that you're supposed to be\nthere at certain times.  Even Google is afflicted with this,\napparently.  And what this means, as everyone who's had a regular\njob can tell you, is that there are going to be times when you have\nabsolutely no desire to work on anything, and you're going to have\nto go to work anyway and sit in front of your screen and pretend\nto.  To someone who likes work, as most good hackers do, this is\ntorture.<br/><br/>In a startup, you skip all that.  There's no concept of office hours\nin most startups.  Work and life just get mixed together.  But the\ngood thing about that is that no one minds if you have a life at\nwork.  In a startup you can do whatever you want most of the time.\nIf you're a founder, what you want to do most of the time is work.\nBut you never have to pretend to.<br/><br/>If you took a nap in your office in a big company, it would seem\nunprofessional.  But if you're starting a startup and you fall\nasleep in the middle of the day, your cofounders will just assume\nyou were tired.<br/><br/><b>15. Parents want you to be a doctor</b><br/><br/>A significant number of would-be startup founders are probably\ndissuaded from doing it by their parents.  I'm not going to say you\nshouldn't listen to them.  Families are entitled to their own\ntraditions, and who am I to argue with them?  But I will give you\na couple reasons why a safe career might not be what your parents\nreally want for you.<br/><br/>One is that parents tend to be more conservative for their kids\nthan they would be for themselves.  This is actually a rational\nresponse to their situation.  Parents end up sharing more of their\nkids' ill fortune than good fortune.  Most parents don't mind this;\nit's part of the job; but it does tend to make them excessively\nconservative.  And erring on the side of conservatism is still\nerring.  In almost everything, reward is proportionate to risk.  So\nby protecting their kids from risk, parents are, without realizing\nit, also protecting them from rewards.  If they saw that, they'd\nwant you to take more risks.<br/><br/>The other reason parents may be mistaken is that, like generals,\nthey're always fighting the last war.  If they want you to be a\ndoctor, odds are it's not just because they want you to help the\nsick, but also because it's a prestigious and lucrative career.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f4n\"><font color=\"#777777\">4</font></a>]</font>\nBut not so lucrative or prestigious as it was when their\nopinions were formed.  When I was a kid in the seventies, a doctor\nwas <i>the</i> thing to be.  There was a sort of golden triangle involving\ndoctors, Mercedes 450SLs, and tennis.  All three vertices now seem\npretty dated.<br/><br/>The parents who want you to be a doctor may simply not realize how\nmuch things have changed.  Would they be that unhappy if you were\nSteve Jobs instead?  So I think the way to deal with your parents'\nopinions about what you should do is to treat them like feature\nrequests.  Even if your only goal is to please them, the way to do\nthat is not simply to give them what they ask for.  Instead think\nabout why they're asking for something, and see if there's a better\nway to give them what they need.<br/><br/><b>16.  A job is the default</b><br/><br/>This leads us to the last and probably most powerful reason people\nget regular jobs: it's the default thing to do.  Defaults are\nenormously powerful, precisely because they operate without any\nconscious choice.<br/><br/>To almost everyone except criminals, it seems an axiom that if you\nneed money, you should get a job.  Actually this tradition is not\nmuch more than a hundred years old.  Before that, the default way\nto make a living was by farming.  It's a bad plan to treat something\nonly a hundred years old as an axiom.  By historical standards,\nthat's something that's changing pretty rapidly.<br/><br/>We may be seeing another such change right now.  I've read a lot\nof economic history, and I understand the startup world pretty well,\nand it now seems to me fairly likely that we're seeing the beginning\nof a change like the one from farming to manufacturing.<br/><br/>And you know what?  If you'd been around when that change began\n(around 1000 in Europe) it would have seemed to nearly everyone\nthat running off to the city to make your fortune was a crazy thing\nto do.  Though serfs were in principle forbidden to leave their\nmanors, it can't have been that hard to run away to a city.  There\nwere no guards patrolling the perimeter of the village.  What\nprevented most serfs from leaving was that it seemed insanely risky.\nLeave one's plot of land?  Leave the people you'd spent your whole\nlife with, to live in a giant city of three or four thousand complete\nstrangers?  How would you live?  How would you get food, if you\ndidn't grow it?<br/><br/>Frightening as it seemed to them, it's now the default with us to\nlive by our wits.  So if it seems risky to you to start a startup,\nthink how risky it once seemed to your ancestors to live as we do\nnow.  Oddly enough, the people who know this best are the very ones\ntrying to get you to stick to the old model.  How can Larry and\nSergey say you should come work as their employee, when they didn't\nget jobs themselves?<br/><br/>Now we look back on medieval peasants and wonder how they stood it.\nHow grim it must have been to till the same fields your whole life\nwith no hope of anything better, under the thumb of lords and priests\nyou had to give all your surplus to and acknowledge as your masters.\nI wouldn't be surprised if one day people look back on what we\nconsider a normal job in the same way.  How grim it would be to\ncommute every day to a cubicle in some soulless office complex, and\nbe told what to do by someone you had to acknowledge as a bossâ€”someone \nwho could call you into their office and say \"take a seat,\"\nand you'd sit!  Imagine having to ask <i>permission</i> to release\nsoftware to users.  Imagine being sad on Sunday afternoons because\nthe weekend was almost over, and tomorrow you'd have to get up and\ngo to work.  How did they stand it?<br/><br/>It's exciting to think we may be on the cusp of another shift like\nthe one from farming to manufacturing.  That's why I care about\nstartups.  Startups aren't interesting just because they're a way\nto make a lot of money.  I couldn't care less about other ways to\ndo that, like speculating in securities.  At most those are interesting\nthe way puzzles are.  There's more going on with startups.  They\nmay represent one of those rare, historic shifts in the way \n<a href=\"wealth.html\">wealth</a> is created.<br/><br/>That's ultimately what drives us to work on Y Combinator.  We want\nto make money, if only so we don't have to stop doing it, but that's\nnot the main goal.  There have only been a handful of these great\neconomic shifts in human history.  It would be an amazing hack to\nmake one happen faster.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nThe only people who lost were us.
