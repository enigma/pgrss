{"href":"mean.html","title":"Mean People Fail","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">November 2014<br/><br/>It struck me recently how few of the most successful people I know\nare mean.  There are exceptions, but remarkably few.<br/><br/>Meanness isn't rare.  In fact, one of the things the internet has\nshown us is how mean people can be.  A few decades ago, only famous\npeople and professional writers got to publish their opinions.  Now\neveryone can, and we can all see the <xa href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpOEO2gUekE\">long tail of\nmeanness that had previously been hidden.<br/><br/>And yet while there are clearly a lot of mean people out there,\nthere are next to none among the most successful people I know.\nWhat's going on here?  Are meanness and success inversely correlated?<br/><br/>Part of what's going on, of course, is selection bias.  I only know\npeople who work in certain fields: startup founders, programmers,\nprofessors. I'm willing to believe that successful people in other\nfields are mean.  Maybe successful hedge fund managers are mean; I\ndon't know enough to say.  It seems quite likely that most successful\ndrug lords are mean.  But there are at least big chunks of the world\nthat mean people don't rule, and that territory seems to be growing.<br/><br/>My wife and Y Combinator cofounder Jessica is one of those rare\npeople who have x-ray vision for character. Being married to her\nis like standing next to an airport baggage scanner. She came to\nthe startup world from investment banking, and she has always been\nstruck both by how consistently successful startup founders turn\nout to be good people, and how consistently bad people fail as\nstartup founders.<br/><br/>Why?  I think there are several reasons.  One is that being mean\nmakes you stupid. That's why I hate fights. You never do your best\nwork in a fight, because fights are not sufficiently general.\nWinning is always a function of the situation and the people involved.\nYou don't win fights by thinking of big ideas but by thinking of\ntricks that work in one particular case.  And yet fighting is just\nas much work as thinking about real problems. Which is particularly\npainful to someone who cares how their brain is used: your brain\ngoes fast but you get nowhere, like a car spinning its wheels.<br/><br/>Startups don't win by attacking. They win by transcending. There\nare exceptions of course, but usually the way to win is to race\nahead, not to stop and fight.<br/><br/>Another reason mean founders lose is that they can't get the best\npeople to work for them. They can hire people who will put up with\nthem because they need a job. But the best people have other options.\nA mean person can't convince the best people to work for him unless\nhe is super convincing. And while having the best people helps any\norganization, it's critical for startups.<br/><br/>There is also a complementary force at work: if you want to build\ngreat things, it helps to be driven by a spirit of <xa href=\"good.html\">benevolence. The startup founders who end up\nrichest are not the ones driven by money.  The ones driven by money\ntake the big acquisition offer that nearly every successful startup\ngets en route.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f1n\"><font color=\"#999999\">1</font></a>]</font>\nThe ones who keep going are driven by something\nelse. They may not say so explicitly, but they're usually trying\nto improve the world.  Which means people with a desire to improve\nthe world have a natural advantage.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f2n\"><font color=\"#999999\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The exciting thing is that startups are not just one random type\nof work in which meanness and success are inversely correlated.\nThis kind of work is the future.<br/><br/>For most of history success meant control of scarce resources.  One\ngot that by fighting, whether literally in the case of pastoral\nnomads driving hunter-gatherers into marginal lands, or metaphorically\nin the case of Gilded Age financiers contending with one another\nto assemble railroad monopolies. For most of history, success meant\nsuccess at zero-sum games. And in most of them meanness was not a\nhandicap but probably an advantage.<br/><br/>That is changing. Increasingly the games that matter are not zero-sum.\nIncreasingly you win not by fighting to get control of a scarce\nresource, but by having new ideas and building new things.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f3n\"><font color=\"#999999\">3</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>There have long been games where you won by having new ideas. In\nthe third century BC, Archimedes won by doing that. At least until\nan invading Roman army killed him. Which illustrates why\nthis change is happening: for new ideas to matter, you need a certain\ndegree of civil order.  And not just not being at war.  You also\nneed to prevent the sort of economic violence that nineteenth century\nmagnates practiced against one another and communist countries\npracticed against their citizens.  People need to feel that what\nthey create can't be stolen.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f4n\"><font color=\"#999999\">4</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>That has always been the case for thinkers, which is why this trend\nbegan with them.  When you think of successful people from history\nwho weren't ruthless, you get mathematicians and writers and artists.\nThe exciting thing is that their m.o. seems to be spreading.  The\ngames played by intellectuals are leaking into the real world, and\nthis is reversing the historical polarity of the relationship between\nmeanness and success.<br/><br/>So I'm really glad I stopped to think about this. Jessica and I\nhave always worked hard to teach our kids not to be mean.  We\ntolerate noise and mess and junk food, but not meanness.  And now\nI have both an additional reason to crack down on it, and an\nadditional argument to use when I do: that being mean makes you\nfail.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nI'm not saying all founders who take big acquisition offers\nare driven only by money, but rather that those who don't aren't.\nPlus one can have benevolent motives for being driven by money â€” for \nexample, to take care of one's family, or to be free to work\non projects that improve the world.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nIt's unlikely that every successful startup improves the\nworld.  But their founders, like parents, truly believe they do.\nSuccessful founders are in love with their companies.  And while\nthis sort of love is as blind as the love people have for one\nanother, it is genuine.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\n<a href=\"http://startupclass.samaltman.com/courses/lec05\">Peter \nThiel</a> would point out that successful founders still\nget rich from controlling monopolies, just monopolies they create\nrather than ones they capture.  And while this is largely true, it\nmeans a big change in the sort of person who wins.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f4n\"><font color=\"#000000\">4</font></a>]\nTo be fair, the Romans didn't mean to kill Archimedes.  The\nRoman commander specifically ordered that he be spared. But he got\nkilled in the chaos anyway.<br/><br/>In sufficiently disordered times, even thinking requires\ncontrol of scarce resources, because living at all is a scarce\nresource.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Ron Conway, Daniel Gackle, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris,\nGeoff Ralston, and Fred Wilson for reading drafts of this.<br/><br/></xa></xa></font>","date":"2014-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
