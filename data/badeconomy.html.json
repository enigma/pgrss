I'm not claiming it's a particularly good time\neither.  The truth is more boring: the state of the economy doesn't\nmatter much either way.<br/><br/>If we've learned one thing from funding so many startups, it's that\nthey succeed or fail based on the qualities of the founders.  The\neconomy has some effect, certainly, but as a predictor of success\nit's rounding error compared to the founders.<br/><br/>Which means that what matters is who you are, not when you do it.\nIf you're the right sort of person, you'll win even in a bad economy.\nAnd if you're not, a good economy won't save you.  Someone who\nthinks \"I better not start a startup now, because the economy is\nso bad\" is making the same mistake as the people who thought during\nthe Bubble \"all I have to do is start a startup, and I'll be rich.\"<br/><br/>So if you want to improve your chances, you should think far more\nabout who you can recruit as a cofounder than the state of the\neconomy.  And if you're worried about threats to the survival of\nyour company, don't look for them in the news.  Look in the mirror.<br/><br/>But for any given team of founders, would it not pay to wait till\nthe economy is better before taking the leap?  If you're starting\na restaurant, maybe, but not if you're working on technology.\nTechnology progresses more or less independently of the stock market.\nSo for any given idea, the payoff for acting fast in a bad economy\nwill be higher than for waiting.  Microsoft's first product was a\nBasic interpreter for the Altair.  That was exactly what the world\nneeded in 1975, but if Gates and Allen had decided to wait a few\nyears, it would have been too late.<br/><br/>Of course, the idea you have now won't be the last you have.  There\nare always new ideas.  But if you have a specific idea you want to\nact on, act now.<br/><br/>That doesn't mean you can ignore the economy.  Both customers and investors\nwill be feeling pinched.  It's not necessarily a problem if customers\nfeel pinched: you may even be able to benefit from it, by making\nthings that <a href=\"http://bountii.com\">save money</a>.  \nStartups often make things cheaper, so in\nthat respect they're better positioned to prosper in a recession\nthan big companies.<br/><br/>Investors are more of a problem.  Startups generally need to raise\nsome amount of external funding, and investors tend to be less\nwilling to invest in bad times.  They shouldn't be.  Everyone knows\nyou're supposed to buy when times are bad and sell when times are\ngood.  But of course what makes investing so counterintuitive is\nthat in equity markets, good times are defined as everyone thinking\nit's time to buy.  You have to be a contrarian to be correct, and\nby definition only a minority of investors can be.<br/><br/>So just as investors in 1999 were tripping over one another trying\nto buy into lousy startups, investors in 2009 will presumably be\nreluctant to invest even in good ones.<br/><br/>You'll have to adapt to this.  But that's nothing new: startups\nalways have to adapt to the whims of investors.  Ask any founder\nin any economy if they'd describe investors as fickle, and watch\nthe face they make.  Last year you had to be prepared to explain\nhow your startup was viral.  Next year you'll have to explain how\nit's recession-proof.<br/><br/>(Those are both good things to be.  The mistake investors make is\nnot the criteria they use but that they always tend to focus on one\nto the exclusion of the rest.)<br/><br/>Fortunately the way to make a startup recession-proof is to do\nexactly what you should do anyway: run it as cheaply as possible.\nFor years I've been telling founders that the surest route to success\nis to be the cockroaches of the corporate world.  The immediate\ncause of death in a startup is always running out of money. So the\ncheaper your company is to operate, the harder it is to kill.\nAnd fortunately it has gotten very cheap to run a startup. A recession\nwill if anything make it cheaper still.<br/><br/>If nuclear winter really is here, it may be safer to be a cockroach\neven than to keep your job.  Customers may drop off individually\nif they can no longer afford you, but you're not going to lose them\nall at once; markets don't \"reduce headcount.\"<br/><br/>What if you quit your job to start a startup that fails, and you\ncan't find another?  That could be a problem if you work in sales or\nmarketing.  In those fields it can take months to find a new\njob in a bad economy.  But hackers seem to be more liquid.  Good\nhackers can always get some kind of job.  It might not be your dream\njob, but you're not going to starve.<br/><br/>Another advantage of bad times is that there's less competition.\nTechnology trains leave the station at regular intervals.  If \neveryone else is cowering in a corner, you may have a whole car to\nyourself.<br/><br/>You're an investor too.  As a founder, you're buying stock with\nwork: the reason Larry and Sergey are so rich is not so much that\nthey've done work worth tens of billions of dollars, but that they\nwere the first investors in Google.  And like any investor you\nshould buy when times are bad.<br/><br/>Were you nodding in agreement, thinking \"stupid investors\" a few\nparagraphs ago when I was talking about how investors are reluctant\nto put money into startups in bad markets, even though that's the\ntime they should rationally be most willing to buy?  Well, founders\naren't much better.  When times get bad, hackers go to grad school.\nAnd no doubt that will happen this time too.  In fact, what makes\nthe preceding paragraph true is that most readers won't believe\nitâ€”at least to the extent of acting on it.<br/><br/>So maybe a recession is a good time to start a startup.  It's hard\nto say whether advantages like lack of competition outweigh\ndisadvantages like reluctant investors.  But it doesn't matter much\neither way.   It's the people that matter.  And for a given set of\npeople working on a given technology, the time to act is always\nnow.<br/><br/></br></p></font>","date":"2008-10-01T00:00:00Z"}
