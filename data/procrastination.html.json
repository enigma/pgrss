But this is, strictly speaking, impossible.  There are an\ninfinite number of things you could be doing.  No matter what you\nwork on, you're not working on everything else.  So the question\nis not how to avoid procrastination, but how to procrastinate well.<br/><br/>There are three variants of procrastination, depending on what you\ndo instead of working on something: you could work on (a) nothing,\n(b) something less important, or (c) something more important.  That\nlast type, I'd argue, is good procrastination.<br/><br/>That's the \"absent-minded professor,\" who forgets to shave, or eat,\nor even perhaps look where he's going while he's thinking about\nsome interesting question.   His mind is absent from the everyday\nworld because it's hard at work in another.<br/><br/>That's the sense in which the most impressive people I know are all\nprocrastinators.  They're type-C procrastinators:  they put off\nworking on small stuff to work on big stuff.<br/><br/>What's \"small stuff?\"  Roughly, work that has zero chance of being\nmentioned in your obituary.  It's hard to say at the time what will\nturn out to be your best work (will it be your magnum opus on\nSumerian temple architecture, or the detective thriller you wrote\nunder a pseudonym?), but there's a whole class of tasks you can\nsafely rule out: shaving, doing your laundry, cleaning the house,\nwriting thank-you notes—anything that might be called an errand.<br/><br/>Good procrastination is avoiding errands to do real work.<br/><br/>Good in a sense, at least.  The people who want you to do the errands\nwon't think it's good.  But you probably have to annoy them if you\nwant to get anything done.  The mildest seeming people, if they\nwant to do real work, all have a certain degree of ruthlessness\nwhen it comes to avoiding errands.<br/><br/>Some errands, like replying to letters, go away if you\nignore them (perhaps taking friends with them).  Others, like mowing\nthe lawn, or filing tax returns, only get worse if you put them\noff.  In principle it shouldn't work to put off the second kind of\nerrand.  You're going to have to do whatever it is eventually.  Why\nnot (as past-due notices are always saying) do it now?<br/><br/>The reason it pays to put off even those errands is that real work\nneeds two things errands don't: big chunks of time, and the\nright mood.  If you get inspired by some project, it can be a net\nwin to blow off everything you were supposed to do for the next few\ndays to work on it.  Yes, those errands may cost you more time when\nyou finally get around to them.  But if you get a lot done during\nthose few days, you will be net more productive.<br/><br/>In fact, it may not be a difference in degree, but a difference in\nkind.  There may be types of work that can only be done in long,\nuninterrupted stretches, when inspiration hits, rather than dutifully\nin scheduled little slices.  Empirically it seems to be so.  When\nI think of the people I know who've done great things, I don't\nimagine them dutifully crossing items off to-do lists.  I imagine\nthem sneaking off to work on some new idea.<br/><br/>Conversely, forcing someone to perform errands synchronously is\nbound to limit their productivity.  The cost of an interruption is\nnot just the time it takes, but that it breaks the time on either\nside in half.  You probably only have to interrupt someone a couple\ntimes a day before they're unable to work on hard problems at all.<br/><br/>I've wondered a lot about why \n<a href=\"start.html\">startups</a> are most productive at the\nvery beginning, when they're just a couple guys in an apartment.\nThe main reason may be that there's no one to interrupt them yet.\nIn theory it's good when the founders finally get enough money to\nhire people to do some of the work for them.  But it may be better\nto be overworked than interrupted.  Once you dilute a startup with\nordinary office workers—with type-B procrastinators—the whole\ncompany starts to resonate at their frequency.  They're interrupt-driven,\nand soon you are too.<br/><br/>Errands are so effective at killing great projects that a lot of\npeople use them for that purpose.  Someone who has decided to write\na novel, for example, will suddenly find that the house needs\ncleaning. People who fail to write novels don't do it by sitting\nin front of a blank page for days without writing anything.  They\ndo it by feeding the cat, going out to buy something they need for\ntheir apartment, meeting a friend for coffee, checking email.  \"I\ndon't have time to work,\" they say.  And they don't; they've made\nsure of that.<br/><br/>(There's also a variant where one has no place to work.  The cure\nis to visit the places where famous people worked, and see how\nunsuitable they were.)<br/><br/>I've used both these excuses at one time or another.  I've learned\na lot of tricks for making myself work over the last 20 years, but\neven now I don't win consistently.  Some days I get real work done.\nOther days are eaten up by errands.  And I know it's usually my\nfault: I <i>let</i> errands eat up the day, to avoid\nfacing some hard problem.<br/><br/>The most dangerous form of procrastination is unacknowledged type-B\nprocrastination, because it doesn't feel like procrastination.\nYou're \"getting things done.\"  Just the wrong things.<br/><br/>Any advice about procrastination that concentrates on crossing\nthings off your to-do list is not only incomplete, but positively\nmisleading, if it doesn't consider the possibility that the to-do\nlist is itself a form of type-B procrastination.  In fact, possibility\nis too weak a word.  Nearly everyone's is.  Unless you're working\non the biggest things you could be working on, you're type-B\nprocrastinating, no matter how much you're getting done.<br/><br/>In his famous essay <a href=\"hamming.html\">You and Your Research</a> \n(which I recommend to\nanyone ambitious, no matter what they're working on), Richard Hamming\nsuggests that you ask yourself three questions:\n<ol>\n<li> What are the most important problems in your field?<br/><br/><li> Are you working on one of them?<br/><br/><li> Why not?\n</li></li></li></ol>\nHamming was at Bell Labs when he started asking such questions.  In\nprinciple anyone there ought to have been able to work on the most\nimportant problems in their field.  Perhaps not everyone can make\nan equally dramatic mark on the world; I don't know; but whatever\nyour capacities, there are projects that stretch them.  So Hamming's\nexercise can be generalized to:\n<blockquote>\n  What's the best thing you could be working on, and why aren't\n  you?\n</blockquote>\nMost people will shy away from this question.  I shy away from it\nmyself; I see it there on the page and quickly move on to the next\nsentence.  Hamming used to go around actually asking people this,\nand it didn't make him popular.  But it's a question anyone ambitious\nshould face.<br/><br/>The trouble is, you may end up hooking a very big fish with this\nbait.  To do good work, you need to do more than find good projects.\nOnce you've found them, you have to get yourself to work on them,\nand that can be hard.  The bigger the problem, the harder it is to\nget yourself to work on it.<br/><br/>Of course, the main reason people find it difficult to work on a\nparticular problem is that they don't \n<a href=\"hs.html\">enjoy</a> it.  When you're young,\nespecially, you often find yourself working on stuff you don't\nreally like-- because it seems impressive, for example, or because\nyou've been assigned to work on it.  Most grad students are stuck\nworking on big problems they don't really like, and grad school is\nthus synonymous with procrastination.<br/><br/>But even when you like what you're working on, it's easier to get\nyourself to work on small problems than big ones.  Why?  Why is it\nso hard to work on big problems?  One reason is that you may not\nget any reward in the forseeable future.  If you work on something\nyou can finish in a day or two, you can expect to have a nice feeling\nof accomplishment fairly soon.  If the reward is indefinitely far\nin the future, it seems less real.<br/><br/>Another reason people don't work on big projects is, ironically,\nfear of wasting time.  What if they fail?  Then all the time they\nspent on it will be wasted.  (In fact it probably won't be, because\nwork on hard projects almost always leads somewhere.)<br/><br/>But the trouble with big problems can't be just that they promise\nno immediate reward and might cause you to waste a lot of time.  If\nthat were all, they'd be no worse than going to visit your in-laws.\nThere's more to it than that.  Big problems are <i>terrifying</i>.\nThere's an almost physical pain in facing them.  It's like having\na vacuum cleaner hooked up to your imagination.   All your initial\nideas get sucked out immediately, and you don't have any more, and\nyet the vacuum cleaner is still sucking.<br/><br/>You can't look a big problem too directly in the eye. You have to\napproach it somewhat obliquely.  But you have to adjust the angle\njust right: you have to be facing the big problem directly enough\nthat you catch some of the excitement radiating from it, but not\nso much that it paralyzes you.  You can tighten the angle once you\nget going, just as a sailboat can sail closer to the wind once it\ngets underway.<br/><br/>If you want to work on big things, you seem to have to trick yourself\ninto doing it.  You have to work on small things that could grow\ninto big things, or work on successively larger things, or split\nthe moral load with collaborators.  It's not a sign of weakness to\ndepend on such tricks.  The very best work has been done this way.<br/><br/>When I talk to people who've managed to make themselves work on big\nthings, I find that all blow off errands, and all feel guilty about\nit.  I don't think they should feel guilty.  There's more to do\nthan anyone could.  So someone doing the best work they can is\ninevitably going to leave a lot of errands undone.  It seems a\nmistake to feel bad about that.<br/><br/>I think the way to \"solve\" the problem of procrastination is to let\ndelight pull you instead of making a to-do list push you.  Work on\nan ambitious project you really enjoy, and sail as close to the\nwind as you can, and you'll leave the right things undone.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and Robert\nMorris for reading drafts of this.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2005-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
