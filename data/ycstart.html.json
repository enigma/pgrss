{"href":"ycstart.html","title":"How Y Combinator Started","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">March 2012<br/><br/>Y Combinator's 7th birthday was March 11.   As usual we were so\nbusy we didn't notice till a few days after.  I don't think we've\never managed to remember our birthday on our birthday.\n<p>\nOn March 11 2005, Jessica and I were walking home from dinner in\nHarvard Square.  Jessica was working at an investment bank at the\ntime, but she didn't like it much, so she had interviewed for a job\nas director of marketing at a Boston VC fund.  The VC fund was doing\nwhat now seems a comically familiar thing for a VC fund to do:\ntaking a long time to make up their mind.  Meanwhile I had been\ntelling Jessica all the things they should change about the VC\nbusiness  essentially the ideas now underlying Y Combinator:\ninvestors\nshould be making more, smaller investments, they should be funding\nhackers instead of suits, they should be willing to fund younger\nfounders, etc.\n<p>\nAt the time I had been thinking about doing some angel investing.  I\nhad just given a talk to the undergraduate computer club at Harvard\nabout\n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/start.html\"><font color=\"#000099\">how to start a\nstartup</font></a>, and it\nhit me afterward that although I had always\nmeant to do angel investing, 7 years had now passed since I got\nenough money to do it, and I still hadn't started.  I had also\nbeen thinking about ways to work with Robert Morris and Trevor\nBlackwell again.  A few hours before I had\nsent them an email trying to figure out what we could do together.\n<p>\nBetween Harvard Square and my house the idea gelled.  We'd start\nour own investment firm and Jessica could work for that instead.\nAs we turned onto Walker Street we decided to do it.  I agreed to\nput $100k into the new fund and Jessica agreed to quit her job to\nwork for it.  Over the next couple days I recruited Robert\nand Trevor, who put in another $50k each.  So YC\nstarted with $200k.\n<p>\nJessica was so happy to be able to quit her job and start her own\ncompany that I took her <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20170609055553/http://www.ycombinator.com/yc05.html\">picture</a>\n when we got home.\n<p>\nThe company wasn't called Y Combinator yet. At first we called it\nCambridge Seed.  But that name never saw the light of day, because\nby the time we announced it a few days later, we'd changed the name\nto Y Combinator.  We realized early on that what we were doing could\nbe national in scope and we didn't want a name that tied us to one\nplace.\n<p>\nInitially we only had part of the idea. We were going to do\nseed funding with standardized terms.  Before YC, seed funding was\nvery haphazard. You'd get that first $10k from your friend's rich\nuncle. The deal terms were often a disaster; often neither the\ninvestor nor the founders nor the lawyer knew what the documents\nshould look like.  Facebook's early history as a Florida LLC shows\nhow random things could be in those days.  We were going to be\nsomething there had not been before: a standard source of seed\nfunding.\n<p>\nWe modelled YC on the seed funding we ourselves had taken\nwhen we started Viaweb.  We started Viaweb with $10k we got from\nour friend <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/julian.html\"><font color=\"#000099\">Julian Weber</font></a>,\nthe husband of Idelle Weber, whose\npainting class I took as a grad student at Harvard.  Julian knew\nabout business, but you would not describe him as a suit.  Among\nother things he'd been president of the <i>National Lampoon</i>.  He was\nalso a lawyer, and got all our paperwork set up properly.  In return\nfor $10k, getting us set up as a company, teaching us what\nbusiness was about, and remaining calm in times of crisis, Julian\ngot 10% of Viaweb.  I remember thinking once what a good deal\nJulian got.  And then a second later I realized that without\nJulian, Viaweb would never have made it.  So even though it was a\ngood deal for him, it was a good deal for us too.  That's why I\nknew there was room for something like Y Combinator.\n<p>\nInitially we didn't have what turned out to be the most important\nidea: funding startups synchronously, instead of asynchronously as\nit had always been done before.  Or rather we had the idea, but we\ndidn't realize its significance.  We decided very early \nthat the first thing we'd do would\nbe to fund a bunch of startups over the coming summer.  But we\ndidn't realize initially that this would be the way we'd do all our\ninvesting.  The reason we began by funding a bunch of startups at\nonce was not that we thought it would be a better way to fund\nstartups, but simply because we wanted to learn how to be angel\ninvestors, and a summer program for undergrads seemed the fastest\nway to do it.  No one takes summer jobs that seriously.  The\nopportunity cost for a bunch of undergrads to spend a summer working\non startups was low enough that we wouldn't feel guilty encouraging\nthem to do it.\n<p>\nWe knew students would already be making plans for the summer, so\nwe did what we're always telling startups to do: we launched fast.\nHere are the\ninitial <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/summerfounder.html\"><font color=\"#000099\">announcement</font></a>\nand <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20170609055553/http://ycombinator.com/old/sfp.html\">description</a> of what\nwas at the time called the Summer Founders Program.\n<p>\nWe got lucky in that the length and structure of a summer program\nturns out to be perfect for what we do.\nThe structure of the YC cycle is still almost identical to what\nit was that first summer.\n<p>\nWe also got lucky in who the first batch of founders were.  We never\nexpected to make any money from that first batch.  We thought of\nthe money we were investing as a combination of an educational expense\nand a charitable donation.  But the\nfounders in the first batch turned out to be surprisingly good.\nAnd great people too.  We're still friends with a lot of them today.\n<p>\nIt's hard for people to realize now how inconsequential YC seemed at the\ntime.  I can't blame people who didn't take us seriously, because\nwe ourselves didn't take that first summer program seriously in the\nvery beginning.  But as the summer progressed we were increasingly\nimpressed by how well the startups were doing.  Other people started\nto be impressed too.  Jessica and I invented a term, \"the Y Combinator\neffect,\" to describe the moment when the realization hit someone\nthat YC was not totally lame.  When people came to YC to speak\nat the dinners that first summer, they came in the spirit of someone\ncoming to address a Boy Scout troop.  By the time they left the\nbuilding they were all saying some variant of \"Wow, these\ncompanies might actually succeed.\"\n<p>\nNow YC is well enough known that people are no longer surprised\nwhen the companies we fund are legit, but it took a\nwhile for reputation to catch up with reality.  That's one of the\nreasons we especially like funding ideas that might be dismissed\nas \"toys\"  because YC itself was dismissed as one initially.\n<p>\nWhen we saw how well it worked to fund companies synchronously,\nwe decided we'd keep doing that.  We'd fund two batches of\nstartups a year.\n<p>\nWe funded the second batch in Silicon Valley.  That was\na last minute decision.  In retrospect I think what pushed me over\nthe edge was going to Foo Camp that fall.  The density of startup\npeople in the Bay Area was so much greater than in Boston, and the\nweather was so nice.  I remembered that from living there in the\n90s.  Plus I didn't want someone else to copy us and describe it\nas the Y Combinator of Silicon Valley.  I wanted YC to be the Y Combinator \nof Silicon Valley.  So doing the winter batch in California\nseemed like one of those rare cases where the self-indulgent choice\nand the ambitious one were the same.\n<p>\nIf we'd had enough time to do what we wanted, Y Combinator would\nhave been in Berkeley.  That was our favorite part of the Bay Area.\nBut we didn't have time to get a building in Berkeley.  We didn't\nhave time to get our own building anywhere. The only way to get\nenough space in time was to convince Trevor to let us take over\npart of his (as it then seemed) giant building in Mountain View.\nYet again we lucked out, because Mountain View turned out to be the\nideal place to put something like YC.  But even then we barely made\nit.  The first dinner in California, we had to warn all the founders\nnot to touch the walls, because the paint was still wet.<br/><br/></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></font>","date":"2012-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
