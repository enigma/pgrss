{"href":"maybe.html","title":"Can You Buy a Silicon Valley?  Maybe.","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">February 2009<br/><br/>A lot of cities look at Silicon Valley and ask \"How could we make\nsomething like that happen here?\"  The \n<a href=\"siliconvalley.html\">organic</a> way to do it is to\nestablish a first-rate university in a place where rich people want\nto live. That's how Silicon Valley happened.  But could you shortcut\nthe process by funding startups?<br/><br/>Possibly. Let's consider what it would take.<br/><br/>The first thing to understand is that encouraging startups is a\ndifferent problem from encouraging startups in a particular city.\nThe latter is much more expensive.<br/><br/>People sometimes think they could improve the startup scene in their\ntown by starting something like <a href=\"http://ycombinator.com\">Y \nCombinator</a> there, but in fact it\nwill have near zero effect.  I know because Y Combinator itself had\nnear zero effect on Boston when we were based there half the year.\nThe people we funded came from all over the country (indeed, the\nworld) and afterward they went wherever they could get more\nfunding—which generally meant Silicon Valley.<br/><br/>The seed funding business is not a regional business, because at\nthat stage startups are mobile. They're just a couple founders with\nlaptops. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f1n\"><font color=\"#999999\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>If you want to encourage startups in a particular city, you have\nto fund startups that won't leave.  There are two ways to do that:\nhave rules preventing them from leaving, or fund them at the point\nin their life when they naturally take root.  The first approach\nis a mistake, because it becomes a filter for selecting bad startups.\nIf your terms force startups to do things they don't want to, only\nthe desperate ones will take your money.<br/><br/>Good startups will move to another city as a condition of funding.\nWhat they won't do is agree not to move the next time they need\nfunding.  So the only way to get them to stay is to give them enough\nthat they never need to leave.<br/><br/><center>___</center><br/><br/>How much would that take?  If you want to keep startups from leaving\nyour town, you have to give them enough that they're not tempted\nby an offer from Silicon Valley VCs that requires them to move.  A\nstartup would be able to refuse such an offer if they had grown to\nthe point where they were (a) rooted in your town and/or (b) so\nsuccessful that VCs would fund them even if they didn't move.<br/><br/>How much would it cost to grow a startup to that point? A minimum\nof several hundred thousand dollars.  <a href=\"http://wufoo.com\">Wufoo</a> \nseem to have rooted\nthemselves in Tampa on $118k, but they're an extreme case.  On\naverage it would take at least half a million.<br/><br/>So if it seems too good to be true to think you could grow a local\nsilicon valley by giving startups $15-20k each like Y Combinator,\nthat's because it is.  To make them stick around you'd have to give\nthem at least 20 times that much.<br/><br/>However, even that is an interesting prospect.  Suppose to be on\nthe safe side it would cost a million dollars per startup. If you\ncould get startups to stick to your town for a million apiece, then\nfor a billion dollars you could bring in a thousand startups. That probably wouldn't push you past Silicon Valley itself, \nbut it might get you second place.<br/><br/>For the price of a football stadium, any town that was decent to\nlive in could make itself one of the biggest startup hubs in the\nworld.<br/><br/>What's more, it wouldn't take very long.   You could probably do\nit in five years.  During the term of one mayor. And it would get\neasier over time, because the more startups you had in town, the\nless it would take to get new ones to move there. By the time you\nhad a thousand startups in town, the VCs wouldn't be trying so hard\nto get them to move to Silicon Valley; instead they'd be opening\nlocal offices.  Then you'd really be in good shape.  You'd have\nstarted a self-sustaining chain reaction like the one that drives\nthe Valley.<br/><br/><center>___</center><br/><br/>But now comes the hard part.  You have to pick the startups.  How\ndo you do that?  Picking startups is a rare and valuable skill, and\nthe handful of people who have it are not readily hireable.  And\nthis skill is so hard to measure that if a government did try to\nhire people with it, they'd almost certainly get the wrong ones.<br/><br/>For example, a city could give money to a VC fund to establish a\nlocal branch, and let them make the choices.  But only a bad VC\nfund would take that deal.  They wouldn't <i>seem</i> bad to the city\nofficials.  They'd seem very impressive.  But they'd be bad at\npicking startups.  That's the characteristic failure mode of VCs.\nAll VCs look impressive to limited partners.  The difference between\nthe good ones and the bad ones only becomes visible in the other\nhalf of their jobs: choosing and advising startups.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f2n\"><font color=\"#999999\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>What you really want is a pool of local angel investors—people\ninvesting money they made from their own startups.  But unfortunately\nyou run into a chicken and egg problem here.  If your city isn't\nalready a startup hub, there won't be people there who got rich\nfrom startups. And there is no way I can think of that a city could\nattract angels from outside. By definition they're rich.  There's\nno incentive that would make them move.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f3n\"><font color=\"#999999\">3</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>However, a city could select startups by piggybacking on the expertise\nof investors who weren't local.  It would be pretty straightforward\nto make a list of the most eminent Silicon Valley angels and from\nthat to generate a list of all the startups they'd invested in.  If\na city offered these companies a million dollars each to move, a\nlot of the earlier stage ones would probably take it.<br/><br/>Preposterous as this plan sounds, it's probably the most efficient\nway a city could select good startups.<br/><br/>It would hurt the startups somewhat to be separated from their\noriginal investors. On the other hand, the extra million dollars\nwould give them a lot more runway.<br/><br/><center>___</center><br/><br/>Would the transplanted startups survive?  Quite possibly. The only\nway to find out would be to try it.  It would be a pretty cheap\nexperiment, as civil expenditures go.  Pick 30 startups that eminent\nangels have recently invested in, give them each a million dollars\nif they'll relocate to your city, and see what happens after a year.\nIf they seem to be thriving, you can try importing startups on a\nlarger scale.<br/><br/>Don't be too legalistic about the conditions under which they're\nallowed to leave.  Just have a gentlemen's agreement.<br/><br/>Don't try to do it on the cheap and pick only 10 for the initial\nexperiment.  If you do this on too small a scale you'll just guarantee\nfailure. Startups need to be around other startups.  30 would be\nenough to feel like a community.<br/><br/>Don't try to make them all work in some renovated warehouse you've\nmade into an \"incubator.\"  Real startups prefer to work in their\nown spaces.<br/><br/>In fact, don't impose any restrictions on the startups at all.\nStartup founders are mostly <a href=\"gba.html\">hackers</a>, \nand hackers are much more\nconstrained by gentlemen's agreements than regulations.  If they\nshake your hand on a promise, they'll keep it.  But show them a\nlock and their first thought is how to pick it.<br/><br/>Interestingly, the 30-startup experiment could be done by any\nsufficiently rich private citizen.  And what pressure it would \nput on the city if it worked.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f4n\"><font color=\"#999999\">4</font></a>]</font><br/><br/><center>___</center><br/><br/>Should the city take stock in return for the money?\nIn principle they're entitled to, but how would they choose valuations\nfor the startups?  You couldn't just give them all the same valuation:\nthat would be too low for some (who'd turn you down) and too high\nfor others (because it might make their next round a \"down round\").\nAnd since we're assuming we're doing this without being able to\npick startups, we also have to assume we can't value them, since\nthat's practically the same thing.<br/><br/>Another reason not to take stock in the startups is that startups\nare often involved in disreputable things.  So are established\ncompanies, but they don't get blamed for it.  If someone gets\nmurdered by someone they met on Facebook, the press will treat the\nstory as if it were about Facebook.  If someone gets murdered by\nsomeone they met at a supermarket, the press will just treat it as\na story about a murder.  So understand that if you invest in startups,\nthey might build things that get used for pornography, or file-sharing,\nor the expression of unfashionable opinions.  You should probably\nsponsor this project jointly with your political opponents, so they\ncan't use whatever the startups do as a club to beat you with.<br/><br/>It would be too much of a political liability just to give\nthe startups the money, though.  So the best plan would be to \nmake it convertible debt, but which didn't convert except in\na really big round, like $20 million.<br/><br/><center>___</center><br/><br/>How well this scheme worked would depend on the \n<a href=\"cities.html\">city</a>.  There are\nsome towns, like Portland, that would be easy to turn into startup\nhubs, and others, like Detroit, where it would really be an uphill\nbattle.  So be honest with yourself about the sort of town you have\nbefore you try this.<br/><br/>It will be easier in proportion to how much your town resembles San\nFrancisco.  Do you have good weather?  Do people live downtown, or\nhave they abandoned the center for the suburbs?  Would the city be\ndescribed as \"hip\" and \"tolerant,\" or as reflecting \"traditional\nvalues?\"  Are there good universities nearby?  Are there walkable\nneighborhoods?  Would nerds feel at home?  If you answered yes to\nall these questions, you might be able not only to pull off this\nscheme, but to do it for less than a million per startup.<br/><br/>I realize the chance of any city having\nthe political will to carry out this plan is microscopically\nsmall.  I just wanted to explore what it would take if one did.\nHow hard would it be to jumpstart a silicon valley?  It's\nfascinating to think this prize might be within\nthe reach of so many cities.  So even though they'll all still\nspend the money on the stadium, at least now someone can ask them:\nwhy did you choose to do that instead of becoming a serious\nrival to Silicon Valley?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nWhat people who start these supposedly local seed firms always\nfind is that (a) their applicants come from all over, not just the\nlocal area, and (b) the local startups also apply to the other seed\nfirms.  So what ends up happening is that the applicant pool gets\npartitioned by quality rather than geography.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nInterestingly, the bad VCs fail by choosing startups run by\npeople like them—people who are good presenters, but have no\nreal substance.   It's a case of the fake leading the fake.  And\nsince everyone involved is so plausible, the LPs who invest in these\nfunds have no idea what's happening till they measure their returns.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nNot even being a tax haven, I suspect.  That makes some rich\npeople move, but not the type who would make good angel investors\nin startups.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f4n\"><font color=\"#000000\">4</font></a>]\nThanks to Michael Keenan for pointing this out.<br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, Robert\nMorris, and Fred Wilson for reading drafts of this.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2009-02-01T00:00:00Z"}
