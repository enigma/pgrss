{"href":"trolls.html","title":"Trolls","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">February 2008<br/><br/>A user on Hacker News recently posted a\n<a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=116938\">comment</a>\nthat set me thinking:\n<blockquote>\n  Something about hacker culture that never really set well with\n  me was this  the nastiness. ... I just don't understand why people\n  troll like they do.\n</blockquote>\nI've thought a lot over the last couple years about the problem of\ntrolls.  It's an old one, as old as forums, but\nwe're still just learning what the causes are and how to address\nthem.<br/><br/>There are two senses of the word \"troll.\"  In the original sense\nit meant someone, usually an outsider, who deliberately stirred up\nfights in a forum by saying controversial things.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f1n\"><font color=\"#999999\">1</font></a>]</font>\nFor example,\nsomeone who didn't use a certain programming language might go to\na forum for users of that language and make disparaging remarks\nabout it, then sit back and watch as people rose to the bait.  This\nsort of trolling was in the nature of a practical joke, like letting\na bat loose in a room full of people.<br/><br/>The definition then spread to people who behaved like assholes in\nforums, whether intentionally or not.  Now when people talk about\ntrolls they usually mean this broader sense of the word.  Though\nin a sense this is historically inaccurate, it is in other ways\nmore accurate, because when someone is being an asshole it's usually\nuncertain even in their own mind how much is deliberate.\nThat is arguably one of the defining qualities of an asshole.<br/><br/>I think trolling in the broader sense has four causes.  The most\nimportant is distance.  People will say things in anonymous forums\nthat they'd never dare say to someone's face, just as they'll do\nthings in cars that they'd never do as pedestrians  like tailgate\npeople, or honk at them, or cut them off.<br/><br/>Trolling tends to be particularly bad in forums related to computers,\nand I think that's due to the kind of people you find there.  Most\nof them (myself included) are more comfortable dealing with abstract\nideas than with people.  Hackers can be abrupt even in person.  Put\nthem on an anonymous forum, and the problem gets worse.<br/><br/>The third cause of trolling is incompetence.  If you disagree with\nsomething, it's easier to say \"you suck\" than to figure out and\nexplain exactly what you disagree with.  You're also safe that way\nfrom refutation.  In this respect trolling is a lot like graffiti.\nGraffiti happens at the intersection of ambition and incompetence:\npeople want to make their mark on the world, but have no other way\nto do it than literally making a mark on the world.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f2n\"><font color=\"#999999\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The final contributing factor is the culture of the forum.  Trolls\nare like children (many <i>are</i> children) in that they're capable of\na wide range of behavior depending on what they think will be\ntolerated.  In a place where rudeness isn't tolerated, most can be\npolite.  But vice versa as well.<br/><br/>There's a sort of Gresham's Law of trolls: trolls are willing to\nuse a forum with a lot of thoughtful people in it, but thoughtful\npeople aren't willing to use a forum with a lot of trolls in it.\nWhich means that once trolling takes hold, it tends to become the\ndominant culture.  That had already happened to Slashdot and Digg by\nthe time I paid attention to comment threads there, but I watched\nit happen to Reddit.<br/><br/><xa href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com\">News.YC is, among other things, an experiment to see if this fate\ncan be avoided.  The sites's <a href=\"http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html\">guidelines</a>\nexplicitly ask people not to say things they wouldn't say face to\nface.  If someone starts being rude, other users will step in and\ntell them to stop.  And when people seem to be deliberately trolling,\nwe ban them ruthlessly.<br/><br/>Technical tweaks may also help.  On Reddit, votes on your comments\ndon't affect your karma score, but they do on News.YC.  And it does\nseem to influence people when they can see their reputation in the\neyes of their peers drain away after making an asshole remark.\nOften users have second thoughts and delete such comments.<br/><br/>One might worry this would prevent people from expressing controversial\nideas, but empirically that doesn't seem to be what happens.  When\npeople say something substantial that gets modded down, they\nstubbornly leave it up.  What people delete are wisecracks, because\nthey have less invested in them.<br/><br/>So far the experiment seems to be working.  The level of conversation\non News.YC is as high as on any forum I've seen.  But we still only\nhave about 8,000 uniques a day.  The conversations on Reddit were\ngood when it was that small.  The challenge is whether we can keep\nthings this way.<br/><br/>I'm optimistic we will.  We're not depending just on technical\ntricks.  The core users of News.YC are mostly refugees from other\nsites that were overrun by trolls.  They feel about trolls roughly\nthe way refugees from Cuba or Eastern Europe feel about dictatorships.\nSo there are a lot of people working to keep this from happening\nagain.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nI mean forum in the general sense of a place to exchange views.\nThe original Internet forums were not web sites but Usenet newsgroups.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nI'm talking here about everyday tagging.  Some graffiti is\nquite impressive (anything becomes art if you do it well enough)\nbut the median tag is just visual spam.<br/><br/></xa></font>","date":"2008-02-01T00:00:00Z"}
