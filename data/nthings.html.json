{"href":"nthings.html","title":"The List of N Things","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">September 2009<br/><br/>I bet you the current issue of <i>Cosmopolitan</i> has an article\nwhose title begins with a number. \"7 Things He Won't Tell You about\nSex,\" or something like that.  Some popular magazines\nfeature articles of this type on the cover of every\nissue.  That can't be happening by accident.  Editors must know\nthey attract readers.<br/><br/>Why do readers like the list of n things so much?   Mainly because\nit's easier to read than a regular article.  \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f1n\"><font color=\"#999999\">1</font></a>]</font>\nStructurally, the list of n things is a degenerate case of essay.\nAn essay can go anywhere the writer wants.  In a list of n things\nthe writer agrees to constrain himself to a collection of points\nof roughly equal importance, and he tells the reader explicitly\nwhat they are.<br/><br/>Some of the work of reading an article is understanding its\nstructure—figuring out what in high school we'd have called\nits \"outline.\" Not explicitly, of course, but someone who really\nunderstands an article probably has something in his brain afterward\nthat corresponds to such an outline.  In a list of n things, this\nwork is done for you.  Its structure is an exoskeleton.<br/><br/>As well as being explicit, the structure is guaranteed to be of the\nsimplest possible type: a few main points with few to no subordinate\nones, and no particular connection between them.<br/><br/>Because the main points are unconnected, the list of n things is\nrandom access.  There's no thread of reasoning you have to follow.  You could\nread the list in any order.  And because the points are independent\nof one another, they work like watertight compartments in an\nunsinkable ship.  If you get bored with, or can't understand, or\ndon't agree with one point, you don't have to give up on the article.\nYou can just abandon that one and skip to the next.  A list of n\nthings is parallel and therefore fault tolerant.<br/><br/>There are times when this format is what a writer wants.  One, obviously,\nis when what you have to say actually is a list of n\nthings.  I once wrote an essay about the <a href=\"startupmistakes.html\">mistakes that kill startups</a>, and a few people made fun of me\nfor writing something whose title began with a number.  But in that\ncase I really was trying to make a complete catalog of a number of\nindependent things.  In fact, one of the questions I was trying to\nanswer was how many there were.<br/><br/>There are other less legitimate reasons for using this format.  For\nexample, I use it when I get close to a deadline.  If I have to\ngive a talk and I haven't started it a few days beforehand, I'll\nsometimes play it safe and make the talk a list of n things.<br/><br/>The list of n things is easier for writers as well as readers.  When\nyou're writing a real essay, there's always a chance you'll hit a\ndead end.  A real essay is a train of thought, and some trains of\nthought just peter out.  That's an alarming possibility when you\nhave to give a talk in a few days.  What if you run out of ideas?\nThe compartmentalized structure of the list of n things protects\nthe writer from his own stupidity in much the same way it protects\nthe reader.  If you run out of ideas on one point, no problem: it\nwon't kill the essay.  You can take out the whole point if you need\nto, and the essay will still survive.<br/><br/>Writing a list of n things is so relaxing.  You think of n/2 of\nthem in the first 5 minutes.  So bang, there's the structure, and\nyou just have to fill it in.  As you think of more points, you just\nadd them to the end.  Maybe you take out or rearrange or combine a\nfew, but at every stage you have a valid (though initially low-res)\nlist of n things.  It's like the sort of programming where you write\na version 1 very quickly and then gradually modify it, but at every\npoint have working code—or the style of painting where you begin\nwith a complete but very blurry sketch done in an hour, then spend\na week cranking up the resolution.<br/><br/>Because the list of n things is easier for writers too, it's not\nalways a damning sign when readers prefer it.  It's not necessarily\nevidence readers are lazy; it could also mean they don't have\nmuch confidence in the writer.  The list of n things is in that\nrespect the cheeseburger of essay forms.  If you're eating at a\nrestaurant you suspect is bad, your best bet is to order the\ncheeseburger.  Even a bad cook can make a decent cheeseburger.  And\nthere are pretty strict conventions about what a cheeseburger should\nlook like.  You can assume the cook isn't going to try something\nweird and artistic.  The list of n things similarly limits the\ndamage that can be done by a bad writer.  You know it's going to\nbe about whatever the title says, and the format prevents the writer\nfrom indulging in any flights of fancy.<br/><br/>Because the list of n things is the easiest essay form, it should\nbe a good one for beginning writers.  And in fact it is what most\nbeginning writers are taught.  The classic 5 paragraph essay is\nreally a list of n things for n = 3.  But the students writing them\ndon't realize they're using the same structure as the articles they\nread in <i>Cosmopolitan</i>. They're not allowed to include the numbers,\nand they're expected to spackle over the gaps with gratuitous\ntransitions (\"Furthermore...\") and cap the thing at either end with\nintroductory and concluding paragraphs so it will look superficially\nlike a real essay.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f2n\"><font color=\"#999999\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>It seems a fine plan to start students off with the list of n things.\nIt's the easiest form.  But if we're going to do that, why not do\nit openly?  Let them write lists of n things like the pros, with\nnumbers and no transitions or \"conclusion.\"<br/><br/>There is one case where the list of n things is a dishonest format:\nwhen you use it to attract attention by falsely claiming the list\nis an exhaustive one.  I.e. if you write an article that purports\nto be about <i>the</i> 7 secrets of success.  That kind of title is the\nsame sort of reflexive challenge as a whodunit. You have to at least\nlook at the article to check whether they're the same 7 you'd list.\nAre you overlooking one of the secrets of success?  Better check.<br/><br/>It's fine to put \"The\" before the number if you really believe\nyou've made an exhaustive list.  But evidence suggests most things\nwith titles like this are linkbait.<br/><br/>The greatest weakness of the list of n things is that there's so\nlittle room for new thought.  The main point of essay writing, when\ndone right, is the new ideas you have while doing it.  A real essay,\nas the name implies, is \n<a href=\"essay.html\">dynamic</a>: you don't know what you're going\nto write when you start.  It will be about whatever you discover\nin the course of writing it.<br/><br/>This can only happen in a very limited way in a list of n things.\nYou make the title first, and that's what it's going to be about.\nYou can't have more new ideas in the writing than will fit in the\nwatertight compartments you set up initially.  And your brain seems\nto know this: because you don't have room for new ideas, you don't\nhave them.<br/><br/>Another advantage of admitting to beginning writers that the 5\nparagraph essay is really a list of n things is that we can warn\nthem about this.  It only lets you experience the defining\ncharacteristic of essay writing on a small scale: in thoughts of a\nsentence or two.  And it's particularly dangerous that the 5 paragraph\nessay buries the list of n things within something that looks like\na more sophisticated type of essay.  If you don't know you're using\nthis form, you don't know you need to escape it.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nArticles of this type are also startlingly popular on Delicious,\nbut I think that's because \n<a href=\"http://delicious.com/popular\">delicious/popular</a> \nis driven by bookmarking,\nnot because Delicious users are stupid.  Delicious users are\ncollectors, and a list of n things seems particularly collectible\nbecause it's a collection itself.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nMost \"word problems\" in school math textbooks are similarly\nmisleading.  They look superficially like the application of math\nto real problems, but they're not.  So if anything they reinforce\nthe impression that math is merely a complicated but pointless\ncollection of stuff to be memorized.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></font>","date":"2009-09-01T00:00:00Z"}
