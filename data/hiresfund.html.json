By making it easier\nfor startups to give different prices to different investors, they\nhelp them break the sort of deadlock that happens when investors\nall wait to see who else is going to invest.<br/><br/>By far the biggest influence on investors' opinions of a startup\nis the opinion of other investors.  There are very, very few who\nsimply decide for themselves.  Any startup founder can tell you the\nmost common question they hear from investors is not about the\nfounders or the product, but \"who else is investing?\"<br/><br/>That tends to produce deadlocks.  Raising an old-fashioned \nfixed-size equity round can take weeks, because all the angels sit around\nwaiting for the others to commit, like competitors in a bicycle\nsprint who deliberately ride slowly at the start so they can follow\nwhoever breaks first.<br/><br/>Convertible notes let startups beat such deadlocks by rewarding\ninvestors willing to move first with lower (effective) valuations.\nWhich they deserve because they're taking more risk.  It's much\nsafer to invest in a startup Ron Conway has already invested in;\nsomeone who comes after him should pay a higher price.<br/><br/>The reason convertible notes allow more flexibility in price is\nthat valuation caps aren't actual valuations, and notes are cheap\nand easy to do.  So you can do high-resolution fundraising: if you\nwanted you could have a separate note with a different cap for each\ninvestor.<br/><br/>That cap need not simply rise monotonically.  A startup could \nalso give better deals to investors they expected to help\nthem most.  The point is simply that different investors, \nwhether because of the help they offer or their willingness to\ncommit, have different values for\nstartups, and their terms should reflect that.<br/><br/>Different terms for different investors is\nclearly the way of the future.  Markets always evolve toward higher\nresolution.  You may not need to use convertible notes to do it.\nWith sufficiently lightweight standardized equity terms (and some\nchanges in investors' and lawyers' expectations about equity rounds)\nyou might be able to do the same thing with equity instead of debt.\nEither would be fine with startups, so long as they can easily\nchange their valuation.<br/><br/>Deadlocks weren't the only problem with fixed-size equity rounds.\nAnother was that startups had to decide in advance how much to\nraise.  I think it's a mistake for a startup to fix upon a specific\nnumber. If investors are easily convinced, the startup should raise more\nnow, and if investors are skeptical, the startup should take a\nsmaller amount and use that to get the company to the point where\nit's more convincing.<br/><br/>It's just not reasonable to expect startups to pick an optimal round\nsize in advance, because that depends on the reactions of investors,\nand those are impossible to predict.<br/><br/>Fixed-size, multi-investor angel rounds are such a bad idea for\nstartups that one wonders why things were ever done that way.  One\npossibility is that this custom reflects the way investors like to\ncollude when they can get away with it.  But I think the actual\nexplanation is less sinister.  I think angels (and their lawyers)\norganized rounds this way in unthinking imitation of VC series A\nrounds.  In a series A, a fixed-size equity round with a lead makes\nsense, because there is usually just one big investor, who is\nunequivocally the lead.  Fixed-size series A rounds already are\nhigh res.  But the more investors you have in a round, the less\nsense it makes for everyone to get the same price.<br/><br/>The most interesting question here may be what high res fundraising\nwill do to the world of investors.  Bolder investors will now get\nrewarded with lower prices.  But more important, in a\nhits-driven business, is that they'll be able to get into the deals\nthey want.  Whereas the \"who else is investing?\" type of investors\nwill not only pay higher prices, but may not be able to get into\nthe best deals at all.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Immad Akhund, Sam Altman, John Bautista, Pete Koomen, \nJessica Livingston, Dan Siroker, Harj Taggar, and\nFred Wilson for reading drafts of this.<br/><br/></br></p></font>","date":"2010-09-01T00:00:00Z"}
