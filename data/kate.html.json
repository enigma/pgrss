{"href":"kate.html","title":"What Kate Saw in Silicon Valley","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">August 2009<br/><br/>Kate Courteau is the architect who designed Y Combinator's office.\nRecently we managed to recruit her to help us run YC when she's not\nbusy with architectural projects.  Though she'd heard a lot about\nYC since the beginning, the last 9 months have been a total immersion.<br/><br/>I've been around the startup world for so long that it seems normal\nto me, so I was curious to hear what had surprised her most about\nit.  This was her list:<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>1. How many startups fail.</b><br/><br/>Kate knew in principle that startups\nwere very risky, but she was surprised to see how constant the\nthreat of failure was â€” not just for the minnows, but even for the\nfamous startups whose founders came to speak at YC dinners.<br/><br/>\n<b>2. How much startups' ideas change.</b><br/><br/>As usual, by Demo Day about\nhalf the startups were doing something significantly different than\nthey started with.  We encourage that.  Starting a startup is like\nscience in that you have to follow the truth wherever it leads.  In\nthe rest of the world, people don't start things till they're sure\nwhat they want to do, and once started they tend to continue on their\ninitial path even if it's mistaken.<br/><br/>\n<b>3. How little money it can take to start a startup.</b><br/><br/>In Kate's\nworld, everything is still physical and expensive.  You can barely\nrenovate a bathroom for the cost of starting a startup.<br/><br/>\n<b>4. How scrappy founders are.</b><br/><br/>That was her actual word.  I agree\nwith her, but till she mentioned this it never occurred to me how\nlittle this quality is appreciated in most of the rest of the world.\nIt wouldn't be a compliment in most organizations to call someone\nscrappy.<br/><br/>What does it mean, exactly?  It's basically the diminutive form of\nbelligerent.  Someone who's scrappy manages to be both threatening\nand undignified at the same time.   Which seems to me exactly what\none would want to be, in any kind of work.  If you're not threatening,\nyou're probably not doing anything new, and dignity is merely a\nsort of plaque.<br/><br/>\n<b>5. How tech-saturated Silicon Valley is.</b><br/><br/>\"It seems like everybody\nhere is in the industry.\"  That isn't literally true, but there is\na qualitative difference between Silicon Valley and other places.\nYou tend to keep your voice down, because there's a good chance the\nperson at the next table would know some of the people you're talking\nabout.  I never felt that in Boston.  The good news is, there's\nalso a good chance the person at the next table could help you in\nsome way.<br/><br/>\n<b>6. That the speakers at YC were so consistent in their advice.</b><br/><br/>\nActually, I've noticed this too.  I always worry the speakers will\nput us in an embarrassing position by contradicting what we tell the\nstartups, but it happens surprisingly rarely.<br/><br/>When I asked her what specific things she remembered speakers always\nsaying, she mentioned: that the way to succeed was to launch something\nfast, listen to users, and then iterate; that startups required\nresilience because they were always an emotional rollercoaster; and\nthat most VCs were sheep.<br/><br/>I've been impressed by how consistently the speakers advocate\nlaunching fast and iterating.  That was contrarian advice 10 years\nago, but it's clearly now the established practice.<br/><br/>\n<b>7. How casual successful startup founders are.</b><br/><br/>Most of the famous\nfounders in Silicon Valley are people you'd overlook on the street.\nIt's not merely that they don't dress up.  They don't project any\nkind of aura of power either.  \"They're not trying to impress\nanyone.\"<br/><br/>Interestingly, while Kate said that she could never pick out\nsuccessful founders, she could recognize VCs, both by the way they\ndressed and the way they carried themselves.<br/><br/>\n<b>8. How important it is for founders to have people to ask for advice.</b><br/><br/>(I swear I didn't prompt this one.)  Without advice \"they'd just\nbe sort of lost.\"  Fortunately, there are a lot of people to help\nthem.  There's a strong tradition within YC of helping other YC-funded\nstartups.  But we didn't invent that idea: it's just a slightly\nmore concentrated form of existing Valley culture.<br/><br/>\n<b>9. What a solitary task startups are.</b><br/><br/>Architects are constantly\ninteracting face to face with other people, whereas doing a technology\nstartup, at least, tends to require long stretches of uninterrupted\ntime to work.  \"You could do it in a box.\"<br/><br/><br/><br/>By inverting this list, we can get a portrait of the \"normal\" world.\nIt's populated by people who talk a lot with one another as they\nwork slowly but harmoniously on conservative, expensive projects\nwhose destinations are decided in advance, and who carefully adjust\ntheir manner to reflect their position in the hierarchy.<br/><br/>That's also a fairly accurate description of the past.  So startup\nculture may not merely be different in the way you'd expect any\nsubculture to be, but a leading indicator.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2009-08-01T00:00:00Z"}
