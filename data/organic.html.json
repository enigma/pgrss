Apple\nwas the first type.  Apple happened because Steve Wozniak wanted a\ncomputer.  Unlike most people who wanted computers, he could design\none, so he did.  And since lots of other people wanted the same\nthing, Apple was able to sell enough of them to get the company\nrolling.  They still rely on this principle today, incidentally.\nThe iPhone is the phone Steve Jobs wants.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f1n\"><font color=\"#999999\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Our own startup, Viaweb, was of the second type.  We made software\nfor building online stores.  We didn't need this software ourselves.\nWe weren't direct marketers.  We didn't even know when we started\nthat our users were called \"direct marketers.\"  But we were\ncomparatively old when we started the company (I was 30 and Robert\nMorris was 29), so we'd seen enough to know users would need this\ntype of software.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f2n\"><font color=\"#999999\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>There is no sharp line between the two types of ideas, but\nthe most successful startups seem to be closer to the Apple type\nthan the Viaweb type.  When he was writing that first Basic interpreter\nfor the Altair, Bill Gates was writing something he would use, as\nwere Larry and Sergey when they wrote the first versions of Google.<br/><br/>Organic ideas are generally preferable to the made up kind, but\nparticularly so when the founders are young.  It takes experience\nto predict what other people will want.  The worst ideas we see at\nY Combinator are from young founders making things they think other\npeople will want.<br/><br/>So if you want to start a startup and don't know yet what you're\ngoing to do, I'd encourage you to focus initially on organic ideas.\nWhat's missing or broken in your daily life?  Sometimes if you just\nask that question you'll get immediate answers.  It must have seemed\nobviously broken to Bill Gates that you could only program the\nAltair in machine language.<br/><br/>You may need to stand outside yourself a bit to see brokenness,\nbecause you tend to get used to it and take it for granted.  You\ncan be sure it's there, though.  There are always great ideas sitting\nright under our noses.  In 2004 it was ridiculous that Harvard\nundergrads were still using a Facebook printed on paper.  Surely\nthat sort of thing should have been online.<br/><br/>There are ideas that obvious lying around now.  The reason you're\noverlooking them is the same reason you'd have overlooked the idea\nof building Facebook in 2004: organic startup ideas usually don't\nseem like startup ideas at first.  We know now that Facebook was\nvery successful, but put yourself back in 2004.  Putting undergraduates'\nprofiles online wouldn't have seemed like much of a startup idea.\nAnd in fact, it wasn't initially a startup idea.  When Mark spoke\nat a YC dinner this winter he said he wasn't trying to start a\ncompany when he wrote the first version of Facebook.  It was just\na project.  So was the Apple I when Woz first started working on\nit.  He didn't think he was starting a company.  If these guys had\nthought they were starting companies, they might have been tempted\nto do something more \"serious,\" and that would have been a mistake.<br/><br/>So if you want to come up with organic startup ideas, I'd encourage\nyou to focus more on the idea part and less on the startup part.\nJust fix things that seem broken, regardless of whether it seems\nlike the problem is important enough to build a company on.  If you\nkeep pursuing such threads it would be hard not to end up making\nsomething of value to a lot of people, and when you do, surprise,\nyou've got a company.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f3n\"><font color=\"#999999\">3</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Don't be discouraged if what you produce initially is something\nother people dismiss as a toy.  In fact, that's a good sign.\nThat's probably why everyone else has been overlooking the idea.  The first\nmicrocomputers were dismissed as toys.  And the first planes, and\nthe first cars.  At this point, when someone comes to us with\nsomething that users like but that we could envision forum trolls\ndismissing as a toy, it makes us especially likely to invest.<br/><br/>While young founders are at a disadvantage when coming up with\nmade-up ideas, they're the best source of organic ones, because\nthey're at the forefront of technology.  They use the latest stuff.\nThey only just decided what to use, so why wouldn't they?  And\nbecause they use the latest stuff, they're in a position to discover\nvaluable types of fixable brokenness first.<br/><br/>There's nothing more valuable than an unmet need that is just\nbecoming fixable.  If you find something broken that you can fix\nfor a lot of people, you've found a gold mine.  As with an actual\ngold mine, you still have to work hard to get the gold out of it.\nBut at least you know where the seam is, and that's the hard part.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nThis suggests a way to predict areas where Apple will be weak:\nthings Steve Jobs doesn't use.  E.g. I doubt he is much into gaming.<br/><br/>\n[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nIn retrospect, we should have <i>become</i> direct marketers.  If\nI were doing Viaweb again, I'd open our own online store.  If we\nhad, we'd have understood users a lot better.  I'd encourage anyone\nstarting a startup to become one of its users, however unnatural it\nseems.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nPossible exception: It's hard to compete directly with open source software.\nYou can build things for programmers, but there has to be some part\nyou can charge for.<br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, and Jessica Livingston\nfor reading drafts of this.<br/><br/></br></p></font>","date":"2010-04-01T00:00:00Z"}
