{"href":"angelinvesting.html","title":"How to Be an Angel Investor","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">March 2009<br/><br/><i>(This essay is derived from a talk at <a href=\"http://angelconf.org\">AngelConf</a>.)</i><br/><br/>When we sold our startup in 1998 I thought one day I'd do some angel\ninvesting.  Seven years later I still hadn't started.  I put it off\nbecause it seemed mysterious and complicated.   It turns out to be \neasier than I expected, and also more interesting.<br/><br/>The part I thought was hard, the mechanics of investing, really\nisn't. You give a startup money and they give you stock.  You'll\nprobably get either preferred stock, which means stock with extra\nrights like getting your money back first in a sale, or convertible\ndebt, which means (on paper) you're lending the company money, and\nthe debt converts to stock at the next sufficiently big funding\nround. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/angelinvesting.html#f1n\"><font color=\"#999999\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>There are sometimes minor tactical advantages to using one or the\nother.  The paperwork for convertible debt is simpler.  But really\nit doesn't matter much which you use.  Don't spend much time worrying\nabout the details of deal terms, especially when you first start\nangel investing.  That's not how you win at this game.  When you\nhear people talking about a successful angel investor, they're not\nsaying \"He got a 4x liquidation preference.\" They're saying \"He\ninvested in Google.\"<br/><br/>That's how you win: by investing in the right startups.  That is\nso much more important than anything else that I worry I'm misleading\nyou by even talking about other things.<br/><br/><b>Mechanics</b><br/><br/>Angel investors often syndicate deals, which means they join together\nto invest on the same terms.  In a syndicate there is usually a\n\"lead\" investor who negotiates the terms with the startup.  But not\nalways: sometimes the startup cobbles together a syndicate of\ninvestors who approach them independently, and the startup's lawyer\nsupplies the paperwork.<br/><br/>The easiest way to get started in angel investing is to find a\nfriend who already does it, and try to get included in his syndicates.\nThen all you have to do is write checks.<br/><br/>Don't feel like you have to join a syndicate, though.  It's not that\nhard to do it yourself.  You can just use the standard \n<a href=\"http://ycombinator.com/seriesaa.html\">series AA</a>\ndocuments Wilson Sonsini and Y Combinator published online.\nYou should of course have your lawyer review everything.  Both you\nand the startup should have lawyers.  But the lawyers don't have\nto create the agreement from scratch.  \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/angelinvesting.html#f2n\"><font color=\"#999999\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>\nWhen you negotiate terms with a startup, there are two numbers you\ncare about: how much money you're putting in, and the valuation of\nthe company.  The valuation determines how much stock you get.  If\nyou put $50,000 into a company at a pre-money valuation of $1\nmillion, then the post-money valuation is $1.05 million, and you\nget .05/1.05, or 4.76% of the company's stock.<br/><br/>If the company raises more money later, the new investor will take\na chunk of the company away from all the existing shareholders just\nas you did.  If in the next round they sell 10% of the company to\na new investor, your 4.76% will be reduced to 4.28%.<br/><br/>That's ok.  Dilution is normal.  What saves you from being mistreated\nin future rounds, usually, is that you're in the same boat as the\nfounders.  They can't dilute you without diluting themselves just\nas much.  And they won't dilute themselves unless they end up \n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/equity.html\">net ahead</a>.  So in theory, each further \nround of investment leaves you\nwith a smaller share of an even more valuable company, till after\nseveral more rounds you end up with .5% of the company at the point\nwhere it IPOs, and you are very happy because your $50,000 has\nbecome $5 million. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/angelinvesting.html#f3n\"><font color=\"#999999\">3</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The agreement by which you invest should have provisions that \nlet you contribute to\nfuture rounds to maintain your percentage.  So it's your choice\nwhether you get diluted.  \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/angelinvesting.html#f4n\"><font color=\"#999999\">4</font></a>]</font>\nIf the company does really well,\nyou eventually will, because eventually the valuations will get so\nhigh it's not worth it for you.<br/><br/>How much does an angel invest?  That varies enormously, from $10,000\nto hundreds of thousands or in rare cases even millions.  The upper\nbound is obviously the total amount the founders want to raise.\nThe lower bound is 5-10% of the total or $10,000, whichever\nis greater.  A typical angel round these days might be $150,000\nraised from 5 people.<br/><br/>Valuations don't vary as much.  For angel rounds it's rare to see\na valuation lower than half a million or higher than 4 or 5 million.\n4 million is starting to be VC territory.<br/><br/>How do you decide what valuation to offer?  If you're part of a\nround led by someone else, that problem is solved for you.  But\nwhat if you're investing by yourself?  There's no real answer.\nThere is no rational way to value an early stage startup.  The\nvaluation reflects nothing more than the strength of the company's\nbargaining position.  If they really want you, either because they\ndesperately need money, or you're someone who can help them a lot,\nthey'll let you invest at a low valuation.  If they don't need you,\nit will be higher.  So guess.  The startup may not have any more\nidea what the number should be than you do. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/angelinvesting.html#f5n\"><font color=\"#999999\">5</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Ultimately it doesn't matter much.  When angels make a lot of money\nfrom a deal, it's not because they invested at a valuation of $1.5\nmillion instead of $3 million.  It's because the company was really\nsuccessful.<br/><br/>I can't emphasize that too much.  Don't get hung up on mechanics\nor deal terms.  What you should spend your time thinking about is\nwhether the company is good.<br/><br/>(Similarly, founders also should not get hung up on deal\nterms, but should spend their time thinking about how to make the\ncompany good.)<br/><br/>There's a second less obvious component of an angel investment: how\nmuch you're expected to help the startup.  Like the amount you\ninvest, this can vary a lot.  You don't have to do anything if you\ndon't want to; you could simply be a source of money.  Or you can\nbecome a de facto employee of the company.  Just make sure that you\nand the startup agree in advance about roughly how much you'll do\nfor them.<br/><br/>Really hot companies sometimes have high standards for angels.  The\nones everyone wants to invest in practically audition investors,\nand only take money from people who are famous and/or will work\nhard for them.  But don't feel like you have to put in a lot of\ntime or you won't get to invest in any good startups.  There is a\nsurprising lack of correlation between how hot a deal a startup is\nand how well it ends up doing.  Lots of hot startups will end up\nfailing, and lots of startups no one likes will end up succeeding.\nAnd the latter are so desperate for money that they'll take it from\nanyone at a low valuation. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/angelinvesting.html#f6n\"><font color=\"#999999\">6</font></a>]</font><br/><br/><b>Picking Winners</b><br/><br/>It would be nice to be able to pick those out, wouldn't it?  The\npart of angel investing that has most effect on your returns, picking\nthe right companies, is also the hardest.  So you should practically\nignore (or more precisely, archive, in the Gmail sense) everything\nI've told you so far.  You may need to refer to it at some point,\nbut it is not the central issue.<br/><br/>The central issue is picking the right startups.  What \"Make something\npeople want\" is for startups, \"Pick the right startups\" is for\ninvestors.  Combined they yield \"Pick the startups that will make\nsomething people want.\"<br/><br/>How do you do that?  It's not as simple as picking startups that\nare already making something wildly popular.  By then it's\ntoo late for angels.  VCs will already be onto them.  As an angel,\nyou have to pick startups before they've got a hit—either\nbecause they've made something great but users don't realize it\nyet, like Google early on, or because they're still an iteration\nor two away from the big hit, like Paypal when they were making\nsoftware for transferring money between PDAs.<br/><br/>To be a good angel investor, you have to be a good judge of potential.\nThat's what it comes down to.  VCs can be fast followers.  Most of\nthem don't try to predict what will win.  They just try to notice\nquickly when something already is winning.  But angels have to be\nable to predict.  \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/angelinvesting.html#f7n\"><font color=\"#999999\">7</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>One interesting consequence of this fact is that there are a lot\nof people out there who have never even made an angel investment\nand yet are already better angel investors than they realize.\nSomeone who doesn't know the first thing about the mechanics of\nventure funding but knows what a successful startup founder looks\nlike is actually far ahead of someone who knows termsheets inside\nout, but thinks \n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/gba.html\">\"hacker\"</a> means someone who breaks into computers.\nIf you can recognize good startup founders by empathizing with\nthem—if you both resonate at the same frequency—then\nyou may already be a better startup picker than the median professional\nVC.  \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/angelinvesting.html#f8n\"><font color=\"#999999\">8</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Paul Buchheit, for example, started angel investing about a year\nafter me, and he was pretty much immediately as good as me at picking\nstartups.  My extra year of experience was rounding error compared\nto our ability to empathize with founders.<br/><br/>What makes a good founder?  If there were a word that meant the\nopposite of hapless, that would be the one.  Bad founders seem\nhapless.  They may be smart, or not, but somehow events overwhelm\nthem and they get discouraged and give up.  Good founders make\nthings happen the way they want.  Which is not to say they force\nthings to happen in a predefined way.  Good founders have a healthy\nrespect for reality.  But they are relentlessly resourceful.  That's\nthe closest I can get to the opposite of hapless.  You want to fund\npeople who are relentlessly resourceful.<br/><br/>Notice we started out talking about things, and now we're talking\nabout people.  There is an ongoing debate between investors which\nis more important, the people, or the idea—or more precisely,\nthe market. Some, like Ron Conway, say it's the people—that\nthe idea will change, but the people are the foundation of the\ncompany.  Whereas Marc Andreessen says he'd back ok founders in a\nhot market over great founders in a bad one.  \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/angelinvesting.html#f9n\"><font color=\"#999999\">9</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>These two positions are not so far apart as they seem, because good\npeople find good markets.  Bill Gates would probably have ended up\npretty rich even if IBM hadn't happened to drop the PC standard in\nhis lap.<br/><br/>I've thought a lot about the disagreement between the investors who\nprefer to bet on people and those who prefer to bet on markets.\nIt's kind of surprising that it even exists.  You'd expect opinions\nto have converged more.<br/><br/>But I think I've figured out what's going on.  The three most\nprominent people I know who favor markets are Marc, Jawed Karim,\nand Joe Kraus.  And all three of them, in their own startups,\nbasically flew into a thermal: they hit a market growing so fast\nthat it was all they could do to keep up with it.  That kind of\nexperience is hard to ignore.  Plus I think they underestimate\nthemselves: they think back to how easy it felt to ride that huge\nthermal upward, and they think \"anyone could have done it.\"  But\nthat isn't true; they are not ordinary people.<br/><br/>So as an angel investor I think you want to go with Ron Conway and\nbet on people.  Thermals happen, yes, but no one can predict\nthem—not even the founders, and certainly not you as an\ninvestor.  And only good people can ride the thermals if they hit\nthem anyway.<br/><br/><b>Deal Flow</b><br/><br/>Of course the question of how to choose startups presumes you\nhave startups to choose between.  How do you find them?  This is\nyet another problem that gets solved for you by syndicates.  If you\ntag along on a friend's investments, you don't have to find startups.<br/><br/>The problem is not finding startups, exactly, but finding a stream\nof reasonably high quality ones.  The traditional way to do this\nis through contacts.  If you're friends with a lot of investors and\nfounders, they'll send deals your way.  The Valley basically runs\non referrals.  And once you start to become known as reliable,\nuseful investor, people will refer lots of deals to you.  I certainly\nwill.<br/><br/>There's also a newer way to find startups, which is to come to\nevents like Y Combinator's Demo Day, where a batch of newly created\nstartups presents to investors all at once.   We have two Demo Days\na year, one in March and one in August.  These are basically mass\nreferrals.<br/><br/>But events like Demo Day only account for a fraction of matches\nbetween startups and investors.  The personal referral is still the\nmost common route.  So if you want to hear about new startups, the\nbest way to do it is to get lots of referrals.<br/><br/>The best way to get lots of referrals is to invest in startups.  No\nmatter how smart and nice you seem, insiders will be reluctant to\nsend you referrals until you've proven yourself by doing a couple\ninvestments.  Some smart, nice guys turn out to be flaky,\nhigh-maintenance investors. But once you prove yourself as a good\ninvestor, the deal flow, as they call it, will increase rapidly in\nboth quality and quantity.  At the extreme, for someone like Ron\nConway, it is basically identical with the deal flow of the whole\nValley.<br/><br/>So if you want to invest seriously, the way to get started is to\nbootstrap yourself off your existing connections, be a good investor\nin the startups you meet that way, and eventually you'll start a\nchain reaction.  Good investors are rare, even in Silicon Valley.\nThere probably aren't more than a couple hundred serious angels in the whole\nValley, and yet they're probably the single most important ingredient\nin making the Valley what it is.  Angels are the limiting reagent\nin startup formation.<br/><br/>If there are only a couple hundred serious angels in the Valley, \nthen by deciding to become one you could single-handedly make the pipeline\nfor startups in Silicon Valley significantly wider.  That is kind\nof mind-blowing.<br/><br/><b>Being Good</b><br/><br/>How do you be a good angel investor?  The first thing you need is\nto be decisive.  When we talk to founders about good and bad\ninvestors, one of the ways we describe the good ones is to say \"he\nwrites checks.\" That doesn't mean the investor says yes to everyone.\nFar from it.  It means he makes up his mind quickly,\nand follows through.  You may be thinking, how hard could that be?\nYou'll see when you try it.  It follows from the nature of angel\ninvesting that the decisions are hard.  You have to guess early,\nat the stage when the most promising ideas still seem counterintuitive,\nbecause if they were obviously good, VCs would already have funded\nthem.<br/><br/>Suppose it's 1998.  You come across a startup founded by a couple\ngrad students.  They say they're going to work on Internet search.\nThere are already a bunch of big public companies doing search.\nHow can these grad students possibly compete with them?  And does\nsearch even matter anyway?  All the search engines are trying to\nget people to start calling them \"portals\" instead.  Why would you\nwant to invest in a startup run by a couple of nobodies who are\ntrying to compete with large, aggressive companies in an area they\nthemselves have declared passe?  And yet the grad students seem\npretty smart.  What do you do?<br/><br/>There's a hack for being decisive when you're inexperienced: ratchet\ndown the size of your investment till it's an amount you wouldn't\ncare too much about losing.  For every rich person (you probably\nshouldn't try angel investing unless you think of yourself as rich)\nthere's some amount that would be painless, though annoying, to\nlose.  Till you feel comfortable investing, don't invest more than\nthat per startup.<br/><br/>For example, if you have $5 million in investable assets, it would\nprobably be painless (though annoying) to lose $15,000.  That's\nless than .3% of your net worth.  So start by making 3 or 4 $15,000\ninvestments.  Nothing will teach you about angel investing like\nexperience.  Treat the first few as an educational expense.  $60,000\nis less than a lot of graduate programs.  Plus you get equity.<br/><br/>What's really uncool is to be strategically indecisive: to string\nfounders along while trying to gather more information about the\nstartup's trajectory. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/angelinvesting.html#f10n\"><font color=\"#999999\">10</font></a>]</font>\n There's always a temptation to do that,\nbecause you just have so little to go on, but you have to consciously\nresist it.  In the long term it's to your advantage to be good.<br/><br/>The other component of being a good angel investor is simply to be\na good person.  Angel investing is not a business where you make\nmoney by screwing people over.  Startups create wealth, and\ncreating wealth is not a zero sum game.  No one has to lose for you\nto win.  In fact, if you mistreat the founders you invest in, they'll\njust get demoralized and the company will do worse.  Plus your\nreferrals will dry up.  So I recommend being good.<br/><br/>The most successful angel investors I know are all basically good\npeople.  Once they invest in a company, all they want to do is help\nit.  And they'll help people they haven't invested in too.  When\nthey do favors they don't seem to keep track of them.  It's too\nmuch overhead.  They just try to help everyone, and assume good\nthings will flow back to them somehow. Empirically that seems to\nwork.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nConvertible debt can be either capped at a particular valuation,\nor can be done at a discount to whatever the valuation turns out\nto be when it converts.  E.g. convertible debt at a discount of 30%\nmeans when it converts you get stock as if you'd invested at a 30%\nlower valuation.  That can be useful in cases where you can't or\ndon't want to figure out what the valuation should be.  You leave\nit to the next investor.  On the other hand, a lot of investors\nwant to know exactly what they're getting, so they will only do\nconvertible debt with a cap.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nThe expensive part of creating an agreement from scratch is\nnot writing the agreement, but bickering at several hundred\ndollars an hour over the details.  That's why the series AA paperwork\naims at a middle ground.  You can just start from the compromise\nyou'd have reached after lots of back and forth.<br/><br/>When you fund a startup, both your lawyers should be specialists\nin startups.  Do not use ordinary corporate lawyers for this.  Their\ninexperience makes them overbuild: they'll create huge, overcomplicated\nagreements, and spend hours arguing over irrelevant things.<br/><br/>In the Valley, the top startup law firms are Wilson Sonsini, Orrick,\nFenwick &amp; West, Gunderson Dettmer, and Cooley Godward.  In Boston\nthe best are Goodwin Procter, Wilmer Hale, and Foley Hoag.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nYour mileage may vary.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f4n\"><font color=\"#000000\">4</font></a>]\nThese anti-dilution provisions also protect you against\ntricks like a later investor trying to steal the company by doing\nanother round that values the company at $1.  If you have a competent\nstartup lawyer handle the deal for you, you should be protected\nagainst such tricks initially.  But it could become a problem later.\nIf a big VC firm wants to invest in the startup after you, they may\ntry to make you take out your anti-dilution protections.  And if\nthey do the startup will be pressuring you to agree.  They'll tell\nyou that if you don't, you're going to kill their deal with the VC.\nI recommend you solve this problem by having a gentlemen's agreement\nwith the founders: agree with them in advance that you're not going\nto give up your anti-dilution protections.  Then it's up to them\nto tell VCs early on.<br/><br/>The reason you don't want to give them up is the following scenario.\nThe VCs recapitalize the company, meaning they give it additional\nfunding at a pre-money valuation of zero.  This wipes out the\nexisting shareholders, including both you and the founders.  They\nthen grant the founders lots of options, because they need them to\nstay around, but you get nothing.<br/><br/>Obviously this is not a nice thing to do.  It doesn't happen often.\nBrand-name VCs wouldn't recapitalize a company just to steal a few\npercent from an angel.  But there's a continuum here.  A less\nupstanding, lower-tier VC might be tempted to do it to steal a big\nchunk of stock.<br/><br/>I'm not saying you should always absolutely refuse to give up your\nanti-dilution protections.  Everything is a negotiation.  If you're\npart of a powerful syndicate, you might be able to give up legal\nprotections and rely on social ones.  If you invest in a deal led\nby a big angel like Ron Conway, for example, you're pretty well\nprotected against being mistreated, because any VC would think twice\nbefore crossing him.  This kind of protection is one of the reasons\nangels like to invest in syndicates.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f5n\"><font color=\"#000000\">5</font></a>]\nDon't invest so much, or at such a low valuation, that you\nend up with an excessively large share of a startup, unless you're\nsure your money will be the last they ever need.  Later stage\ninvestors won't invest in a company if the founders don't have\nenough equity left to motivate them.  I talked to a VC recently who\nsaid he'd met with a company he really liked, but he turned\nthem down because investors already owned more than half of it.\nThose investors probably thought they'd been pretty clever by getting\nsuch a large chunk of this desirable company, but in fact they were\nshooting themselves in the foot.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f6n\"><font color=\"#000000\">6</font></a>]\nAt any given time I know of at least 3 or 4 YC alumni who I\nbelieve will be big successes but who are running on vapor,\nfinancially, because investors don't yet get what they're doing.\n(And no, unfortunately, I can't tell you who they are.  I can't\nrefer a startup to an investor I don't know.)<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f7n\"><font color=\"#000000\">7</font></a>]\nThere are some VCs who can predict instead of reacting.  Not\nsurprisingly, these are the most successful ones.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f8n\"><font color=\"#000000\">8</font></a>]\nIt's somewhat sneaky of me to put it this way, because the\nmedian VC loses money.  That's one of the most surprising things\nI've learned about VC while working on Y Combinator.  Only a fraction\nof VCs even have positive returns.  The rest exist to satisfy demand\namong fund managers for venture capital as an asset class.  Learning\nthis explained a lot about some of the VCs I encountered when we\nwere working on Viaweb.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f9n\"><font color=\"#000000\">9</font></a>]\nVCs also generally say they prefer great markets to great\npeople.  But what they're really saying is they want both.  They're\nso selective that they only even consider great people.  So when\nthey say they care above all about big markets, they mean that's\nhow they choose between great people.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f10n\"><font color=\"#000000\">10</font></a>]\nFounders rightly dislike the sort of investor who says he's\ninterested in investing but doesn't want to lead.  There are\ncircumstances where this is an acceptable excuse, but more often\nthan not what it means is \"No, but if you turn out to be a hot deal,\nI want to be able to claim retroactively I said yes.\"<br/><br/>If you like a startup enough to invest in it, then invest in it.\nJust use the standard <a href=\"http://ycombinator.com/seriesaa.html\">series \nAA</a> terms and write them a check.<br/><br/>\n<b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Jessica Livingston,\nRobert Morris, and Fred Wilson for reading drafts of this.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://ycombinator.com/images/y18.gif\"/>\n<a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=506671\">Comment</a> on this essay.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2009-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
