{"href":"tablets.html","title":"Tablets","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">December 2010<br/><br/>I was thinking recently how inconvenient it was not to have a general\nterm for iPhones, iPads, and the corresponding things running\nAndroid.  The closest to a general term seems to be \"mobile devices,\"\nbut that (a) applies to any mobile phone, and (b) doesn't really\ncapture what's distinctive about the iPad.<br/><br/>After a few seconds it struck me that what we'll end up calling\nthese things is tablets.  The only reason we even consider calling\nthem \"mobile devices\" is that the iPhone preceded the iPad.  If the\niPad had come first, we wouldn't think of the iPhone as a phone;\nwe'd think of it as a tablet small enough to hold up to your ear.<br/><br/>The iPhone isn't so much a phone as a replacement for a phone.\nThat's an important distinction, because it's an early instance of\nwhat will become a common pattern.  Many if not most of the\nspecial-purpose objects around us are going to be replaced by apps\nrunning on tablets.<br/><br/>This is already clear in cases like GPSes, music players, and\ncameras.  But I think it will surprise people how many things are\ngoing to get replaced.  We funded one startup that's \n<a href=\"http://lockitron.com/\">replacing keys</a>.\nThe fact that you can change font sizes easily means the iPad\neffectively replaces reading glasses.  I wouldn't be surprised if\nby playing some clever tricks with the accelerometer you could even\nreplace the bathroom scale.<br/><br/>The advantages of doing things in software on a single device are\nso great that everything that can get turned into software will.\nSo for the next couple years, a good <a href=\"http://ycombinator.com/rfs8.html\">recipe for startups</a>\nwill be to look around you for things that people haven't realized\nyet can be made unnecessary by a tablet app.<br/><br/>In 1938 Buckminster Fuller coined the term <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeralization\">ephemeralization</a> to\ndescribe the increasing tendency of physical machinery to be replaced\nby what we would now call software.  The reason tablets are going\nto take over the world is not (just) that Steve Jobs and Co are\nindustrial design wizards, but because they have this force behind\nthem.  The iPhone and the iPad have effectively drilled a hole that\nwill allow ephemeralization to flow into a lot of new areas.  No one\nwho has studied the history of technology would want to underestimate\nthe power of that force.<br/><br/>I worry about the power Apple could have with this force behind\nthem.  I don't want to see another era of client monoculture like\nthe Microsoft one in the 80s and 90s.  But if ephemeralization is\none of the main forces driving the spread of tablets, that suggests\na way to compete with Apple: be a better platform for it.<br/><br/>It has turned out to be a great thing that Apple tablets have\naccelerometers in them.  Developers have used the accelerometer in\nways Apple could never have imagined.  That's the nature of platforms.\nThe more versatile the tool, the less you can predict how people\nwill use it.  So tablet makers should be thinking: what else can\nwe put in there?  Not merely hardware, but software too.  What else\ncan we give developers access to?  Give hackers an inch and they'll\ntake you a mile.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Jessica Livingston, and\nRobert Morris for reading drafts of this.<br/><br/><!-- <b>Note:</b> The original version of this essay used the term\n\"etherealization\" instead of \"ephemeralization,\" but apparently\nthe former was an alternative name suggested to Fuller by \nsomeone else; he preferred the latter. --><br/><br/></font>","date":"2010-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
