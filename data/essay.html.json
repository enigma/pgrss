{"href":"essay.html","title":"The Age of the Essay","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">September 2004<br/><br/>Remember the essays you had to write in high school?\nTopic sentence, introductory paragraph,\nsupporting paragraphs, conclusion.  The conclusion being,\nsay, that Ahab in <i>Moby Dick</i> was a Christ-like figure.<br/><br/>Oy.  So I'm going to try to give the other side of the\nstory: what an essay really is, and how you write one.\nOr at least, how I write one.<br/><br/><b>Mods</b><br/><br/>The most obvious difference between real essays and\nthe things one has to write in school is that real\nessays are not exclusively about English literature.\nCertainly schools should teach students how to\nwrite.  But due to a series of historical accidents\nthe teaching of\nwriting has gotten mixed together with the study\nof literature.  And so all over the country students are\nwriting not about how a baseball team with a small budget\nmight compete with the Yankees, or the role of color in\nfashion, or what constitutes a good dessert, but about\nsymbolism in Dickens.<br/><br/>With the result that writing is made to seem boring and\npointless.  Who cares about symbolism in Dickens?\nDickens himself would be more interested in an essay\nabout color or baseball.<br/><br/>How did things get this way?  To answer that we have to go back\nalmost a thousand years.  Around 1100, Europe at last began to\ncatch its breath after centuries of chaos, and once they\nhad the luxury of curiosity they rediscovered\nwhat we call \"the classics.\"  The effect was rather as if\nwe were visited by beings from another solar system.\nThese earlier civilizations were so much more sophisticated\nthat for the next several centuries the main work of\nEuropean scholars, in almost every field, was to assimilate\nwhat they knew.<br/><br/>During this period the study of ancient texts acquired great\nprestige.  It seemed the essence of what scholars did.  As\nEuropean scholarship gained momentum it became less and less important;\nby 1350\nsomeone who wanted to learn about science could find better\nteachers than Aristotle in his own era. [1]\nBut schools change slower than scholarship.  In the\n19th century the study of ancient texts was still the backbone\nof the curriculum.<br/><br/>The time was then ripe for the question: if the study of\nancient texts is a valid field for scholarship, why not modern\ntexts?  The answer, of course, is that the original raison d'etre\nof classical scholarship was a kind of intellectual archaeology that\ndoes not need to be done in the case of contemporary authors.\nBut for obvious reasons no one wanted to give that answer.\nThe archaeological work being mostly done, it implied that\nthose studying the classics were, if not wasting their\ntime, at least working on problems of minor importance.<br/><br/>And so began the study of modern literature.  There was a good\ndeal of resistance at first.\nThe first courses in English literature\nseem to have been offered by the newer colleges, particularly\nAmerican ones.  Dartmouth, the University of Vermont, Amherst,\nand University College, London\ntaught English literature in the 1820s.\n<!--The newly founded University\nof London had the first professor of English language and literature\nin 1828, and Lafayette College the second in 1857.-->\nBut Harvard didn't have a professor of English literature until\n1876, and Oxford not till 1885. (Oxford had a chair of Chinese before\nit had one of English.) [2]<br/><br/>What tipped the scales, at least in the US, seems to have\nbeen the idea that professors should do research as well\nas teach.  This idea (along with the PhD, the department, and\nindeed the whole concept of the modern university) was imported\nfrom Germany in the late 19th century. Beginning at\nJohns Hopkins in 1876, the new model spread rapidly.<br/><br/>Writing was one of the casualties.  Colleges had long taught\nEnglish composition.  But how do you do research on composition?\nThe professors who taught math could be required to do original\nmath, the professors who taught history could be required to\nwrite scholarly articles about history, but what about the  \nprofessors who taught rhetoric or composition?  What should they\ndo research on?  The closest thing seemed to be English literature. [3]<br/><br/>And so in the late 19th century the teaching of writing was inherited\nby English professors.  This had two drawbacks:\n(a) an expert on literature need not himself be a good writer,\nany more than an art historian has to be a good painter, and (b)\nthe subject of writing now tends to be literature, since that's\nwhat the professor is interested in.<br/><br/>High schools imitate universities.  The seeds of our miserable\nhigh school experiences were sown in 1892, when\nthe National Education Association\n\"formally recommended that literature\nand composition be unified in the high school course.\" [4]\nThe 'riting component of the 3 Rs then morphed into English,\nwith the bizarre consequence that high school students now\nhad to write about English literature-- to write, without\neven realizing it, imitations of whatever\nEnglish professors had been publishing in their journals a   \nfew decades before.<br/><br/>It's no wonder if this seems to the\nstudent a pointless exercise, because we're now three steps\nremoved from real work: the students are imitating English\nprofessors, who are imitating classical scholars, who are\nmerely the inheritors of a tradition growing out of what\nwas, 700 years ago, fascinating and urgently needed work.<br/><br/><b>No Defense</b><br/><br/>The other big difference between a real essay and the things\nthey make you write in school is that a real essay doesn't\ntake a position and then defend it.  That principle,\nlike the idea that we ought to be writing about literature,\nturns out to be another intellectual hangover of long\nforgotten origins.<br/><br/>It's often mistakenly believed that\nmedieval universities were mostly seminaries.  In fact they\nwere more law schools.  And at least in our tradition\nlawyers are advocates, trained to take\neither side of an argument and make as good a case for it\nas they can.\nWhether cause or effect, this spirit pervaded\nearly universities.  The study of rhetoric, the art of arguing\npersuasively, was a third of the undergraduate curriculum. [5]\nAnd after the lecture the most common form\nof discussion was the disputation.  This is at least\nnominally preserved in our present-day thesis defense:\nmost people treat the words thesis\nand dissertation as interchangeable, but originally, at least,\na thesis was a position one took and the dissertation was\nthe argument by which one defended it.<br/><br/>Defending a position may be a necessary evil in a\nlegal dispute, but it's not the best way to get at the truth,\nas I think lawyers would be the first to admit.  It's not\njust that you miss subtleties this way.\nThe real problem is that you can't change the question.<br/><br/>And yet this principle is built into the very structure of\nthe things they teach you to write in high school.  The topic  \nsentence is your thesis, chosen in advance, the supporting\nparagraphs the blows you strike in the conflict, and the\nconclusion-- uh, what is the conclusion?  I was never sure\nabout that in high school.  It seemed as if we were just\nsupposed to restate what we said in the first paragraph,\nbut in different enough words that no one could tell.\nWhy bother?\nBut when you understand the origins\nof this sort of \"essay,\" you can see where the\nconclusion comes from.  It's the concluding remarks to the   \njury.<br/><br/>Good writing should be convincing, certainly, but it\nshould be convincing because you got the right answers,\nnot because you did a good job of arguing.  When I give a \ndraft of an essay to friends, there are two things\nI want to know: which parts bore them, and which seem   \nunconvincing.  The boring bits can usually be fixed by   \ncutting.  But I don't try to fix the unconvincing bits by\narguing more cleverly.  I need to talk the matter over.<br/><br/>At the very least I must have explained something badly.  In\nthat case, in the course of the conversation I'll be forced\nto come up a with a clearer explanation, which I can just\nincorporate in the essay.  More often than not I have\nto change what I was saying as well.\nBut the aim is never to be convincing per se.\nAs the reader gets smarter, convincing and true become identical,\nso if I can convince smart readers I must be near the truth.<br/><br/>The sort of writing that attempts to persuade may be\na valid (or at least inevitable) form, but it's historically\ninaccurate to call it an essay.  An essay is \nsomething else.<br/><br/><b>Trying</b><br/><br/>To understand what a real essay is, we have to\nreach back into history again, though this time not so far.\nTo Michel de Montaigne, who in 1580 published a book of\nwhat he called \"essais.\" He was\ndoing something quite different from what lawyers do, and\nthe difference is embodied in the name.  <i>Essayer</i> is the French\nverb meaning \"to try\"\nand an <i>essai</i> is an attempt.  An essay is something you\nwrite to try to figure something out.<br/><br/>Figure out what?  You don't know yet.  And so you can't begin with a\nthesis, because you don't have one, and may never have\none.  An essay doesn't begin with a statement, but with a\nquestion.  In a real essay, you don't take a position and\ndefend it.  You notice a door that's ajar, and you open it and\nwalk in to see what's inside.<br/><br/>If all you want to do is figure things out, why do you need\nto write anything, though?  Why not just sit and think?  Well,\nthere precisely is Montaigne's great discovery.  Expressing    \nideas helps to form them.  Indeed, helps is far too weak a\nword.  Most of what ends up in my essays I only\nthought of when I sat down to write them.  That's why I   \nwrite them.<br/><br/>In the things you write in school you are, in theory,\nmerely explaining yourself to the reader.\nIn a real essay you're writing for yourself.\nYou're thinking out loud.<br/><br/>But not quite.\nJust as inviting people over forces you to\nclean up your apartment, writing something that\nother people will read forces you to think well.  So it\ndoes matter to have an audience.  The things I've written\njust for myself are no good.\nThey tend to peter out.  When I run into\ndifficulties, I find I conclude with a few vague\nquestions and then drift off to get a cup of tea.<br/><br/>Many published essays peter out in the same way.\nParticularly the sort written by the staff writers \nof newsmagazines.  Outside writers tend to supply\neditorials of the defend-a-position variety, which\nmake a beeline toward a rousing (and\nforeordained) conclusion.   But the staff writers feel\nobliged to write something \"balanced.\"\nSince they're writing for a popular magazine, they start with the\nmost radioactively controversial questions, from which-- because\nthey're writing for a popular magazine-- they\nthen proceed to recoil in terror.\nAbortion, for or against?\nThis group says one thing.  That group says\nanother.  One thing is certain: the question is a\ncomplex one.  (But don't get mad at us.  We didn't\ndraw any conclusions.)<br/><br/><b>The River</b><br/><br/>Questions aren't enough.  An essay has to come up with answers.\nThey don't always, of course.  Sometimes you start with a\npromising question and get nowhere.  But those you don't   \npublish.  Those are like experiments that get inconclusive\nresults.   An essay you publish ought to tell the reader       \nsomething he didn't already know.<br/><br/>But <i>what</i> you tell him doesn't matter, so long as    \nit's interesting.  I'm sometimes accused of meandering.\nIn defend-a-position writing that would be a flaw.\nThere you're not concerned with truth.  You already\nknow where you're going, and you want to go straight there,\nblustering through obstacles, and hand-waving\nyour way across swampy ground.  But that's not what\nyou're trying to do in an essay.  An essay is supposed to\nbe a search for truth.  It would be suspicious if it didn't\nmeander.<br/><br/>The Meander (aka Menderes) is a river in Turkey.\nAs you might expect, it winds all over the place.\nBut it doesn't do this out of frivolity.\nThe path it has discovered is the most\neconomical route to the sea. [6]<br/><br/>The river's algorithm is simple.  At each step, flow down.\nFor the essayist this translates to: flow interesting.   \nOf all the places to go next, choose the most interesting.\nOne can't have quite as little foresight as a river.  I always\nknow generally what I want to write about.\nBut not the\nspecific conclusions I want to reach; from paragraph to\nparagraph I let the ideas take their course.<br/><br/>This doesn't always work.  Sometimes, like a river,\none runs up against a wall.  Then I do the same thing the river does:\nbacktrack.  At one point in this essay\nI found that after following a certain thread I ran out\nof ideas.  I had to go back seven paragraphs and start over\nin another direction.<br/><br/>Fundamentally an essay is a train of thought-- but a cleaned-up\ntrain of thought, as dialogue is cleaned-up conversation.\nReal thought, like real conversation, is full of false starts.\nIt would be exhausting to read.  You need to \ncut and fill to\nemphasize the central thread, like an\nillustrator inking over a pencil drawing.  But don't\nchange so much that you lose the spontaneity of the original.<br/><br/>Err on the side of the river.  An essay is not a reference\nwork.  It's not something you read looking for a specific\nanswer, and feel cheated if you don't find it.  I'd much\nrather read an essay that went off in an unexpected but\ninteresting direction than one that plodded dutifully along\na prescribed course.<br/><br/><b>Surprise</b><br/><br/>So what's interesting?  For me, interesting means surprise.\nInterfaces, as Geoffrey James has said, should follow the principle of\nleast astonishment.   A button that looks like it will make a\nmachine stop should make it stop, not speed up.  Essays    \nshould do the opposite.  Essays should aim for maximum\nsurprise.<br/><br/>I was afraid of flying for a long time and could only travel\nvicariously.  When friends came back from faraway places,\nit wasn't just out of politeness that I asked\nwhat they saw.  I really wanted to know.  And I found\nthe best way to get information out of them was to ask\nwhat surprised them.  How was the place different from what\nthey expected?  This is an extremely useful question.\nYou can ask it of the most unobservant people, and it will \nextract information they didn't even know they were\nrecording.<br/><br/>Surprises are things that you not only didn't know, but that\ncontradict things you\nthought you knew.  And so they're the most valuable sort of\nfact you can get.  They're like a food that's not merely\nhealthy, but counteracts the unhealthy effects of things\nyou've already eaten.<br/><br/>How do you find surprises?  Well, therein lies half\nthe work of essay writing.  (The other half is expressing\nyourself well.)   The trick is to use yourself as a\nproxy for the reader.  You should only write about things\nyou've thought about a lot.  And anything you come across\nthat surprises you, who've thought about the topic a lot,\nwill probably surprise most readers.<br/><br/>For example, in a recent \n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/gh.html\">essay</a> I pointed out that because\nyou can only judge computer programmers by working with\nthem, no one knows who the best programmers are overall.\nI didn't realize this when I began\nthat essay, and even now I find it kind of weird.  That's\nwhat you're looking for.<br/><br/>So if you want to write essays, you need two ingredients:\na few topics you've thought about a lot, and\nsome ability to ferret out the unexpected.<br/><br/>What should you think about?  My guess is that it\ndoesn't matter-- that anything can be interesting if you get deeply\nenough into it.  One possible exception might be things\nthat have deliberately had all the variation sucked out of them,\nlike working in fast food.  In retrospect, was there\nanything interesting about working at Baskin-Robbins?\nWell, it was interesting how important color was\nto the customers.  Kids a certain age would point into\nthe case and say that they wanted yellow.  Did they want \nFrench Vanilla or Lemon?  They would just look at you   \nblankly.  They wanted yellow.  And then there was the  \nmystery of why the perennial favorite Pralines 'n' Cream   \nwas so appealing.  (I think now it was the salt.)\n<!--And the mystery of why Passion Fruit tasted so awful.\nPeople would order it because of the name, and were always\ndisappointed.-->\nAnd the difference in the way fathers and\nmothers bought ice cream for their kids: the fathers\nlike benevolent kings bestowing largesse, the mothers\nharried, giving in to pressure.\nSo, yes, there does seem to be some material even in\nfast food.<br/><br/>I didn't notice those things at the time, though.  At sixteen\nI was about as observant as a lump of rock.  I can see more now in\nthe fragments of memory I preserve of that age than I could see\nat the time from having it all happening live, right in front of me.<br/><br/><b>Observation</b><br/><br/>So the ability to ferret out the unexpected must not merely be an\ninborn one.  It must be something you can learn.\nHow do you learn it?<br/><br/>To some extent it's like learning history.\nWhen you first read\nhistory, it's just a whirl of names\nand dates.  \nNothing seems to stick.  But the more you learn, the more hooks you have\nfor new facts to stick onto-- which means\nyou accumulate knowledge at an exponential rate.  Once you\nremember that Normans conquered\nEngland in 1066, it will catch your attention when you hear\nthat other Normans conquered southern Italy at about the same time.\nWhich will make you wonder about Normandy, and take note\nwhen a third book mentions that Normans\nwere not, like most of what is now\ncalled France, tribes that flowed in as the Roman empire collapsed,\nbut Vikings (norman = north man) who arrived\nfour centuries later in 911.  Which makes\nit easier to remember that Dublin was also established by\nVikings in the 840s.  Etc, etc squared.<br/><br/>Collecting surprises is a similar process.\nThe more anomalies you've seen, the more easily you'll notice\nnew ones.   Which means, oddly enough, that as you grow older,\nlife should become more and more surprising.  When I was a\nkid, I used to think adults had it all figured out.\nI had it backwards.  Kids are the ones who have it all figured  \nout.  They're just mistaken.<br/><br/>When it comes to surprises, the rich get richer.  But\n(as with wealth) there\nmay be habits of mind that will help the process along.  It's\ngood to have a habit of asking questions, especially questions\nbeginning with Why.\nBut not in the random way that three year\nolds ask why.  There are an infinite number of questions.\nHow do you find the fruitful ones?<br/><br/>I find it especially\nuseful to ask why about things that seem wrong.\nFor example, why should there be a connection between\nhumor and misfortune?  Why do we find it funny when a\ncharacter, even one we like, slips on a banana peel?\nThere's a whole essay's worth of surprises there for sure.<br/><br/>If you want to notice things that seem wrong, you'll find a\ndegree of skepticism helpful.  I take it as an axiom\nthat we're only achieving 1% of what we could.\nThis helps counteract the rule that gets beaten into our\nheads as children: that things are the way they are because\nthat is how things have to be.\nFor example, everyone I've talked to while writing this essay  \nfelt the same about\nEnglish classes-- that the whole process seemed pointless.\nBut none of us had the balls at the time to hypothesize that\nit was, in fact, all a mistake.\nWe all thought there was just something we weren't getting.<br/><br/>I have a hunch you want to pay attention not just to things\nthat seem wrong, but things that seem wrong in a humorous way.  \nI'm always pleased when I see someone laugh as they\nread a draft of an essay.  But why should I be?  I'm aiming\nfor good ideas.  Why should good ideas be funny?\nThe connection may be surprise.\nSurprises make us laugh, and surprises are what\none wants to deliver.<br/><br/>I write down things that surprise me in notebooks.  I never\nactually get around to reading them and using\nwhat I've written, but I do tend to\nreproduce the same thoughts later.  So the main value\nof notebooks may be what writing things down leaves in your\nhead.<br/><br/>People trying to be cool will find themselves at a disadvantage\nwhen collecting surprises.  To be surprised is to be mistaken.\nAnd the essence of cool, as any fourteen year old could tell\nyou, is <i>nil admirari.</i>  When you're mistaken, don't\ndwell on it; just act like nothing's wrong and maybe no one\nwill notice.<br/><br/>One of the keys to coolness is to avoid situations where\ninexperience may make you look foolish. \nIf you want to find surprises you should do the opposite.\nStudy lots of different things,\nbecause some of the most interesting surprises are unexpected\nconnections between different fields.  For example, \njam, bacon, pickles, and cheese, which are among the most pleasing\nof foods, were all originally intended as methods of preservation.\nAnd so were books and paintings.<br/><br/>Whatever you study, include history-- but social and economic\nhistory, not political history.  History seems to me so important\nthat it's misleading to treat it as a mere field of study.\nAnother way to describe it is <i>all the data we have so far.</i><br/><br/>Among other things, studying history gives one confidence that\nthere are good ideas waiting to be discovered right under our noses.\nSwords evolved during the Bronze Age out of daggers, which\n(like their flint predecessors) had a hilt separate from the\nblade.  Because swords are longer\nthe hilts kept breaking off.  But it took five hundred years\nbefore someone thought of casting hilt and blade as one\npiece.<br/><br/><b>Disobedience</b><br/><br/>Above all, make a habit of paying\nattention to things you're not supposed to, either because \nthey're \"<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/say.html\">inappropriate</a>,\" \nor not important, or not what you're\nsupposed to be working on.  If you're curious about something,\ntrust your instincts.\nFollow the threads that attract your\nattention.  If there's something you're really interested\nin, you'll find they have an uncanny way of leading back to\nit anyway, just as the conversation of people who are especially\nproud of something always tends to lead back to it.<br/><br/>For example, I've always been fascinated by comb-overs, especially\nthe extreme sort that\nmake a man look as if he's wearing a beret made of his own hair.\nSurely this is a lowly sort of thing to be interested in-- the\nsort of superficial quizzing\nbest left to teenage girls.  And yet there is something underneath.\nThe key question, I realized, is how does the comber-over not\nsee how odd he looks?\nAnd the answer is that he got to look that way <i>incrementally.</i>\nWhat began as combing his hair a little carefully over a\nthin patch has gradually, over 20 years, grown into a monstrosity.\nGradualness is very powerful.  And that power can be\nused for constructive purposes too: just as you can trick\nyourself into looking like a freak, you can trick yourself into\ncreating something so grand that you would never have dared to\n<i>plan</i> such a thing.  Indeed, this is just how most good\nsoftware gets created.  You start by writing a stripped-down\nkernel (how hard can it be?) and gradually it grows\ninto a complete operating system.  Hence the next leap: could\nyou do the same thing in painting, or in a novel?<br/><br/>See what you can extract from a frivolous question?\nIf there's one piece of advice I would give about writing essays,\nit would be: don't do as you're told.\nDon't believe what you're supposed to.\nDon't write the\nessay readers expect; one learns nothing from\nwhat one expects.\nAnd\ndon't write the way they taught you to in school.<br/><br/>The most important sort of disobedience is to write\nessays at all.  Fortunately, this sort of disobedience shows\nsigns of becoming \n<a href=\"http://www.ojr.org/ojr/glaser/1056050270.php\">rampant</a>. \nIt used to be that only a tiny\nnumber of officially approved writers were allowed to\nwrite essays.  Magazines published few of them, and judged\nthem less by what they said than who wrote them;\na magazine might publish a story by an\nunknown writer if it was good enough, but if they published\nan essay on x it had to be by someone who was at least\nforty and whose job title had x in it.  Which is a problem,\nbecause there are a lot of things insiders can't say precisely\nbecause they're insiders.<br/><br/>The Internet is changing that.\nAnyone can publish an essay on the Web, and it gets judged, as any\nwriting should, by what it says, not who wrote it.\nWho are you to write about x?  You are whatever you wrote.<br/><br/>Popular magazines made the period between the spread\nof literacy and the arrival of TV the golden age of the\nshort story.\nThe Web may well make this the golden age of the essay.\nAnd that's certainly not something I realized when\nI started writing this.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[1] I'm thinking of Oresme (c. 1323-82).  But it's hard to pick\na date, because there was a sudden drop-off in scholarship\njust as Europeans finished assimilating classical science.\nThe cause may have been the plague of 1347; the trend in\nscientific progress matches the population curve.<br/><br/>[2] Parker, William R. \"Where Do College English Departments\nCome From?\" <i>College English</i> 28 (1966-67), pp. 339-351.\nReprinted in Gray, Donald J.
