{"href":"alien.html","title":"Alien Truth","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">October 2022<br/><br/>If there were intelligent beings elsewhere in the universe, they'd\nshare certain truths in common with us. The truths of mathematics\nwould be the same, because they're true by definition. Ditto for\nthe truths of physics; the mass of a carbon atom would be the same\non their planet. But I think we'd share other truths with aliens\nbesides the truths of math and physics, and that it would be\nworthwhile to think about what these might be.<br/><br/>For example, I think we'd share the principle that a controlled\nexperiment testing some hypothesis entitles us to have proportionally\nincreased belief in it. It seems fairly likely, too, that it would\nbe true for aliens that one can get better at something by practicing.\nWe'd probably share Occam's razor. There doesn't seem anything\nspecifically human about any of these ideas.<br/><br/>We can only guess, of course. We can't say for sure what forms\nintelligent life might take. Nor is it my goal here to explore that\nquestion, interesting though it is. The point of the idea of alien\ntruth is not that it gives us a way to speculate about what forms\nintelligent life might take, but that it gives us a threshold, or\nmore precisely a target, for truth. If you're trying to find the\nmost general truths short of those of math or physics, then presumably\nthey'll be those we'd share in common with other forms of intelligent\nlife.<br/><br/>Alien truth will work best as a heuristic if we err on the side of\ngenerosity. If an idea might plausibly be relevant to aliens, that's\nenough. Justice, for example. I wouldn't want to bet that all\nintelligent beings would understand the concept of justice, but I\nwouldn't want to bet against it either.<br/><br/>The idea of alien truth is related to Erdos's idea of God's book.\nHe used to describe a particularly good proof as being in God's\nbook, the implication being (a) that a sufficiently good proof was\nmore discovered than invented, and (b) that its goodness would be\nuniversally recognized. If there's such a thing as alien truth,\nthen there's more in God's book than math.<br/><br/>What should we call the search for alien truth? The obvious choice\nis \"philosophy.\" Whatever else philosophy includes, it should\nprobably include this. I'm fairly sure Aristotle would have thought\nso. One could even make the case that the search for alien truth\nis, if not an accurate description <i>of</i> philosophy, a good\ndefinition <i>for</i> it. I.e. that it's what people who call\nthemselves philosophers should be doing, whether or not they currently\nare. But I'm not wedded to that; doing it is what matters, not what\nwe call it.<br/><br/>We may one day have something like alien life among us in the form\nof AIs. And that may in turn allow us to be precise about what\ntruths an intelligent being would have to share with us. We might\nfind, for example, that it's impossible to create something we'd\nconsider intelligent that doesn't use Occam's razor. We might one\nday even be able to prove that. But though this sort of research\nwould be very interesting, it's not necessary for our purposes, or\neven the same field; the goal of philosophy, if we're going to call it that, would be\nto see what ideas we come up with using alien truth as a target,\nnot to say precisely where the threshold of it is. Those two questions might one\nday converge, but they'll converge from quite different directions,\nand till they do, it would be too constraining to restrict ourselves\nto thinking only about things we're certain would be alien truths.\nEspecially since this will probably be one of those areas where the\nbest guesses turn out to be surprisingly close to optimal. (Let's\nsee if that one does.)<br/><br/>Whatever we call it, the attempt to discover alien truths would be\na worthwhile undertaking. And curiously enough, that is itself\nprobably an alien truth.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><font color=\"888888\"><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Greg Brockman, \nPatrick Collison, Robert Morris, and Michael Nielsen for reading drafts of this.</font><br/><br/></font>","date":"2022-10-01T00:00:00Z"}
