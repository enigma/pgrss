{"href":"read.html","title":"The Need to Read","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">November 2022<br/><br/>In the science fiction books I read as a kid, reading had often\nbeen replaced by some more efficient way of acquiring knowledge.\nMysterious \"tapes\" would load it into one's brain like a program\nbeing loaded into a computer.<br/><br/>That sort of thing is unlikely to happen anytime soon. Not just\nbecause it would be hard to build a replacement for reading, but\nbecause even if one existed, it would be insufficient. Reading about\nx doesn't just teach you about x; it also teaches you how to write.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"#f1n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Would that matter? If we replaced reading, would anyone need to be\ngood at writing?<br/><br/>The reason it would matter is that writing is not just a way to\nconvey ideas, but also a way to have them.<br/><br/>A good writer doesn't just think, and then write down what he\nthought, as a sort of transcript. A good writer will almost always\ndiscover new things in the process of writing. And there is, as far\nas I know, no substitute for this kind of discovery. Talking about\nyour ideas with other people is a good way to develop them. But\neven after doing this, you'll find you still discover new things\nwhen you sit down to write. There is a kind of thinking that can\nonly be done by <a href=\"words.html\"><u>writing</u></a>.<br/><br/>There are of course kinds of thinking that can be done without\nwriting. If you don't need to go too deeply into a problem, you can\nsolve it without writing. If you're thinking about how two pieces\nof machinery should fit together, writing about it probably won't\nhelp much. And when a problem can be described formally, you can\nsometimes solve it in your head. But if you need to solve a\ncomplicated, ill-defined problem, it will almost always help to\nwrite about it. Which in turn means that someone who's not good at\nwriting will almost always be at a disadvantage in solving such\nproblems.<br/><br/>You can't think well without writing well, and you can't write well\nwithout reading well. And I mean that last \"well\" in both senses.\nYou have to be good at reading, and read good things.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"#f2n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>People who just want information may find other ways to get it.\nBut people who want to have ideas can't afford to.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nAudiobooks can give you examples of good writing, but having\nthem read to you doesn't teach you as much about writing as reading\nthem yourself.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nBy \"good at reading\" I don't mean good at the mechanics of\nreading. You don't have to be good at extracting words from the\npage so much as extracting meaning from the words.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2022-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
