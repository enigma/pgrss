That may seem a strange question, but it's not\nmeaningless or unanswerable. It's the sort of question kids ask\nbefore they learn not to ask big questions. I only came across it\nmyself in the process of investigating something else. But once I\ndid, I thought I should at least try to answer it.<br/><br/>So what <i>should</i> one do? One should help people, and take care of\nthe world. Those two are obvious. But is there anything else? When\nI ask that, the answer that pops up is <i>Make good new things</i>.<br/><br/>I can't prove that one should do this, any more than I can prove\nthat one should help people or take care of the world. We're talking\nabout first principles here. But I can explain why this principle\nmakes sense. The most impressive thing humans can do is to think.\nIt may be the most impressive thing that can be done. And the best\nkind of thinking, or more precisely the best proof that one has\nthought well, is to make good new things.<br/><br/>I mean new things in a very general sense. Newton's physics was a\ngood new thing. Indeed, the first version of this principle was to\nhave good new ideas. But that didn't seem general enough: it didn't\ninclude making art or music, for example, except insofar as they\nembody new ideas. And while they may embody new ideas, that's not\nall they embody, unless you stretch the word \"idea\" so uselessly\nthin that it includes everything that goes through your nervous\nsystem.<br/><br/>Even for ideas that one has consciously, though, I prefer the\nphrasing \"make good new things.\" There are other ways to describe\nthe best kind of thinking. To make discoveries, for example, or to\nunderstand something more deeply than others have. But how well do\nyou understand something if you can't make a model of it, or write\nabout it? Indeed, trying to express what you understand is not just\na way to prove that you understand it, but a way to understand it\nbetter.<br/><br/>Another reason I like this phrasing is that it biases us toward\ncreation. It causes us to prefer the kind of ideas that are naturally\nseen as making things rather than, say, making critical observations\nabout things other people have made. Those are ideas too, and\nsometimes valuable ones, but it's easy to trick oneself into believing\nthey're more valuable than they are. Criticism seems sophisticated,\nand making new things often seems awkward, especially at first; and\nyet it's precisely those first steps that are most rare and valuable.<br/><br/>Is newness essential? I think so. Obviously it's essential in\nscience. If you copied a paper of someone else's and published it\nas your own, it would seem not merely unimpressive but dishonest.\nAnd it's similar in the arts. A copy of a good painting can be a\npleasing thing, but it's not impressive in the way the original\nwas. Which in turn implies it's not impressive to make the same\nthing over and over, however well; you're just copying yourself.<br/><br/>Note though that we're talking about a different kind of should\nwith this principle. Taking care of people and the world are shoulds\nin the sense that they're one's duty, but making good new things\nis a should in the sense that this is how to live to one's full\npotential. Historically most rules about how to live have been a\nmix of both kinds of should, though usually with more of the former\nthan the latter. \n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"#f1n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>For most of history the question \"What should one do?\" got much the\nsame answer everywhere, whether you asked Cicero or Confucius. You\nshould be wise, brave, honest, temperate, and just, uphold tradition,\nand serve the public interest. There was a long stretch where in\nsome parts of the world the answer became \"Serve God,\" but in\npractice it was still considered good to be wise, brave, honest,\ntemperate, and just, uphold tradition, and serve the public interest.\nAnd indeed this recipe would have seemed right to most Victorians.\nBut there's nothing in it about taking care of the world or making\nnew things, and that's a bit worrying, because it seems like this\nquestion should be a timeless one. The answer shouldn't change much.<br/><br/>I'm not too worried that the traditional answers don't mention\ntaking care of the world. Obviously people only started to care\nabout that once it became clear we could ruin it. But how can making\ngood new things be important if the traditional answers don't mention\nit?<br/><br/>The traditional answers were answers to a slightly different question.\nThey were answers to the question of how to be, rather than what\nto do. The audience didn't have a lot of choice about what to do.\nThe audience up till recent centuries was the landowning class,\nwhich was also the political class. They weren't choosing between\ndoing physics and writing novels. Their work was foreordained:\nmanage their estates, participate in politics, fight when necessary.\nIt was ok to do certain other kinds of work in one's spare time,\nbut ideally one didn't have any. Cicero's <i>De Officiis</i> is one of the\ngreat classical answers to the question of how to live, and in it\nhe explicitly says that he wouldn't even be writing it if he hadn't\nbeen excluded from public life by recent political upheavals.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"#f2n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>There were of course people doing what we would now call \"original\nwork,\" and they were often admired for it, but they weren't seen\nas models. Archimedes knew that he was the first to prove that a\nsphere has 2/3 the volume of the smallest enclosing cylinder and\nwas very pleased about it. But you don't find ancient writers urging\ntheir readers to emulate him. They regarded him more as a prodigy\nthan a model.<br/><br/>Now many more of us can follow Archimedes's example and devote most\nof our attention to one kind of work. He turned out to be a model\nafter all, along with a collection of other people that his\ncontemporaries would have found it strange to treat as a distinct\ngroup, because the vein of people making new things ran at right\nangles to the social hierarchy.<br/><br/>What kinds of new things count? I'd rather leave that question to\nthe makers of them. It would be a risky business to try to define\nany kind of threshold, because new kinds of work are often despised\nat first. Raymond Chandler was writing literal pulp fiction, and\nhe's now recognized as one of the best writers of the twentieth\ncentury. Indeed this pattern is so common that you can use it as a\nrecipe: if you're excited about some kind of work that's not\nconsidered prestigious and you can explain what everyone else is\noverlooking about it, then this is not merely a kind of work that's\nok to do, but one to seek out.<br/><br/>The other reason I wouldn't want to define any thresholds is that\nwe don't need them. The kind of people who make good new things \ndon't need rules to keep them honest.<br/><br/>So there's my guess at a set of principles to live by: take care\nof people and the world, and make good new things. Different people\nwill do these to varying degrees. There will presumably be lots who\nfocus entirely on taking care of people. There will be a few who\nfocus mostly on making new things. But even if you're one of those,\nyou should at least make sure that the new things you make don't\nnet <i>harm</i> people or the world. And if you go a step further and\ntry to make things that help them, you may find you're ahead on the\ntrade. You'll be more constrained in what you can make, but you'll\nmake it with more energy.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if you make something amazing, you'll often be\nhelping people or the world even if you didn't mean to. Newton was\ndriven by curiosity and ambition, not by any practical effect his\nwork might have, and yet the practical effect of his work has been\nenormous. And this seems the rule rather than the exception. So\nif you think you can make something amazing, you should probably\njust go ahead and do it.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nWe could treat all three as the same kind of should by saying\nthat it's one's duty to live well â€” for example by saying, as some\nChristians have, that it's one's duty to make the most of one's\nGod-given gifts. But this seems one of those casuistries people\ninvented to evade the stern requirements of religion: it was permissible to\nspend time studying math instead of praying or performing acts of\ncharity because otherwise you were rejecting a gift God had given\nyou. A useful casuistry no doubt, but we don't need it.<br/><br/>We could also combine the first two principles, since people are\npart of the world. Why should our species get special treatment?\nI won't try to justify this choice, but I'm skeptical that anyone\nwho claims to think differently actually lives according to their\nprinciples.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nConfucius was also excluded from public life after ending up\non the losing end of a power struggle, and presumably he too would\nnot be so famous now if it hadn't been for this long stretch of\nenforced leisure.<br/><br/><br/><br/><font color=\"888888\"><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica \nLivingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.</font><br/><br/></font>","date":"2025-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
