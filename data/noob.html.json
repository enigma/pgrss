{"href":"noob.html","title":"Being a Noob","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">January 2020<br/><br/>When I was young, I thought old people had everything figured out.\nNow that I'm old, I know this isn't true.<br/><br/>I constantly feel like a noob. It seems like I'm always talking to\nsome startup working in a new field I know nothing about, or reading\na book about a topic I don't understand well enough, or visiting some new\ncountry where I don't know how things work.<br/><br/>It's not pleasant to feel like a noob. And the word \"noob\" is\ncertainly not a compliment. And yet today I realized something\nencouraging about being a noob: the more of a noob you are locally,\nthe less of a noob you are globally.<br/><br/>For example, if you stay in your home country, you'll feel less\nof a noob than if you move to Farawavia, where everything works\ndifferently. And yet you'll know more if you move.\nSo the feeling of being a noob is inversely correlated with actual\nignorance.<br/><br/>But if the feeling of being a noob is good for us, why do we dislike\nit? What evolutionary purpose could such an aversion serve?<br/><br/>I think the answer is that there are two sources of feeling like a\nnoob: being stupid, and doing something novel. Our dislike of feeling\nlike a noob is our brain telling us \"Come on, come on, figure this\nout.\" Which was the right thing to be thinking for most of human\nhistory. The life of hunter-gatherers was complex, but it didn't\nchange as much as life does now. They didn't suddenly have to figure\nout what to do about cryptocurrency. So it made sense to be biased\ntoward competence at existing problems over the discovery of new\nones. It made sense for humans to dislike the feeling of being a\nnoob, just as, in a world where food was scarce, it made sense for\nthem to dislike the feeling of being hungry.<br/><br/>Now that too much food is more of a problem than too little, our\ndislike of feeling hungry leads us astray. And I think our dislike\nof feeling like a noob does too.<br/><br/>Though it feels unpleasant, and people will sometimes ridicule you\nfor it, the more you feel like a noob, the better.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></font>","date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
