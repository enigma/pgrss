{"href":"ace.html","title":"Billionaires Build","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">December 2020<br/><br/>As I was deciding what to write about next, I was surprised to find\nthat two separate essays I'd been planning to write were actually\nthe same.<br/><br/>The first is about how to ace your Y Combinator interview. There\nhas been so much nonsense written about this topic that I've been\nmeaning for years to write something telling founders the truth.<br/><br/>The second is about something politicians sometimes say  that the\nonly way to become a billionaire is by exploiting people  and why\nthis is mistaken.<br/><br/>Keep reading, and you'll learn both simultaneously.<br/><br/>I know the politicians are mistaken because it was my job to predict\nwhich people will become billionaires. I think I can truthfully say\nthat I know as much about how to do this as anyone. If the key to\nbecoming a billionaire  the defining feature of billionaires \nwas to exploit people, then I, as a professional billionaire scout,\nwould surely realize this and look for people who would be good at\nit, just as an NFL scout looks for speed in wide receivers.<br/><br/>But aptitude for exploiting people is not what Y Combinator looks\nfor at all. In fact, it's the opposite of what they look for. I'll\ntell you what they do look for, by explaining how to convince \nY Combinator to fund you, and you can see for yourself.<br/><br/>What YC looks for, above all, is founders who understand some group\nof users and can make what they want. This is so important that\nit's YC's motto: \"Make something people want.\"<br/><br/>A big company can to some extent force unsuitable products on\nunwilling customers, but a startup doesn't have the power to do\nthat. A startup must sing for its supper, by making things that\ngenuinely delight its customers. Otherwise it will never get off\nthe ground.<br/><br/>Here's where things get difficult, both for you as a founder and\nfor the YC partners trying to decide whether to fund you. In a\nmarket economy, it's hard to make something people want that they\ndon't already have. That's the great thing about market economies.\nIf other people both knew about this need and were able to satisfy\nit, they already would be, and there would be no room for your\nstartup.<br/><br/>Which means the conversation during your YC interview will have to\nbe about something new: either a new need, or a new way to satisfy\none. And not just new, but uncertain. If it were certain that the\nneed existed and that you could satisfy it, that certainty would\nbe reflected in large and rapidly growing revenues, and you wouldn't\nbe seeking seed funding.<br/><br/>So the YC partners have to guess both whether you've discovered a\nreal need, and whether you'll be able to satisfy it. That's what they\nare, at least in this part of their job: professional guessers.\nThey have 1001 heuristics for doing this, and I'm not going to tell\nyou all of them, but I'm happy to tell you the most important ones,\nbecause these can't be faked; the only way to \"hack\" them would be\nto do what you should be doing anyway as a founder.<br/><br/>The first thing the partners will try to figure out, usually, is\nwhether what you're making will ever be something a lot of people\nwant. It doesn't have to be something a lot of people want now.\nThe product and the market will both evolve, and will influence\neach other's evolution. But in the end there has to be something\nwith a huge market. That's what the partners will be trying to\nfigure out: is there a path to a huge market?\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"#f1n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Sometimes it's obvious there will be a huge market. If \n<a href=\"https://boomsupersonic.com/\"><u>Boom</u></a> manages\nto ship an airliner at all, international airlines will have to buy\nit. But usually it's not obvious. Usually the path to a huge market\nis by growing a small market. This idea is important enough that\nit's worth coining a phrase for, so let's call one of these small\nbut growable markets a \"larval market.\"<br/><br/>The perfect example of a larval market might be Apple's market when\nthey were founded in 1976. In 1976, not many people wanted their\nown computer. But more and more started to want one, till now every\n10 year old on the planet wants a computer (but calls it a \"phone\").<br/><br/>The ideal combination is the group of founders who are \n<a href=\"startupideas.html\"><u>\"living in\nthe future\"</u></a> in the sense of being at the leading edge of some kind\nof change, and who are building something they themselves want.\nMost super-successful startups are of this type. Steve Wozniak\nwanted a computer. Mark Zuckerberg wanted to engage online with his\ncollege friends. Larry and Sergey wanted to find things on the web.\nAll these founders were building things they and their peers wanted,\nand the fact that they were at the leading edge of change meant\nthat more people would want these things in the future.<br/><br/>But although the ideal larval market is oneself and one's peers,\nthat's not the only kind. A larval market might also be regional,\nfor example. You build something to serve one location, and then\nexpand to others.<br/><br/>The crucial feature of the initial market is that it exist. That\nmay seem like an obvious point, but the lack of it is the biggest\nflaw in most startup ideas. There have to be some people who want\nwhat you're building right now, and want it so urgently that they're\nwilling to use it, bugs and all, even though you're a small company\nthey've never heard of. There don't have to be many, but there have\nto be some. As long as you have some users, there are straightforward\nways to get more: build new features they want, seek out more people\nlike them, get them to refer you to their friends, and so on. But\nthese techniques all require some initial seed group of users.<br/><br/>So this is one thing the YC partners will almost certainly dig into\nduring your interview. Who are your first users going to be, and\nhow do you know they want this? If I had to decide whether to fund\nstartups based on a single question, it would be \"How do you know\npeople want this?\"<br/><br/>The most convincing answer is \"Because we and our friends want it.\"\nIt's even better when this is followed by the news that you've\nalready built a prototype, and even though it's very crude, your\nfriends are using it, and it's spreading by word of mouth. If you\ncan say that and you're not lying, the partners will switch from\ndefault no to default yes. Meaning you're in unless there's some\nother disqualifying flaw.<br/><br/>That is a hard standard to meet, though. Airbnb didn't meet it.\nThey had the first part. They had made something they themselves\nwanted. But it wasn't spreading. So don't feel bad if you don't hit\nthis gold standard of convincingness. If Airbnb didn't hit it, it\nmust be too high.<br/><br/>In practice, the YC partners will be satisfied if they feel that\nyou have a deep understanding of your users' needs. And the Airbnbs\ndid have that. They were able to tell us all about what motivated\nhosts and guests. They knew from first-hand experience, because\nthey'd been the first hosts. We couldn't ask them a question they\ndidn't know the answer to. We ourselves were not very excited about\nthe idea as users, but we knew this didn't prove anything, because\nthere were lots of successful startups we hadn't been excited about\nas users. We were able to say to ourselves \"They seem to know what\nthey're talking about. Maybe they're onto something. It's not growing\nyet, but maybe they can figure out how to make it grow during YC.\"\nWhich they did, about three weeks into the batch.<br/><br/>The best thing you can do in a YC interview is to teach the partners\nabout your users. So if you want to prepare for your interview, one of the best \nways to do it is to go talk to your users and find out exactly what\nthey're thinking. Which is what you should be doing anyway.<br/><br/>This may sound strangely credulous, but the YC partners want to\nrely on the founders to tell them about the market. Think about\nhow VCs typically judge the potential market for an idea. They're\nnot ordinarily domain experts themselves, so they forward the idea\nto someone who is, and ask for their opinion. YC doesn't have time\nto do this, but if the YC partners can convince themselves that the\nfounders both (a) know what they're talking about and (b) aren't\nlying, they don't need outside domain experts. They can use the\nfounders themselves as domain experts when evaluating their own\nidea.<br/><br/>This is why YC interviews aren't pitches. To give as many founders\nas possible a chance to get funded, we made interviews as short as\nwe could: 10 minutes. That is not enough time for the partners to\nfigure out, through the indirect evidence in a pitch, whether you\nknow what you're talking about and aren't lying. They need to dig\nin and ask you questions. There's not enough time for sequential\naccess. They need random access.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"#f2n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The worst advice I ever heard about how to succeed in a YC interview\nis that you should take control of the interview and make sure to\ndeliver the message you want to. In other words, turn the interview\ninto a pitch. ⟨elaborate expletive⟩. It is so annoying when people\ntry to do that. You ask them a question, and instead of answering\nit, they deliver some obviously prefabricated blob of pitch. It\neats up 10 minutes really fast.<br/><br/>There is no one who can give you accurate advice about what to do\nin a YC interview except a current or former YC partner. People\nwho've merely been interviewed, even successfully, have no idea of\nthis, but interviews take all sorts of different forms depending\non what the partners want to know about most. Sometimes they're all\nabout the founders, other times they're all about the idea. Sometimes\nsome very narrow aspect of the idea. Founders sometimes walk away\nfrom interviews complaining that they didn't get to explain their\nidea completely. True, but they explained enough.<br/><br/>Since a YC interview consists of questions, the way to do it well\nis to answer them well. Part of that is answering them candidly.\nThe partners don't expect you to know everything. But if you don't\nknow the answer to a question, don't try to bullshit your way out\nof it. The partners, like most experienced investors, are professional\nbullshit detectors, and you are (hopefully) an amateur bullshitter.\nAnd if you try to bullshit them and fail, they may not even tell\nyou that you failed. So it's better to be honest than to try to\nsell them. If you don't know the answer to a question, say you\ndon't, and tell them how you'd go about finding it, or tell them\nthe answer to some related question.<br/><br/>If you're asked, for example, what could go wrong, the worst possible\nanswer is \"nothing.\" Instead of convincing them that your idea is\nbullet-proof, this will convince them that you're a fool or a liar.\nFar better to go into gruesome detail. That's what experts do when\nyou ask what could go wrong.  The partners know that your idea is\nrisky. That's what a good bet looks like at this stage: a tiny\nprobability of a huge outcome.<br/><br/>Ditto if they ask about competitors. Competitors are rarely what\nkills startups. Poor execution does. But you should know who your\ncompetitors are, and tell the YC partners candidly what your relative\nstrengths and weaknesses are. Because the YC partners know that\ncompetitors don't kill startups, they won't hold competitors against\nyou too much. They will, however, hold it against you if you seem\neither to be unaware of competitors, or to be minimizing the threat\nthey pose. They may not be sure whether you're clueless or lying,\nbut they don't need to be.<br/><br/>The partners don't expect your idea to be perfect. This is seed\ninvesting. At this stage, all they can expect are promising hypotheses.\nBut they do expect you to be thoughtful and honest. So if trying\nto make your idea seem perfect causes you to come off as glib or\nclueless, you've sacrificed something you needed for something you\ndidn't.<br/><br/>If the partners are sufficiently convinced that there's a path to\na big market, the next question is whether you'll be able to find\nit. That in turn depends on three things: the general qualities of\nthe founders, their specific expertise in this domain, and the\nrelationship between them. How determined are the founders? Are\nthey good at building things? Are they resilient enough to keep\ngoing when things go wrong? How strong is their friendship?<br/><br/>Though the Airbnbs only did ok in the idea department, they did\nspectacularly well in this department. The story of how they'd\nfunded themselves by making Obama- and McCain-themed breakfast\ncereal was the single most important factor in our decision to fund\nthem. They didn't realize it at the time, but what seemed to them\nan irrelevant story was in fact fabulously good evidence of their\nqualities as founders. It showed they were resourceful and determined,\nand could work together.<br/><br/>It wasn't just the cereal story that showed that, though. The whole\ninterview showed that they cared. They weren't doing this just for\nthe money, or because startups were cool. The reason they were\nworking so hard on this company was because it was their project.\nThey had discovered an interesting new idea, and they just couldn't\nlet it go.<br/><br/>Mundane as it sounds, that's the most powerful motivator of all,\nnot just in startups, but in most ambitious undertakings: to be\n<a href=\"genius.html\"><u>genuinely interested</u></a> in what \nyou're building. This is what really\ndrives billionaires, or at least the ones who become billionaires\nfrom starting companies. The company is their project.<br/><br/>One thing few people realize about billionaires is that all of them\ncould have stopped sooner. They could have gotten acquired, or found\nsomeone else to run the company. Many founders do. The ones who\nbecome really rich are the ones who keep working. And what makes\nthem keep working is not just money. What keeps them working is the\nsame thing that keeps anyone else working when they could stop if\nthey wanted to: that there's nothing else they'd rather do.<br/><br/>That, not exploiting people, is the defining quality of people who\nbecome billionaires from starting companies. So that's what YC looks\nfor in founders: authenticity. People's motives for starting startups\nare usually mixed. They're usually doing it from some combination\nof the desire to make money, the desire to seem cool, genuine\ninterest in the problem, and unwillingness to work for someone else.\nThe last two are more powerful motivators than the first two. It's\nok for founders to want to make money or to seem cool. Most do.\nBut if the founders seem like they're doing it <i>just</i> to make money\nor <i>just</i> to seem cool, they're not likely to succeed on a big\nscale. The founders who are doing it for the money will take the\nfirst sufficiently large acquisition offer, and the ones who are\ndoing it to seem cool will rapidly discover that there are much\nless painful ways of seeming cool.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"#f3n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">3</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Y Combinator certainly sees founders whose m.o. is to exploit people.\nYC is a magnet for them, because they want the YC brand. But when\nthe YC partners detect someone like that, they reject them. If bad\npeople made good founders, the YC partners would face a moral\ndilemma. Fortunately they don't, because bad people make bad founders.\nThis exploitative type of founder is not going to succeed on a large\nscale, and in fact probably won't even succeed on a small one,\nbecause they're always going to be taking shortcuts. They see YC\nitself as a shortcut.<br/><br/>Their exploitation usually begins with their own cofounders, which\nis disastrous, since the cofounders' relationship is the foundation\nof the company. Then it moves on to the users, which is also\ndisastrous, because the sort of early adopters a successful startup\nwants as its initial users are the hardest to fool. The best this\nkind of founder can hope for is to keep the edifice of deception\ntottering along until some acquirer can be tricked into buying it.\nBut that kind of acquisition is never very big.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"#f4n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">4</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>If professional billionaire scouts know that exploiting people is\nnot the skill to look for, why do some politicians think this is\nthe defining quality of billionaires?<br/><br/>I think they start from the feeling that it's wrong that one person\ncould have so much more money than another. It's understandable\nwhere that feeling comes from. It's in our DNA, and even in the DNA\nof other species.<br/><br/>If they limited themselves to saying that it made them feel bad\nwhen one person had so much more money than other people, who would\ndisagree? It makes me feel bad too, and I think people who make a\nlot of money have a moral obligation to use it for the common good.\nThe mistake they make is to jump from feeling bad that some people\nare much richer than others to the conclusion that there's no\nlegitimate way to make a very large amount of money. Now we're\ngetting into statements that are not only falsifiable, but false.<br/><br/>There are certainly some people who become rich by doing bad things.\nBut there are also plenty of people who behave badly and don't make\nthat much from it. There is no correlation  in fact, probably an\ninverse correlation  between how badly you behave and how much\nmoney you make.<br/><br/>The greatest danger of this nonsense may not even be that it sends\npolicy astray, but that it misleads ambitious people. Can you imagine\na better way to destroy social mobility than by telling poor kids\nthat the way to get rich is by exploiting people, while the rich\nkids know, from having watched the preceding generation do it, how\nit's really done?<br/><br/>I'll tell you how it's really done, so you can at least tell your\nown kids the truth. It's all about users. The most reliable way to\nbecome a billionaire is to start a company that \n<a href=\"growth.html\"><u>grows fast</u></a>, and the\nway to grow fast is to make what users want. Newly started startups\nhave no choice but to delight users, or they'll never even get\nrolling. But this never stops being the lodestar, and bigger companies\ntake their eye off it at their peril. Stop delighting users, and\neventually someone else will.<br/><br/>Users are what the partners want to\nknow about in YC interviews, and what I want to know about when I\ntalk to founders that we funded ten years ago and who are billionaires\nnow. What do users want? What new things could you build for them?\nFounders who've become billionaires are always eager to talk about\nthat topic. That's how they became billionaires.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nThe YC partners have so much practice doing this that they\nsometimes see paths that the founders themselves haven't seen yet.\nThe partners don't try to seem skeptical, as buyers in transactions\noften do to increase their leverage. Although the founders feel\ntheir job is to convince the partners of the potential of their\nidea, these roles are not infrequently reversed, and the founders\nleave the interview feeling their idea has more potential than they\nrealized.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nIn practice, 7 minutes would be enough. You rarely change your\nmind at minute 8. But 10 minutes is socially convenient.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nI myself took the first sufficiently large acquisition offer\nin my first startup, so I don't blame founders for doing this.\nThere's nothing wrong with starting a startup to make money. You\nneed to make money somehow, and for some people startups are the\nmost efficient way to do it. I'm just saying that these are not the\nstartups that get really big.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f4n\"><font color=\"#000000\">4</font></a>]\nNot these days, anyway. There were some big ones during the\nInternet Bubble, and indeed some big IPOs.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, Geoff Ralston, and\nHarj Taggar for reading drafts of this.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2020-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
