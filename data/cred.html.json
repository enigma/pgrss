{"href":"cred.html","title":"Coronavirus and Credibility","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">April 2020<br/><br/>I recently saw a \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAh4uS4f78o\"><u>video</u></a> \nof TV journalists and politicians confidently\nsaying that the coronavirus would be no worse than the flu. What\nstruck me about it was not just how mistaken they seemed, but how\ndaring. How could they feel safe saying such things?<br/><br/>The answer, I realized, is that they didn't think they could get\ncaught. They didn't realize there was any danger in making false\npredictions. These people constantly make false predictions, and\nget away with it, because the things they make predictions about\neither have mushy enough outcomes that they can bluster their way\nout of trouble, or happen so far in the future that few remember\nwhat they said.<br/><br/>An epidemic is different. It falsifies your predictions rapidly and\nunequivocally.<br/><br/>But epidemics are rare enough that these people clearly\ndidn't realize this was even a possibility. Instead they just\ncontinued to use their ordinary m.o., which, as the epidemic has\nmade clear, is to talk confidently about things they don't\nunderstand.<br/><br/>An event like this is thus a uniquely powerful way of taking people's\nmeasure. As Warren Buffett said, \"It's only when the tide goes out\nthat you learn who's been swimming naked.\" And the tide has just\ngone out like never before.<br/><br/>Now that we've seen the results, let's remember what we saw, because\nthis is the most accurate test of credibility we're ever likely to have. I hope.<br/><br/><br/><br/></font>","date":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z"}
