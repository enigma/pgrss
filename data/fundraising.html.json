But the second biggest\ncause of death is probably the difficulty of raising money.\nFundraising is brutal.<br/><br/>One reason it's so brutal is simply the brutality of markets.  People\nwho've spent most of their lives in schools or big companies may\nnot have been exposed to that.  Professors and bosses usually feel\nsome sense of responsibility toward you; if you make a valiant\neffort and fail, they'll cut you a break.  Markets are less forgiving.\nCustomers don't care how hard you worked, only whether you solved\ntheir problems.<br/><br/>Investors evaluate startups the way customers evaluate products,\nnot the way bosses evaluate employees.  If you're making a valiant\neffort and failing, maybe they'll invest in your next startup, but\nnot this one.<br/><br/>But raising money from investors is harder than selling to\ncustomers, because there are so few of them.  There's\nnothing like an efficient market.  You're unlikely to have more\nthan 10 who are interested; it's difficult to talk to more.  So the\nrandomness of any one investor's behavior can really affect you.<br/><br/>Problem number 3: investors are very random.  All investors, including\nus, are by ordinary standards incompetent.  We constantly have to\nmake decisions about things we don't understand, and more often\nthan not we're wrong.<br/><br/>And yet a lot is at stake.  The amounts invested by different types\nof investors vary from five thousand dollars to fifty million, but\nthe amount usually seems large for whatever type of investor it is.\nInvestment decisions are big decisions.<br/><br/>That combination—making big decisions about things they don't\nunderstand—tends to make investors very skittish.  VCs are notorious\nfor leading founders on.  Some of the more unscrupulous do it\ndeliberately.  But even the most well-intentioned investors can\nbehave in a way that would seem crazy in everyday life.  One day\nthey're full of enthusiasm and seem ready to write you a check on\nthe spot; the next they won't return your phone calls.  They're not\nplaying games with you.  They just can't make up their minds.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f1n\"><font color=\"#999999\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>If that weren't bad enough, these wildly fluctuating nodes are all\nlinked together.  Startup investors all know one another, and (though\nthey hate to admit it) the biggest factor in their opinion of you\nis the opinion of other investors.  \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f2n\"><font color=\"#999999\">2</font></a>]</font>\nTalk about a recipe for\nan unstable system.  You get the opposite of the damping that the\nfear/greed balance usually produces in markets.  No one is interested\nin a startup that's a \"bargain\" because everyone else hates it.<br/><br/>So the inefficient market you get because there are so few players\nis exacerbated by the fact that they act less than independently.\nThe result is a system like some kind of primitive, multi-celled\nsea creature, where you irritate one extremity and the whole thing\ncontracts violently.<br/><br/>Y Combinator is working to fix this.  We're trying to increase the\nnumber of investors just as we're increasing the number of startups.\nWe hope that as the number of both increases we'll get something\nmore like an efficient market.  As t approaches infinity, Demo Day\napproaches an auction.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, t is still very far from infinity.  What does a\nstartup do now, in the imperfect world we currently inhabit? The\nmost important thing is not to let fundraising get you down.  Startups\nlive or die on morale.  If you let the difficulty of raising money\ndestroy your morale, it will become a self-fulfilling prophecy.<br/><br/>\n<b>Bootstrapping (= Consulting)</b><br/><br/>Some would-be founders may by now be thinking, why deal with investors\nat all?  If raising money is so painful, why do it?<br/><br/>One answer to that is obvious: because you need money to live on.\nIt's a fine idea in principle to finance your startup with its own\nrevenues, but you can't create instant customers.  Whatever you\nmake, you have to sell a certain amount to break even.  It will\ntake time to grow your sales to that point, and it's hard to predict,\ntill you try, how long it will take.<br/><br/>We could not have bootstrapped Viaweb, for example.  We charged\nquite a lot for our software—about $140 per user per month—but\nit was at least a year before our revenues would have covered even\nour paltry costs.  We didn't have enough saved to live on for a\nyear.<br/><br/>If you factor out the \"bootstrapped\" companies that were actually\nfunded by their founders through savings or a day job, the remainder\neither (a) got really lucky, which is hard to do on demand, or (b)\nbegan life as consulting companies and gradually transformed\nthemselves into product companies.<br/><br/>Consulting is the only option you can count on.  But consulting is\nfar from free money.  It's not as painful as raising money from\ninvestors, perhaps, but the pain is spread over a longer period.\nYears, probably.  And for many types of startup, that delay could\nbe fatal.  If you're working on something so unusual that no one\nelse is likely to think of it, you can take your time.  Joshua\nSchachter gradually built Delicious on the side while working on\nWall Street.  He got away with it because no one else realized it\nwas a good idea.  But if you were building something as obviously\nnecessary as online store software at about the same time as Viaweb,\nand you were working on it on the side while spending most of your\ntime on client work, you were not in a good position.<br/><br/>Bootstrapping sounds great in principle, but this apparently verdant\nterritory is one from which few startups emerge alive.  The mere\nfact that bootstrapped startups tend to be famous on that account\nshould set off alarm bells.  If it worked so well, it would be the\nnorm.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f3n\"><font color=\"#999999\">3</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>\nBootstrapping may get easier, because starting a company is getting\ncheaper.  But I don't think we'll ever reach the point where most\nstartups can do without outside funding.  Technology tends to\nget dramatically cheaper, but living expenses don't.<br/><br/>The upshot is, you can choose your pain: either the short, sharp\npain of raising money, or the chronic ache of consulting.  For a\ngiven total amount of pain, raising money is the better choice,\nbecause new technology is usually more valuable now than later.<br/><br/>But although for most startups raising money will be the lesser\nevil, it's still a pretty big evil—so big that it can easily kill\nyou.  Not merely in the obvious sense that if you fail to raise\nmoney you might have to shut the company down, but because the\n<i>process</i> of raising money itself can kill you.<br/><br/>To survive it you need a set of techniques mostly\northogonal to the ones used in convincing investors, just as mountain\nclimbers need to know survival techniques that are mostly orthogonal\nto those used in physically getting up and down mountains.<br/><br/>\n<b>1. Have low expectations.</b><br/><br/>The reason raising money destroys so many startups' morale is not\nsimply that it's hard, but that it's so much harder than they\nexpected.  What kills you is the disappointment.  And the lower\nyour expectations, the harder it is to be disappointed.<br/><br/>Startup founders tend to be optimistic.  This can work well in\ntechnology, at least some of the time, but it's the wrong way to\napproach raising money.  Better to assume investors will always let\nyou down.  Acquirers too, while we're at it.  At YC one of our\nsecondary mantras is \"Deals fall through.\"  No matter what deal\nyou have going on, assume it will fall through.  The predictive\npower of this simple rule is amazing.<br/><br/>There will be a tendency, as a deal progresses, to start to believe\nit will happen, and then to depend on it happening.  You must resist\nthis.  Tie yourself to the mast.  This is what kills you.  Deals\ndo not have a trajectory like most other human interactions, where\nshared plans solidify linearly over time.  Deals often fall through\nat the last moment.  Often the other party doesn't really think\nabout what they want till the last moment.  So you can't use your\neveryday intuitions about shared plans as a guide.  When it comes\nto deals, you have to consciously turn them off and become\npathologically cynical.<br/><br/>This is harder to do than it sounds.  It's very flattering when\neminent investors seem interested in funding you.  It's easy to\nstart to believe that raising money will be quick and straightforward.\nBut it hardly ever is.<br/><br/>\n<b>2. Keep working on your startup.</b><br/><br/>It sounds obvious to say that you should keep working on your startup\nwhile raising money.  Actually this is hard to do.  Most startups\ndon't manage to.<br/><br/>Raising money has a mysterious capacity to suck up all your attention.\nEven if you only have one meeting a day with investors, somehow\nthat one meeting will burn up your whole day.  It costs not just\nthe time of the actual meeting, but the time getting there and back,\nand the time preparing for it beforehand and thinking about it\nafterward.<br/><br/>The best way to survive the distraction of meeting with investors\nis probably to partition the company: to pick one founder to deal\nwith investors while the others keep the company going.  This works\nbetter when a startup has 3 founders than 2, and better when the\nleader of the company is not also the lead developer.  In the best\ncase, the company keeps moving forward at about half speed.<br/><br/>That's the best case, though.  More often than not the company comes\nto a standstill while raising money.  And that is dangerous for so\nmany reasons.  Raising money always takes longer than you expect.\nWhat seems like it's going to be a 2 week interruption turns into\na 4 month interruption.  That can be very demoralizing.  And worse\nstill, it can make you less attractive to investors.  They want to\ninvest in companies that are dynamic.  A company that hasn't done\nanything new in 4 months doesn't seem dynamic, so they start to\nlose interest.  Investors rarely grasp this, but much of what\nthey're responding to when they lose interest in a startup is the\ndamage done by their own indecision.<br/><br/>The solution: put the startup first.  Fit meetings with investors\ninto the spare moments in your development schedule, rather than\ndoing development in the spare moments between meetings with\ninvestors.  If you keep the company moving forward—releasing new\nfeatures, increasing traffic, doing deals, getting written \nabout—those investor meetings are more likely to be productive.  Not just\nbecause your startup will seem more alive, but also because it will\nbe better for your own morale, which is one of the main ways investors\njudge you.<br/><br/>\n<b>3. Be conservative.</b><br/><br/>As conditions get worse, the optimal strategy becomes more conservative.\nWhen things go well you can take risks; when things are bad you\nwant to play it safe.<br/><br/>I advise approaching fundraising as if it were always going badly.\nThe reason is that between your ability to delude yourself and the\nwildly unstable nature of the system you're dealing with, things\nprobably either already are or could easily become much worse than\nthey seem.<br/><br/>What I tell most startups we fund is that if someone reputable\noffers you funding on reasonable terms, take it.  There have been\nstartups that ignored this advice and got away with it—startups\nthat ignored a good offer in the hope of getting a better one, and\nactually did.  But in the same position I'd give the same advice\nagain.  Who knows how many bullets were in the gun they were playing\nRussian roulette with?<br/><br/>Corollary: if an investor seems interested, don't just let them\nsit. You can't assume someone interested in investing will stay\ninterested.  In fact, you can't even tell (<i>they</i> can't even tell)\nif they're really interested till you try to convert that interest\ninto money.  So if you have hot prospect, either close them now or\nwrite them off.  And unless you already have enough funding, that\nreduces to: close them now.<br/><br/>Startups don't win by getting great funding rounds, but by making\ngreat products.  So finish raising money and get\nback to work.<br/><br/>\n<b>4. Be flexible.</b><br/><br/>There are two questions VCs ask that you shouldn't answer: \"Who\nelse are you talking to?\" and \"How much are you trying to raise?\"<br/><br/>VCs don't expect you to answer the first question. They ask it just\nin case. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f4n\"><font color=\"#999999\">4</font></a>]</font>\nThey do seem to expect an answer to the second.  But\nI don't think you should just tell them a number.  Not as a way to\nplay games with them, but because you shouldn't <i>have</i> a fixed\namount you need to raise.<br/><br/>The custom of a startup needing a fixed amount of funding is an\nobsolete one left over from the days when startups were more\nexpensive.  A company that needed to build a factory or hire 50\npeople obviously needed to raise a certain minimum amount.  But few\ntechnology startups are in that position today.<br/><br/>We advise startups to tell investors there are several different\nroutes they could take depending on how much they raised.  As little\nas $50k could pay for food and rent for the founders for a year.\nA couple hundred thousand would let them get office space and hire\nsome smart people they know from school.  A couple million would\nlet them really blow this thing out.  The message (and not just the\nmessage, but the fact) should be: we're going to succeed no matter\nwhat.  Raising more money just lets us do it faster.<br/><br/>If you're raising an angel round, the size of the round can even\nchange on the fly.  In fact, it's just as well to make the round\nsmall initially, then expand as needed, rather than trying to raise\na large round and risk losing the investors you already have if you\ncan't raise the full amount.  You may even want to do a \"rolling\nclose,\" where the round has no predetermined size, but instead you\nsell stock to investors one at a time as they say yes.  That helps\nbreak deadlocks, because you can start as soon as the first one\nis ready to buy. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f5n\"><font color=\"#999999\">5</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>\n<b>5. Be independent.</b><br/><br/>A startup with a couple founders in their early twenties can have\nexpenses so low that they could be profitable on\nas little as $2000 per month.  That's negligible as corporate\nrevenues go, but the effect on your morale and your bargaining\nposition is anything but.  At YC we use the phrase \"ramen profitable\"\nto describe the situation where you're making just enough to pay\nyour living expenses.  Once you cross into ramen profitable,\neverything changes.  You may still need investment to make it big,\nbut you don't need it this month.<br/><br/>You can't plan when you start a startup how long\nit will take to become profitable.  But if you find yourself in a\nposition where a little more effort expended on sales would carry\nyou over the threshold of ramen profitable, do it.<br/><br/>Investors like it when you're ramen profitable.  It shows you've\nthought about making money, instead of just working on amusing\ntechnical problems; it shows you have the discipline to keep your\nexpenses low; but above all, it means you don't need them.<br/><br/>There is nothing investors like more than a startup that seems like\nit's going to succeed even without them.  Investors like it when\nthey can help a startup, but they don't like startups that would\ndie without that help.<br/><br/>At YC we spend a lot of time trying to predict how the startups we've\nfunded will do, because we're trying to learn how to pick winners.\nWe've now watched the trajectories of so many startups that we're\ngetting better at predicting them.  And when we're talking\nabout startups we think are likely to succeed, what we find ourselves\nsaying is things like \"Oh, those guys can take care of themselves.\nThey'll be fine.\" Not \"those guys are really smart\" or\n\"those guys are working on a great idea.\"\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f6n\"><font color=\"#999999\">6</font></a>]</font>\nWhen we predict good outcomes for startups, the qualities\nthat come up in the supporting arguments are toughness, adaptability,\ndetermination.  Which means to the extent we're correct, those are\nthe qualities you need to win.<br/><br/>Investors know this, at least unconsciously.   The reason they like\nit when you don't need them is not simply that they like what they\ncan't have, but because that quality is what makes founders succeed.<br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhId_WG7RA\">Sam Altman</a> \nhas it.  You could parachute him into an island full of\ncannibals and come back in 5 years and he'd be the king.  If you're\nSam Altman, you don't have to be profitable to convey to investors\nthat you'll succeed with or without them.  (He wasn't, and he did.)\nNot everyone has Sam's deal-making ability.  I myself don't.  But\nif you don't, you can let the numbers speak for you.<br/><br/>\n<b>6. Don't take rejection personally.</b><br/><br/>Getting rejected by investors can make you start to doubt yourself.\nAfter all, they're more experienced than you.  If they think your\nstartup is lame, aren't they probably right?<br/><br/>Maybe, maybe not.  The way to handle rejection is with precision.\nYou shouldn't simply ignore rejection.  It might mean something.\nBut you shouldn't automatically get demoralized either.<br/><br/>To understand what rejection means, you have to understand first\nof all how common it is.  Statistically, the average VC is a rejection\nmachine.  David Hornik, a partner at August, told me:\n<blockquote>\n  The numbers for me ended up being something like 500 to 800 plans\n  received and read, somewhere between 50 and 100 initial 1 hour\n  meetings held, about 20 companies that I got interested in, about\n  5 that I got serious about and did a bunch of work, 1 to 2 deals\n  done in a year.  So the odds are against you.  You\n  may be a great entrepreneur, working on interesting stuff, etc.\n  but it is still incredibly unlikely that you get funded.\n</blockquote>\nThis is less true with angels, but VCs reject practically everyone.\nThe structure of their business means a partner does at most 2 new\ninvestments a year, no matter how many good startups approach him.<br/><br/>In addition to the odds being terrible, the average investor is,\nas I mentioned, a pretty bad judge of startups.  It's harder to\njudge startups than most other things, because great startup ideas\ntend to seem wrong. A good startup idea has to be not just good but\nnovel.  And to be both good and novel, an idea probably has to seem\nbad to most people, or someone would already be doing it and it\nwouldn't be novel.<br/><br/>That makes judging startups harder than most other things one judges.\nYou have to be an intellectual contrarian to be a good startup\ninvestor.  That's a problem for VCs, most of whom are not particularly\nimaginative.  VCs are mostly money guys, not people who make things.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f7n\"><font color=\"#999999\">7</font></a>]</font>\nAngels are better at appreciating novel ideas, because most\nwere founders themselves.<br/><br/>So when you get a rejection, use the data that's in it, and not what's\nnot.  If an investor gives you specific reasons for not investing,\nlook at your startup and ask if they're right.  If they're real\nproblems, fix them.  But don't just take their word for it.  You're\nsupposed to be the domain expert; you have to decide.<br/><br/>Though a rejection doesn't necessarily tell you anything about your\nstartup, it does suggest your pitch could be improved.  Figure out\nwhat's not working and change it.  Don't just think \"investors are\nstupid.\"  Often they are, but figure out precisely where you lose\nthem.<br/><br/>Don't let rejections pile up as a depressing, undifferentiated heap.\nSort them and analyze them, and then instead of thinking \"no one\nlikes us,\" you'll know precisely how big a problem you have, and\nwhat to do about it.<br/><br/>\n<b>7. Be able to downshift into consulting (if appropriate).</b><br/><br/>Consulting, as I mentioned, is a dangerous way to finance a startup.\nBut it's better than dying.  It's a bit like anaerobic respiration:\nnot the optimum solution for the long term, but it can save you\nfrom an immediate threat.  If you're having trouble raising money\nfrom investors at all, it could save you to be able to shift\ntoward consulting.<br/><br/>This works better for some startups than others.  It wouldn't have\nbeen a natural fit for, say, Google, but if your company was making\nsoftware for building web sites, you could degrade fairly gracefully\ninto consulting by building sites for clients with it.<br/><br/>So long as you were careful not to get sucked permanently into\nconsulting, this could even have advantages.  You'd understand your\nusers well if you were using the software for them.  Plus as a\nconsulting company you might be able to get big-name users using\nyour software that you wouldn't have gotten as a product company.<br/><br/>At Viaweb we were forced to operate like a consulting company\ninitially, because we were so desperate for users that we'd offer\nto build merchants' sites for them if they'd sign up. \nBut we never charged for such work, because we didn't want them to\nstart treating us like actual consultants, and calling us every\ntime they wanted something changed on their site.  We knew we had\nto stay a product company, because only\nthat scales.<br/><br/>\n<b>8. Avoid inexperienced investors.</b><br/><br/>Though novice investors seem unthreatening they can be the most\ndangerous sort, because they're so nervous.  Especially in\nproportion to the amount they invest.  Raising $20,000 from a first-time\nangel investor can be as much work as raising $2 million from\na VC fund.<br/><br/>Their lawyers are generally inexperienced too.  But while the\ninvestors can admit they don't know what they're doing, their lawyers\ncan't.  One YC startup negotiated terms for a tiny round with\nan angel, only to receive a 70-page agreement from his lawyer.  And\nsince the lawyer could never admit, in front of his client, that\nhe'd screwed up, he instead had to insist on retaining all the\ndraconian terms in it, so the deal fell through.<br/><br/>Of course, someone has to take money from novice investors, or there\nwould never be any experienced ones.  But if you do, either (a)\ndrive the process yourself, including supplying the \n<a href=\"http://ycombinator.com/seriesaa.html\">paperwork</a>, or\n(b) use them only to fill up a larger round led by someone else.<br/><br/>\n<b>9. Know where you stand.</b><br/><br/>The most dangerous thing about investors is their indecisiveness.\nThe worst case scenario is the long no, the no that comes after\nmonths of meetings.  Rejections from investors are like design\nflaws: inevitable, but much less costly if you discover them early.<br/><br/>So while you're talking to investors, constantly look for signs of\nwhere you stand.  How likely are they to offer you a term sheet?\nWhat do they have to be convinced of first?  You shouldn't necessarily\nalways be asking these questions outright—that could get \nannoying—but you should always be collecting data about them.<br/><br/>Investors tend to resist committing except to the extent you push\nthem to.  It's in their interest to collect the maximum amount of\ninformation while making the minimum number of decisions.  The best\nway to force them to act is, of course, competing investors.  But\nyou can also apply some force by focusing the discussion:\nby asking what specific questions they need answered to make\nup their minds, and then answering them.  If you get through several\nobstacles and they keep raising new ones, assume that ultimately\nthey're going to flake.<br/><br/>You have to be disciplined when collecting data about investors'\nintentions.  Otherwise their desire to lead you on will combine\nwith your own desire to be led on to produce completely inaccurate\nimpressions.<br/><br/>Use the data to weight your strategy.\nYou'll probably be talking to several investors.  Focus on the ones\nthat are most likely to say yes.  The value of a potential investor\nis a combination of how good it would be if they said yes, and how\nlikely they are to say it.  Put the most weight on the second factor.\nPartly because the most important quality in an investor is simply\ninvesting.  But also because, as I mentioned, the biggest factor\nin investors' opinion of you is other investors' opinion of you.\nIf you're talking to several investors and you manage to get one\nover the threshold of saying yes, it will make the others much more\ninterested.  So you're not sacrificing the lukewarm investors if\nyou focus on the hot ones; convincing the hot investors is the best\nway to convince the lukewarm ones.<br/><br/>\n<b>Future</b><br/><br/>I'm hopeful things won't always be so awkward. I hope that as startups\nget cheaper and the number of investors increases, raising money\nwill become, if not easy, at least straightforward.<br/><br/>In the meantime, the brokenness of the funding process offers a big\nopportunity.  Most investors have no idea how dangerous they are.\nThey'd be surprised to hear that raising money from them is something\nthat has to be treated as a threat to a company's survival.  They\njust think they need a little more information to make up their\nminds.  They don't get that there are 10 other investors who also\nwant a little more information, and that the process of talking to\nthem all can bring a startup to a standstill for months.<br/><br/>Because investors don't understand the cost of dealing with them,\nthey don't realize how much room there is for a potential competitor\nto undercut them.  I know from my own experience how much faster\ninvestors could decide, because we've brought our own time down to\n20 minutes (5 minutes of reading an application plus a 10 minute\ninterview plus 5 minutes of discussion).  If you were investing\nmore money you'd want to take longer, of course.  But if we can\ndecide in 20 minutes, should it take anyone longer than a couple\ndays?<br/><br/>Opportunities like this don't sit unexploited forever, even in an\nindustry as conservative as venture capital.  So\neither existing investors will start to make up their minds faster,\nor new investors will emerge who do.<br/><br/>In the meantime founders have to treat raising money as a dangerous\nprocess.  Fortunately, I can fix the biggest danger right here.\nThe biggest danger is surprise.  It's that startups will underestimate\nthe difficulty of raising money—that they'll cruise through all\nthe initial steps, but when they turn to raising money they'll find\nit surprisingly hard, get demoralized, and give up. So I'm telling\nyou in advance: raising money is hard.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nWhen investors can't make up their minds, they sometimes\ndescribe it as if it were a property of the startup.  \"You're too\nearly for us,\" they sometimes say.  But which of them, if they were\ntaken back in a time machine to the hour Google was founded, wouldn't\noffer to invest at any valuation the founders chose?  An hour old\nis not too early if it's the right startup.  What \"you're too early\"\nreally means is \"we can't figure out yet whether you'll succeed.\"<br/><br/>\n[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nInvestors influence one another both directly and indirectly.\nThey influence one another directly through the \"buzz\" that surrounds\na hot startup.  But they also influence one another indirectly\n<i>through the founders.</i>  When a lot of investors are interested in\nyou, it increases your confidence in a way that makes you much more\nattractive to investors.<br/><br/>No VC will admit they're influenced by buzz.  Some genuinely aren't.\nBut there are few who can say they're not influenced by confidence.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nOne VC who read this essay wrote:<br/><br/>\"We try to avoid companies that got bootstrapped with consulting. \nIt creates very bad behaviors/instincts that are hard to erase \nfrom a company's culture.\"<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f4n\"><font color=\"#000000\">4</font></a>]\nThe optimal way to answer the first question is to say that\nit would be improper to name names, while simultaneously implying\nthat you're talking to a bunch of other VCs who are all about to\ngive you term sheets.  If you're the sort of person who understands\nhow to do that, go ahead.  If not, don't even try.  Nothing annoys\nVCs more than clumsy efforts to manipulate them.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f5n\"><font color=\"#000000\">5</font></a>]\nThe disadvantage of expanding a round on the fly is that the\nvaluation is fixed at the start, so if you get a sudden rush of\ninterest, you may have to decide between turning some investors\naway and selling more of the company than you meant to.
