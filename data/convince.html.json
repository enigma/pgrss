The right way to lift\nheavy things is to let your legs do the work.  Inexperienced founders\nmake the same mistake when trying to convince investors.  They try\nto convince with their pitch.  Most would be better off if they let\ntheir startup do the work — if they started by understanding why\ntheir startup is worth investing in, then simply explained this\nwell to investors.<br/><br/>Investors are looking for startups that will be very successful.\nBut that test is not as simple as it sounds.  In startups, as in a\nlot of other domains, the distribution of outcomes follows a power\nlaw, but in startups the curve is startlingly steep.  The big\nsuccesses are so big they \n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/swan.html\">dwarf</a> the rest.  And since there are only\na handful each year (the conventional wisdom is 15), investors treat\n\"big success\" as if it were binary.  Most are interested in you if\nyou seem like you have a chance, however small, of being one of the\n15 big successes, and otherwise not.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/convince.html#f1n\"><font color=\"#999999\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>(There are a handful of angels who'd be interested in a company\nwith a high probability of being moderately successful.  But angel\ninvestors like big successes too.)<br/><br/>How do you seem like you'll be one of the big successes?  You need\nthree things: formidable founders, a promising market, and (usually)\nsome evidence of success so far.<br/><br/><b>Formidable</b><br/><br/>The most important ingredient is formidable founders.  Most investors\ndecide in the first few minutes whether you seem like a winner or\na loser, and once their opinion is set it's hard to change. <font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/convince.html#f2n\"><font color=\"#999999\">2</font></a>]</font>\nEvery startup has reasons both to invest and not to invest.  If\ninvestors think you're a winner they focus on the former, and if\nnot they focus on the latter.  For example, it might be a rich\nmarket, but with a slow sales cycle.  If investors are impressed\nwith you as founders, they say they want to invest because it's a\nrich market, and if not, they say they can't invest because of the\nslow sales cycle.<br/><br/>They're not necessarily trying to mislead you.  Most investors are\ngenuinely unclear in their own minds why they like or dislike\nstartups.  If you seem like a winner, they'll like your idea more.\nBut don't be too smug about this weakness of theirs, because you\nhave it too; almost everyone does.<br/><br/>There is a role for ideas of course.  They're fuel for the fire\nthat starts with liking the founders.  Once investors like you,\nyou'll see them reaching for ideas: they'll be saying \"yes, and you\ncould also do x.\"  (Whereas when they don't like you, they'll be\nsaying \"but what about y?\")<br/><br/>But the foundation of convincing investors is to seem formidable,\nand since this isn't a word most people use in conversation much,\nI should explain what it means.  A formidable person is one who\nseems like they'll get what they want, regardless of whatever\nobstacles are in the way.  Formidable is close to confident, except\nthat someone could be confident and mistaken.  Formidable is roughly\njustifiably confident.<br/><br/>There are a handful of people who are really good at seeming\nformidable — some because they actually are very formidable and\njust let it show, and others because they are more or less con\nartists.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/convince.html#f3n\"><font color=\"#999999\">3</font></a>]</font>\nBut most founders, including many who will go on\nto start very successful companies, are not that good at seeming\nformidable the first time they try fundraising.  What should they\ndo?\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/convince.html#f4n\"><font color=\"#999999\">4</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>What they should not do is try to imitate the swagger of more\nexperienced founders.  Investors are not always that good at judging\ntechnology, but they're good at judging confidence.  If you try to\nact like something you're not, you'll just end up in an uncanny\nvalley.  You'll depart from sincere, but never arrive at convincing.<br/><br/><b>Truth</b><br/><br/>The way to seem most formidable as an inexperienced founder is to\nstick to the truth.   How formidable you seem isn't a constant.  It\nvaries depending on what you're saying.  Most people can seem\nconfident when they're saying \"one plus one is two,\" because they\nknow it's true.  The most diffident person would be puzzled and\neven slightly contemptuous if they told a VC \"one plus one is two\"\nand the VC reacted with skepticism.  The magic ability of people\nwho are good at seeming formidable is that they can do this with\nthe sentence \"we're going to make a billion dollars a year.\"  But\nyou can do the same, if not with that sentence with some fairly\nimpressive ones, so long as you convince yourself first.<br/><br/>That's the secret.  Convince yourself that your startup is worth\ninvesting in, and then when you explain this to investors they'll\nbelieve you.  And by convince yourself, I don't mean play mind games\nwith yourself to boost your confidence.  I mean truly evaluate\nwhether your startup is worth investing in.  If it isn't, don't try\nto raise money.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/convince.html#f5n\"><font color=\"#999999\">5</font></a>]</font>\nBut if it is, you'll be telling the truth\nwhen you tell investors it's worth investing in, and they'll sense\nthat.  You don't have to be a smooth presenter if you understand\nsomething well and tell the truth about it.<br/><br/>To evaluate whether your startup is worth investing in, you have\nto be a domain expert.  If you're not a domain expert, you can be\nas convinced as you like about your idea, and it will seem to\ninvestors no more than an instance of the Dunning-Kruger effect.\nWhich in fact it will usually be.  And investors can tell fairly\nquickly whether you're a domain expert by how well you answer their\nquestions.  Know everything about your market.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/convince.html#f6n\"><font color=\"#999999\">6</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Why do founders persist in trying to convince investors of things\nthey're not convinced of themselves?  Partly because we've all been\ntrained to.<br/><br/>When my friends Robert Morris and Trevor Blackwell were in grad\nschool, one of their fellow students was on the receiving end of a\nquestion from their faculty advisor that we still quote today.  When\nthe unfortunate fellow got to his last slide, the professor burst\nout:\n<blockquote>\n  Which one of these conclusions do you actually believe?\n</blockquote>\nOne of the artifacts of the way schools are organized is that we\nall get trained to talk even when we have nothing to say.  If you\nhave a ten page paper due, then ten pages you must write, even if\nyou only have one page of ideas.  Even if you have no ideas.  You\nhave to produce something.  And all too many startups go into\nfundraising in the same spirit.  When they think it's time to raise\nmoney, they try gamely to make the best case they can for their\nstartup.  Most never think of pausing beforehand to ask whether\nwhat they're saying is actually convincing, because they've all\nbeen trained to treat the need to present as a given — as an area\nof fixed size, over which however much truth they have must needs\nbe spread, however thinly.<br/><br/>The time to raise money is not when you need it, or when you reach\nsome artificial deadline like a Demo Day.  It's when you can convince\ninvestors, and not before. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/convince.html#f7n\"><font color=\"#999999\">7</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>And unless you're a good con artist, you'll never convince investors\nif you're not convinced yourself.  They're far better at detecting\nbullshit than you are at producing it, even if you're producing it\nunknowingly.  If you try to convince investors before you've convinced\nyourself, you'll be wasting both your time.<br/><br/>But pausing first to convince yourself will do more than save you\nfrom wasting your time.  It will force you to organize your thoughts.\nTo convince yourself that your startup is worth investing in, you'll\nhave to figure out why it's worth investing in.   And if you can\ndo that you'll end up with more than added confidence.  You'll also\nhave a provisional roadmap of how to succeed.<br/><br/><b>Market</b><br/><br/>Notice I've been careful to talk about whether a startup is worth\ninvesting in, rather than whether it's going to succeed.  No one\nknows whether a startup is going to succeed.  And it's a good thing\nfor investors that this is so, because if you could know in advance\nwhether a startup would succeed, the stock price would already be\nthe future price, and there would be no room for investors to make\nmoney.  Startup investors know that every investment is a bet, and\nagainst pretty long odds.<br/><br/>So to prove you're worth investing in, you don't have to prove\nyou're going to succeed, just that you're a sufficiently good bet.\nWhat makes a startup a sufficiently good bet?  In addition to\nformidable founders, you need a plausible path to owning a big piece\nof a big market.  Founders think of startups as ideas, but investors\nthink of them as markets.  If there are x number of customers who'd\npay an average of $y per year for what you're making, then the total\naddressable market, or TAM, of your company is $xy.  Investors don't\nexpect you to collect all that money, but it's an upper bound on\nhow big you can get.<br/><br/>Your target market has to be big, and it also has to be capturable\nby you.  But the market doesn't have to be big yet, nor do you\nnecessarily have to be in it yet.  Indeed, it's often better to\nstart in a <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/ds.html\">small</a> market that will either turn into a big one or\nfrom which you can move into a big one.  There just has to be some\nplausible sequence of hops that leads to dominating a big market a\nfew years down the line.<br/><br/>The standard of plausibility varies dramatically depending on the\nage of the startup.  A three month old company at Demo Day only\nneeds to be a promising experiment that's worth funding to see how\nit turns out.  Whereas a two year old company raising a series A\nround needs to be able to show the experiment worked. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/convince.html#f8n\"><font color=\"#999999\">8</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>But every company that gets really big is \"lucky\" in the sense that\ntheir growth is due mostly to some external wave they're riding,\nso to make a convincing case for becoming huge, you have to identify\nsome specific trend you'll benefit from.  Usually you can find this\nby asking \"why now?\"  If this is such a great idea, why hasn't\nsomeone else already done it?  Ideally the answer is that it only\nrecently became a good idea, because something changed, and no one\nelse has noticed yet.<br/><br/>Microsoft for example was not going to grow huge selling Basic\ninterpreters.  But by starting there they were perfectly poised to\nexpand up the stack of microcomputer software as microcomputers\ngrew powerful enough to support one. And microcomputers turned out\nto be a really huge wave, bigger than even the most optimistic\nobservers would have predicted in 1975.<br/><br/>But while Microsoft did really well and there is thus a temptation\nto think they would have seemed a great bet a few months in, they\nprobably didn't.  Good, but not great.  No company, however successful,\never looks more than a pretty good bet a few months in. Microcomputers\nturned out to be a big deal, and Microsoft both executed well and\ngot lucky.  But it was by no means obvious that this was how things\nwould play out.  Plenty of companies seem as good a bet a few months\nin.  I don't know about startups in general, but at least half the\nstartups we fund could make as good a case as Microsoft could have\nfor being on a path to dominating a large market.  And who can\nreasonably expect more of a startup than that?<br/><br/><b>Rejection</b><br/><br/>If you can make as good a case as Microsoft could have, will you\nconvince investors?  Not always.  A lot of VCs would have rejected\nMicrosoft.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/convince.html#f9n\"><font color=\"#999999\">9</font></a>]</font>\nCertainly some rejected Google.  And getting\nrejected will put you in a slightly awkward position, because as\nyou'll see when you start fundraising, the most common question\nyou'll get from investors will be \"who else is investing?\" What do\nyou say if you've been fundraising for a while and no one has\ncommitted yet? \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/convince.html#f10n\"><font color=\"#999999\">10</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The people who are really good at acting formidable often solve\nthis problem by giving investors the impression that while no\ninvestors have committed yet, several are about to.  This is arguably\na permissible tactic.  It's slightly dickish of investors to care\nmore about who else is investing than any other aspect of your\nstartup, and misleading them about how far along you are with other\ninvestors seems the complementary countermove.  It's arguably an\ninstance of scamming a scammer. But I don't recommend this approach\nto most founders, because most founders wouldn't be able to carry\nit off.  This is the single most common lie told to investors, and\nyou have to be really good at lying to tell members of some profession\nthe most common lie they're told.<br/><br/>If you're not a master of negotiation (and perhaps even if you are)\nthe best solution is to tackle the problem head-on, and to explain\nwhy investors have turned you down and why they're mistaken.  If\nyou know you're on the right track, then you also know why investors\nwere wrong to reject you. Experienced investors are well aware that\nthe best ideas are also the scariest.  They all know about the VCs\nwho rejected Google.  If instead of seeming evasive and ashamed\nabout having been turned down (and thereby implicitly agreeing with\nthe verdict) you talk candidly about what scared investors about\nyou, you'll seem more confident, which they like, and you'll probably\nalso do a better job of presenting that aspect of your startup.  At\nthe very least, that worry will now be out in the open instead of\nbeing a gotcha left to be discovered by the investors you're currently\ntalking to, who will be proud of and thus attached to their discovery.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/convince.html#f11n\"><font color=\"#999999\">11</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>This strategy will work best with the best investors, who are both\nhard to bluff and who already believe most other investors are\nconventional-minded drones doomed always to miss the big outliers.\nRaising money is not like applying to college, where you can assume\nthat if you can get into MIT, you can also get into Foobar State.\nBecause the best investors are much smarter than the rest, and the\nbest startup ideas look initially like \n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html\">bad ideas</a>, it's not uncommon\nfor a startup to be rejected by all the VCs except the best ones.\nThat's what happened to Dropbox.  Y Combinator started in Boston,\nand for the first 3 years we ran alternating batches in Boston and\nSilicon Valley.  Because Boston investors were so few and so timid,\nwe used to ship Boston batches out for a second Demo Day in Silicon\nValley.  Dropbox was part of a Boston batch, which means all those\nBoston investors got the first look at Dropbox, and none of them\nclosed the deal.  Yet another backup and syncing thing, they all\nthought.  A couple weeks later, Dropbox raised a series A round\nfrom Sequoia.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/convince.html#f12n\"><font color=\"#999999\">12</font></a>]</font><br/><br/><b>Different</b><br/><br/>Not understanding that investors view investments as bets combines\nwith the ten page paper mentality to prevent founders from even\nconsidering the possibility of being certain of what they're saying.\nThey think they're trying to convince investors of something very\nuncertain — that their startup will be huge — and convincing anyone\nof something like that must obviously entail some wild feat of\nsalesmanship.  But in fact when you raise money you're trying to\nconvince investors of something so much less speculative — whether\nthe company has all the elements of a good bet — that you can\napproach the problem in a qualitatively different way.  You can\nconvince yourself, then convince them.<br/><br/>And when you convince them, use the same matter-of-fact language\nyou used to convince yourself.  You wouldn't use vague, grandiose\nmarketing-speak among yourselves.  Don't use it with investors\neither.  It not only doesn't work on them, but seems a mark of\nincompetence.  Just be concise.  Many investors explicitly use that\nas a test, reasoning (correctly) that if you can't explain your\nplans concisely, you don't really understand them.  But even investors\nwho don't have a rule about this will be bored and frustrated by\nunclear explanations.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/convince.html#f13n\"><font color=\"#999999\">13</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>So here's the recipe for impressing investors when you're not already\ngood at seeming formidable:\n<ol>\n<li> Make something worth investing in.<br/><br/><li> Understand why it's worth investing in.<br/><br/><li> Explain that clearly to investors.\n</li></li></li></ol>\nIf you're saying something you know is true, you'll seem confident\nwhen you're saying it.  Conversely, never let pitching draw you\ninto bullshitting.  As long as you stay on the territory of truth,\nyou're strong.  Make the truth good, then just tell it.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nThere's no reason to believe this number is a constant.  In\nfact it's our explicit goal at Y Combinator to increase it, by\nencouraging people to start startups who otherwise wouldn't have.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nOr more precisely, investors decide whether you're a loser\nor possibly a winner.  If you seem like a winner, they may then,\ndepending on how much you're raising, have several more meetings\nwith you to test whether that initial impression holds up.<br/><br/>But if you seem like a loser they're done, at least for the next\nyear or so.  And when they decide you're a loser they usually decide\nin way less than the 50 minutes they may have allotted for the first\nmeeting.  Which explains the astonished stories one always hears\nabout VC inattentiveness.  How could these people make investment\ndecisions well when they're checking their messages during startups'\npresentations?  The solution to that mystery is that they've already\nmade the decision.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nThe two are not mutually exclusive.  There are people who are\nboth genuinely formidable, and also really good at acting that way.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f4n\"><font color=\"#000000\">4</font></a>]\nHow can people who will go on to create giant companies not\nseem formidable early on?  I think the main reason is that their\nexperience so far has trained them to keep their wings folded, as\nit were.  Family, school, and jobs encourage cooperation, not\nconquest.  And it's just as well they do, because even being Genghis\nKhan is probably 99% cooperation.  But the result is that most\npeople emerge from the tube of their upbringing in their early\ntwenties compressed into the shape of the tube.  Some find they\nhave wings and start to spread them.  But this takes a few years.\nIn the beginning even they don't know yet what they're capable of.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f5n\"><font color=\"#000000\">5</font></a>]\nIn fact, change what you're doing.  You're investing your own\ntime in your startup.  If you're not convinced that what you're\nworking on is a sufficiently good bet, why are you even working on\nthat?<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f6n\"><font color=\"#000000\">6</font></a>]\nWhen investors ask you a question you don't know the answer\nto, the best response is neither to bluff nor give up, but instead\nto explain how you'd figure out the answer.  If you can work out a\npreliminary answer on the spot, so much the better, but explain\nthat's what you're doing.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f7n\"><font color=\"#000000\">7</font></a>]\nAt YC we try to ensure startups are ready to raise money on\nDemo Day by encouraging them to ignore investors and instead focus\non their companies till about a week before.  That way most reach\nthe stage where they're sufficiently convincing well before Demo\nDay.  But not all do, so we also give any startup that wants to the\noption of deferring to a later Demo Day.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f8n\"><font color=\"#000000\">8</font></a>]\nFounders are often surprised by how much harder it is to raise\nthe next round.  There is a qualitative difference in investors'\nattitudes.  It's like the difference between being judged as a kid\nand as an adult.  The next time you raise money, it's not enough\nto be promising.  You have to be delivering results.<br/><br/>So although it works well to show growth graphs at either stage,\ninvestors treat them differently.  At three months, a growth graph\nis mostly evidence that the founders are effective.  At two years,\nit has to be evidence of a promising market and a company tuned to\nexploit it.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f9n\"><font color=\"#000000\">9</font></a>]\nBy this I mean that if the present day equivalent of the 3\nmonth old Microsoft presented at a Demo Day, there would be investors\nwho turned them down.  Microsoft itself didn't raise outside money,\nand indeed the venture business barely existed when they got started\nin 1975.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f10n\"><font color=\"#000000\">10</font></a>]\nThe best investors rarely care who else is investing, but\nmediocre investors almost all do.  So you can use this question as\na test of investor quality.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f11n\"><font color=\"#000000\">11</font></a>]\nTo use this technique, you'll have to find out why investors\nwho rejected you did so, or at least what they claim was the reason.\nThat may require asking, because investors don't always volunteer\na lot of detail.  Make it clear when you ask that you're not trying\nto dispute their decision — just that if there is some weakness in\nyour plans, you need to know about it.  You won't always get a real\nreason out of them, but you should at least try.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f12n\"><font color=\"#000000\">12</font></a>]\nDropbox wasn't rejected by all the East Coast VCs.  There was\none firm that wanted to invest but tried to lowball them.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f13n\"><font color=\"#000000\">13</font></a>]\nAlfred Lin points out that it's doubly important for the\nexplanation of a startup to be clear and concise, because it has\nto convince at one remove: it has to work not just on the partner\nyou talk to, but when that partner re-tells it to colleagues.<br/><br/>We consciously optimize for this at YC.  When we work with founders\ncreate a Demo Day pitch, the last step is to imagine how an investor\nwould sell it to colleagues.<br/><br/>\n<b>Thanks</b> to Marc Andreessen, Sam Altman, Patrick Collison, Ron Conway,\nChris Dixon, Alfred Lin, Ben Horowitz, Steve Huffman, Jessica\nLivingston, Greg Mcadoo, Andrew Mason, Geoff Ralston, Yuri Sagalov,\nEmmett Shear, Rajat Suri, Garry Tan, Albert Wenger, Fred Wilson,\nand Qasar Younis for reading drafts of this.<br/><br/><br/><br/></br></p></font>","date":"2013-08-01T00:00:00Z"}
