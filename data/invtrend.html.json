{"href":"invtrend.html","title":"Startup Investing Trends","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">June 2013<br/><br/><i>(This talk was written for an audience of investors.)</i><br/><br/>Y Combinator has now funded 564 startups including the current\nbatch, which has 53.  The total valuation of the 287 that have\nvaluations (either by raising an equity round, getting acquired,\nor dying) is about $11.7 billion, and the 511 prior to the current\nbatch have collectively raised about $1.7 billion.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f1n\"><font color=\"#999999\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>As usual those numbers are dominated by a few big winners.  The top\n10 startups account for 8.6 of that 11.7 billion.  But there is a\npeloton of younger startups behind them.  There are about 40 more\nthat have a shot at being really big.<br/><br/>Things got a little out of hand last summer when we had 84 companies\nin the batch, so we tightened up our filter to decrease the batch\nsize. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f2n\"><font color=\"#999999\">2</font></a>]</font>\nSeveral journalists have tried to interpret that as\nevidence for some macro story they were telling, but the reason had\nnothing to do with any external trend.  The reason was that we\ndiscovered we were using an nÂ² algorithm, and we needed to buy\ntime to fix it.  Fortunately we've come up with several techniques\nfor sharding YC, and the problem now seems to be fixed.  With a new\nmore scaleable model and only 53 companies, the current batch feels\nlike a walk in the park.  I'd guess we can grow another 2 or 3x\nbefore hitting the next bottleneck. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f3n\"><font color=\"#999999\">3</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>One consequence of funding such a large number of startups is that\nwe see trends early.  And since fundraising is one of the main\nthings we help startups with, we're in a good position to notice\ntrends in investing.<br/><br/>I'm going to take a shot at describing where these trends are\nleading.  Let's start with the most basic question: will the future\nbe better or worse than the past?  Will investors, in the aggregate,\nmake more money or less?<br/><br/>I think more.  There are multiple forces at work, some of which\nwill decrease returns, and some of which will increase them.  I\ncan't predict for sure which forces will prevail, but I'll describe\nthem and you can decide for yourself.<br/><br/>There are two big forces driving change in startup funding: it's\nbecoming cheaper to start a startup, and startups are becoming a\nmore normal thing to do.<br/><br/>When I graduated from college in 1986, there were essentially two\noptions: get a job or go to grad school.  Now there's a third: start\nyour own company.\nThat's a big change.  In principle it was possible to start your\nown company in 1986 too, but it didn't seem like a real possibility.\nIt seemed possible to start a consulting company, or a niche product\ncompany, but it didn't seem possible to start a company that would\nbecome big.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f4n\"><font color=\"#999999\">4</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>That kind of change, from 2 paths to 3, is the sort of big social\nshift that only happens once every few generations.  I think we're\nstill at the beginning of this one.  It's hard to predict how big\na deal it will be.  As big a deal as the Industrial Revolution?\nMaybe.  Probably not.  But it will be a big enough deal that it\ntakes almost everyone by surprise, because those big social shifts\nalways do.<br/><br/>One thing we can say for sure is that there will be a lot more\nstartups.  The monolithic, hierarchical companies of the mid 20th\ncentury are being <a href=\"highres.html\">replaced</a> by networks\nof smaller companies.  This process is not just something happening\nnow in Silicon Valley.  It started decades ago, and it's happening\nas far afield as the car industry.  It has a long way to run. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f5n\"><font color=\"#999999\">5</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>\nThe other big driver of change is that startups are becoming cheaper\nto start.  And in fact the two forces are related: the decreasing\ncost of starting a startup is one of the reasons startups are\nbecoming a more normal thing to do.<br/><br/>The fact that startups need less money means founders will increasingly\nhave the upper hand over investors.  You still need just as much\nof their energy and imagination, but they don't need as much of\nyour money.  Because founders have the upper hand, they'll retain\nan increasingly large share of the stock in, and <a href=\"control.html\">control of</a>, their\ncompanies.  Which means investors will get less stock and less\ncontrol.<br/><br/>Does that mean investors will make less money?  Not necessarily,\nbecause there will be more good startups.  The total amount of\ndesirable startup stock available to investors will probably increase,\nbecause the number of desirable startups will probably grow faster\nthan the percentage they sell to investors shrinks.<br/><br/>There's a rule of thumb in the VC business that there are about 15\ncompanies a year that will be really successful.  Although a lot\nof investors unconsciously treat this number as if it were some\nsort of cosmological constant, I'm certain it isn't.   There are\nprobably limits on the rate at which technology can develop, but\nthat's not the limiting factor now.  If it were, each successful\nstartup would be founded the month it became possible, and that is\nnot the case. Right now the limiting factor on the number of big\nhits is the number of sufficiently good founders starting companies,\nand that number can and will increase.  There are still a lot of\npeople who'd make great founders who never end up starting a company.\nYou can see that from how randomly some of the most successful\nstartups got started.  So many of the biggest startups almost didn't\nhappen that there must be a lot of equally good startups that\nactually didn't happen.<br/><br/>There might be 10x or even 50x more good founders out there.  As\nmore of them go ahead and start startups, those 15 big hits a year\ncould easily become 50 or even 100.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f6n\"><font color=\"#999999\">6</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>What about returns, though?  Are we heading for a world in which\nreturns will be pinched by increasingly high valuations?  I think\nthe top firms will actually make more money than they have in the\npast.  High returns don't come from investing at low valuations.\nThey come from investing in the companies that do really well.  So\nif there are more of those to be had each year, the best pickers\nshould have more hits.<br/><br/>This means there should be more variability in the VC business.\nThe firms that can recognize and attract the best startups will do\neven better, because there will be more of them to recognize and\nattract.  Whereas the bad firms will get the leftovers, as they do\nnow, and yet pay a higher price for them.<br/><br/>Nor do I think it will be a problem that founders keep control of\ntheir companies for longer.  The empirical evidence on that is\nalready clear: investors make more money as founders' bitches than\ntheir bosses.  Though somewhat humiliating, this is actually good\nnews for investors, because it takes less time to serve founders\nthan to micromanage them.<br/><br/>What about angels?  I think there is a lot of opportunity there.\nIt used to suck to be an angel investor.  You couldn't get access\nto the best deals, unless you got lucky like Andy Bechtolsheim, and\nwhen you did invest in a startup, VCs might try to strip you of\nyour stock when they arrived later.  Now an angel can go to something\nlike Demo Day or AngelList and have access to the same deals VCs\ndo.  And the days when VCs could wash angels out of the cap table\nare long gone.<br/><br/>I think one of the biggest unexploited opportunities in startup\ninvesting right now is angel-sized investments made quickly.  Few\ninvestors understand the cost that raising money from them imposes\non startups.  When the company consists only of the founders,\neverything grinds to a halt during fundraising, which can easily\ntake 6 weeks.  The current high cost of fundraising means there is\nroom for low-cost investors to undercut the rest.  And in this\ncontext, low-cost means deciding quickly.  If there were a reputable\ninvestor who invested $100k on good terms and promised to decide\nyes or no within 24 hours, they'd get access to almost all the best\ndeals, because every good startup would approach them first.  It\nwould be up to them to pick, because every bad startup would approach\nthem first too, but at least they'd see everything.  Whereas if an\ninvestor is notorious for taking a long time to make up their mind\nor negotiating a lot about valuation, founders will save them for\nlast.  And in the case of the most promising startups, which tend\nto have an easy time raising money, last can easily become never.<br/><br/>Will the number of big hits grow linearly with the total number of\nnew startups?  Probably not, for two reasons.  One is that the\nscariness of starting a startup in the old days was a pretty effective\nfilter.  Now that the cost of failing is becoming lower, we should\nexpect founders to do it more.  That's not a bad thing.  It's common\nin technology for an innovation that decreases the cost of failure\nto increase the number of failures and yet leave you net ahead.<br/><br/>The other reason the number of big hits won't grow proportionately\nto the number of startups is that there will start to be an increasing\nnumber of idea clashes.  Although the finiteness of the number of\ngood ideas is not the reason there are only 15 big hits a year, the\nnumber has to be finite, and the more startups there are, the more\nwe'll see multiple companies doing the same thing at the same time.\nIt will be interesting, in a bad way, if idea clashes become a lot\nmore common. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f7n\"><font color=\"#999999\">7</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Mostly because of the increasing number of early failures, the startup\nbusiness of the future won't simply be the same shape, scaled up.\nWhat used to be an obelisk will become a pyramid.  It will be a\nlittle wider at the top, but a lot wider at the bottom.<br/><br/>What does that mean for investors?  One thing it means is that there\nwill be more opportunities for investors at the earliest stage,\nbecause that's where the volume of our imaginary solid is growing\nfastest.  Imagine the obelisk of investors that corresponds to\nthe obelisk of startups.  As it widens out into a pyramid to match\nthe startup pyramid, all the contents are adhering to the top,\nleaving a vacuum at the bottom.<br/><br/>That opportunity for investors mostly means an opportunity for new\ninvestors, because the degree of risk an existing investor or firm\nis comfortable taking is one of the hardest things for them to\nchange.  Different types of investors are adapted to different\ndegrees of risk, but each has its specific degree of risk deeply\nimprinted on it, not just in the procedures they follow but in the\npersonalities of the people who work there.<br/><br/>I think the biggest danger for VCs, and also the biggest opportunity,\nis at the series A stage.  Or rather, what used to be the series A\nstage before series As turned into de facto series B rounds.<br/><br/>Right now, VCs often knowingly invest too much money at the series\nA stage.  They do it because they feel they need to get a big chunk\nof each series A company to compensate for the opportunity cost of\nthe board seat it consumes.  Which means when there is a lot of\ncompetition for a deal, the number that moves is the valuation (and\nthus amount invested) rather than the percentage of the company\nbeing sold.  Which means, especially in the case of more promising\nstartups, that series A investors often make companies take more\nmoney than they want.<br/><br/>Some VCs lie and claim the company really needs that much.  Others\nare more candid, and admit their financial models require them to\nown a certain percentage of each company.  But we all know the\namounts being raised in series A rounds are not determined by asking\nwhat would be best for the companies.  They're determined by VCs\nstarting from the amount of the company they want to own, and the\nmarket setting the valuation and thus the amount invested.<br/><br/>Like a lot of bad things, this didn't happen intentionally.  The\nVC business backed into it as their initial assumptions gradually\nbecame obsolete.  The traditions and financial models of the VC\nbusiness were established when founders needed investors more.  In\nthose days it was natural for founders to sell VCs a big chunk of\ntheir company in the series A round.  Now founders would prefer to\nsell less, and VCs are digging in their heels because they're not\nsure if they can make money buying less than 20% of each series A\ncompany.<br/><br/>The reason I describe this as a danger is that series A investors\nare increasingly at odds with the startups they supposedly serve,\nand that tends to come back to bite you eventually.  The reason I\ndescribe it as an opportunity is that there is now a lot of potential\nenergy built up, as the market has moved away from VCs' traditional\nbusiness model.  Which means the first VC to break ranks and start\nto do series A rounds for as much equity as founders want to sell\n(and with no \"option pool\" that comes only from the founders' shares)\nstands to reap huge benefits.<br/><br/>What will happen to the VC business when that happens?  Hell if I\nknow.  But I bet that particular firm will end up ahead.  If one\ntop-tier VC firm started to do series A rounds that started from\nthe amount the company needed to raise and let the percentage\nacquired vary with the market, instead of the other way around,\nthey'd instantly get almost all the best startups.  And that's where\nthe money is.<br/><br/>You can't fight market forces forever.  Over the last decade we've\nseen the percentage of the company sold in series A rounds creep\ninexorably downward.  40% used to be common.  Now VCs are fighting\nto hold the line at 20%.  But I am daily waiting for the line to\ncollapse.  It's going to happen.  You may as well anticipate it,\nand look bold.<br/><br/>Who knows, maybe VCs will make more money by doing the right thing.\nIt wouldn't be the first time that happened.  Venture capital is a\nbusiness where occasional big successes generate hundredfold returns.\nHow much confidence can you really have in financial models for\nsomething like that anyway?  The\nbig successes only have to get a tiny bit less occasional to\ncompensate for a 2x decrease in the stock sold in series A rounds.<br/><br/>If you want to find new opportunities for investing, look for things\nfounders complain about.  Founders are your customers, and the\nthings they complain about are unsatisfied demand.  I've given two\nexamples of things founders complain about mostâinvestors who\ntake too long to make up their minds, and excessive dilution in\nseries A roundsâso those are good places to look now.  But\nthe more general recipe is: do something founders want.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nI realize revenue and not fundraising is the proper test of\nsuccess for a startup.  The reason we quote statistics about\nfundraising is because those are the numbers we have.  We couldn't\ntalk meaningfully about revenues without including the numbers from\nthe most successful startups, and we don't have those.  We often\ndiscuss revenue growth with the earlier stage startups, because\nthat's how we gauge their progress, but when companies reach a\ncertain size it gets presumptuous for a seed investor to do that.<br/><br/>In any case, companies' market caps do eventually become a function\nof revenues, and post-money valuations of funding rounds are at\nleast guesses by pros about where those market caps will end up.<br/><br/>The reason only 287 have valuations is that the rest have mostly\nraised money on convertible notes, and although convertible notes\noften have valuation caps, a valuation cap is merely an upper bound\non a valuation.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nWe didn't try to accept a particular number.  We have no way\nof doing that even if we wanted to.  We just tried to be significantly\npickier.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nThough you never know with bottlenecks, I'm guessing the next\none will be coordinating efforts among partners.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f4n\"><font color=\"#000000\">4</font></a>]\nI realize starting a company doesn't have to mean starting a\n<a href=\"growth.html\">startup</a>.  There will be lots of people starting normal companies\ntoo.  But that's not relevant to an audience of investors.<br/><br/>Geoff Ralston reports that in Silicon Valley it seemed thinkable\nto start a startup in the mid 1980s.  It would have started there.\nBut I know it didn't to undergraduates on the East Coast.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f5n\"><font color=\"#000000\">5</font></a>]\nThis trend is one of the main causes of the increase in\neconomic inequality in the US since the mid twentieth century.  The\nperson who would in 1950 have been the general manager of the x\ndivision of Megacorp is now the founder of the x company, and owns\nsignificant equity in it.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f6n\"><font color=\"#000000\">6</font></a>]\nIf Congress passes the <a href=\"foundervisa.html\">founder\nvisa</a> in a non-broken form, that alone could in principle get\nus up to 20x, since 95% of the world's population lives outside the\nUS.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f7n\"><font color=\"#000000\">7</font></a>]\nIf idea clashes got bad enough, it could change what it means\nto be a startup.  We currently advise startups mostly to ignore\ncompetitors.  We tell them startups are competitive like running,\nnot like soccer; you don't have to go and steal the ball away from\nthe other team.  But if idea clashes became common enough, maybe\nyou'd start to have to.  That would be unfortunate.<br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Dalton Caldwell,\nPatrick Collison, Jessica\nLivingston, Andrew Mason, Geoff Ralston, and Garry Tan for reading\ndrafts of this.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2013-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
