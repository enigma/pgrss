Being newly founded\ndoes not in itself make a company a startup.  Nor is it necessary\nfor a startup to work on technology, or take venture funding, or\nhave some sort of \"exit.\"  The only essential thing is growth.\nEverything else we associate with startups follows from growth.<br/><br/>If you want to start one it's important to understand that. Startups\nare so hard that you can't be pointed off to the side and hope to\nsucceed.  You have to know that growth is what you're after.  The\ngood news is, if you get growth, everything else tends to fall into\nplace.  Which means you can use growth like a compass to make almost\nevery decision you face.<br/><br/>\n<b>Redwoods</b><br/><br/>Let's start with a distinction that should be obvious but is often\noverlooked: not every newly founded company is a startup.  Millions\nof companies are started every year in the US.  Only a tiny fraction\nare startups.  Most are service businesses — restaurants, barbershops,\nplumbers, and so on.  These are not startups, except in a few unusual\ncases.  A barbershop isn't designed to grow fast.  Whereas a search\nengine, for example, is.<br/><br/>When I say startups are designed to grow fast, I mean it in two\nsenses.  Partly I mean designed in the sense of intended, because\nmost startups fail.  But I also mean startups are different by\nnature, in the same way a redwood seedling has a different destiny\nfrom a bean sprout.<br/><br/>That difference is why there's a distinct word, \"startup,\" for\ncompanies designed to grow fast.  If all companies were essentially\nsimilar, but some through luck or the efforts of their founders\nended up growing very fast, we wouldn't need a separate word.  We\ncould just talk about super-successful companies and less successful\nones.  But in fact startups do have a different sort of DNA from\nother businesses.  Google is not just a barbershop whose founders\nwere unusually lucky and hard-working.  Google was different from\nthe beginning.<br/><br/>To grow rapidly, you need to make something you can sell to a big\nmarket.  That's the difference between Google and a barbershop.  A\nbarbershop doesn't scale.<br/><br/>For a company to grow really big, it must (a) make something lots\nof people want, and (b) reach and serve all those people.  Barbershops\nare doing fine in the (a) department.  Almost everyone needs their\nhair cut.  The problem for a barbershop, as for any retail\nestablishment, is (b).  A barbershop serves customers in person,\nand few will travel far for a haircut.  And even if they did, the\nbarbershop couldn't accomodate them. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/growth.html#f1n\"><font color=\"#999999\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Writing software is a great way to solve (b), but you can still end\nup constrained in (a).  If you write software to teach Tibetan to\nHungarian speakers, you'll be able to reach most of the people who\nwant it, but there won't be many of them.   If you make software\nto teach English to Chinese speakers, however, you're in startup\nterritory.<br/><br/>Most businesses are tightly constrained in (a) or (b).  The distinctive\nfeature of successful startups is that they're not.<br/><br/>\n<b>Ideas</b><br/><br/>It might seem that it would always be better to start a startup\nthan an ordinary business.  If you're going to start a company, why\nnot start the type with the most potential?  The catch is that this\nis a (fairly) efficient market.   If you write software to teach\nTibetan to Hungarians, you won't have much competition.  If you\nwrite software to teach English to Chinese speakers, you'll face\nferocious competition, precisely because that's such a larger prize.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/growth.html#f2n\"><font color=\"#999999\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The constraints that limit ordinary companies also protect them.\nThat's the tradeoff.  If you start a barbershop, you only have to\ncompete with other local barbers.  If you start a search engine you\nhave to compete with the whole world.<br/><br/>The most important thing that the constraints on a normal business\nprotect it from is not competition, however, but the difficulty of\ncoming up with new ideas.  If you open a bar in a particular\nneighborhood, as well as limiting your potential and protecting you\nfrom competitors, that geographic constraint also helps define your\ncompany.  Bar + neighborhood is a sufficient idea for a small\nbusiness.  Similarly for companies constrained in (a).  Your niche\nboth protects and defines you.<br/><br/>Whereas if you want to start a startup, you're probably going to\nhave to think of something fairly novel.  A startup has to make\nsomething it can deliver to a large market, and ideas of that type\nare so valuable that all the obvious ones are already taken.<br/><br/>That space of ideas has been so thoroughly picked over that a startup\ngenerally has to work on something everyone else has overlooked.\nI was going to write that one has to make a conscious effort to\nfind ideas everyone else has overlooked.  But that's not how most\nstartups get started.  Usually successful startups happen because\nthe founders are sufficiently different from other people that ideas\nfew others can see seem obvious to them.  Perhaps later they step\nback and notice they've found an idea in everyone else's blind spot,\nand from that point make a deliberate effort to stay there. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/growth.html#f3n\"><font color=\"#999999\">3</font></a>]</font>\nBut at the moment when successful startups get started, much of the\ninnovation is unconscious.<br/><br/>What's different about successful founders is that they can see\ndifferent problems.  It's a particularly good combination both to\nbe good at technology and to face problems that can be solved by\nit, because technology changes so rapidly that formerly bad ideas\noften become good without anyone noticing.  Steve Wozniak's problem\nwas that he wanted his own computer.  That was an unusual problem\nto have in 1975.  But technological change was about to make it a\nmuch more common one.  Because he not only wanted a computer but\nknew how to build them, Wozniak was able to make himself one.  And\nthe problem he solved for himself became one that Apple solved for\nmillions of people in the coming years.  But by the time it was\nobvious to ordinary people that this was a big market, Apple was\nalready established.<br/><br/>Google has similar origins.  Larry Page and Sergey Brin wanted to\nsearch the web.  But unlike most people they had the technical\nexpertise both to notice that existing search engines were not as\ngood as they could be, and to know how to improve them.  Over the\nnext few years their problem became everyone's problem, as the web\ngrew to a size where you didn't have to be a picky search expert\nto notice the old algorithms weren't good enough.  But as happened\nwith Apple, by the time everyone else realized how important search\nwas, Google was entrenched.<br/><br/>That's one connection between startup ideas and technology.  Rapid\nchange in one area uncovers big, soluble problems in other areas.\nSometimes the changes are advances, and what they change is solubility.\nThat was the kind of change that yielded Apple; advances in chip\ntechnology finally let Steve Wozniak design a computer he could\nafford.  But in Google's case the most important change was the\ngrowth of the web. What changed there was not solubility but bigness.<br/><br/>The other connection between startups and technology is that startups\ncreate new ways of doing things, and new ways of doing things are,\nin the broader sense of the word, new technology.  \nWhen a startup both begins with an\nidea exposed by technological change and makes a product consisting\nof technology in the narrower sense (what used to be called \"high\ntechnology\"), it's easy to conflate the two.  But the two connections\nare distinct and in principle one could start a startup that was\nneither driven by technological change, nor whose product consisted\nof technology except in the broader sense. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/growth.html#f4n\"><font color=\"#999999\">4</font></a>]</font><br/><br/><b>Rate</b><br/><br/>How fast does a company have to grow to be considered a startup?\nThere's no precise answer to that.  \"Startup\" is a pole, not a\nthreshold.  Starting one is at first no more than a declaration of\none's ambitions.  You're committing not just to starting a company,\nbut to starting a fast growing one, and you're thus committing to\nsearch for one of the rare ideas of that type.  But at first you\nhave no more than commitment.  Starting a startup is like being an\nactor in that respect.  \"Actor\" too is a pole rather than a threshold.\nAt the beginning of his career, an actor is a waiter who goes to\nauditions.  Getting work makes him a successful actor, but he doesn't\nonly become an actor when he's successful.<br/><br/>So the real question is not what growth rate makes a company a\nstartup, but what growth rate successful startups tend to have.\nFor founders that's more than a theoretical question, because it's\nequivalent to asking if they're on the right path.<br/><br/>The growth of a successful startup usually has three phases:\n<ol>\n<li> There's an initial period of slow or no growth while the startup\n  tries to figure out what it's doing.<br/><br/><li> As the startup figures out how to make something lots of people\n  want and how to reach those people, there's a period of rapid\n  growth.<br/><br/><li> Eventually a successful startup will grow into a big company.\n  Growth will slow, partly due to internal limits and partly because\n  the company is starting to bump up against the limits of the\n  markets it serves.  \n  <font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/growth.html#f5n\"><font color=\"#999999\">5</font></a>]</font>\n</li></li></li></ol>\nTogether these three phases produce an S-curve.  The phase whose\ngrowth defines the startup is the second one, the ascent.  Its\nlength and slope determine how big the company will be.<br/><br/>The slope is the company's growth rate.  If there's one number every\nfounder should always know, it's the company's growth rate.  That's\nthe measure of a startup.  If you don't know that number, you don't\neven know if you're doing well or badly.<br/><br/>When I first meet founders and ask what their growth rate is,\nsometimes they tell me \"we get about a hundred new customers a\nmonth.\"  That's not a rate.  What matters is not the absolute number\nof new customers, but the ratio of new customers to existing ones.\nIf you're really getting a constant number of new customers every\nmonth, you're in trouble, because that means your growth rate is\ndecreasing.<br/><br/>During Y Combinator we measure growth rate per week, partly because\nthere is so little time before Demo Day, and partly because startups\nearly on need frequent feedback from their users to tweak what\nthey're doing. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/growth.html#f6n\"><font color=\"#999999\">6</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>A good growth rate during YC is 5-7% a week.  If you can hit 10% a\nweek you're doing exceptionally well.  If you can only manage 1%,\nit's a sign you haven't yet figured out what you're doing.<br/><br/>The best thing to measure the growth rate of is revenue.  The next\nbest, for startups that aren't charging initially, is active users.\nThat's a reasonable proxy for revenue growth because whenever the\nstartup does start trying to make money, their revenues will probably\nbe a constant multiple of active users. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/growth.html#f7n\"><font color=\"#999999\">7</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>\n<b>Compass</b><br/><br/>We usually advise startups to pick a growth rate they think they\ncan hit, and then just try to hit it every week.  The key word here\nis \"just.\" If they decide to grow at 7% a week and they hit that\nnumber, they're successful for that week.  There's nothing more\nthey need to do.  But if they don't hit it, they've failed in the\nonly thing that mattered, and should be correspondingly alarmed.<br/><br/>Programmers will recognize what we're doing here.  We're turning\nstarting a startup into an optimization problem.  And anyone who\nhas tried optimizing code knows how wonderfully effective that sort\nof narrow focus can be.  Optimizing code means taking an existing\nprogram and changing it to use less of something, usually time or\nmemory.  You don't have to think about what the program should do,\njust make it faster.  For most programmers this is very satisfying\nwork.  The narrow focus makes it a sort of puzzle, and you're\ngenerally surprised how fast you can solve it.<br/><br/>Focusing on hitting a growth rate reduces the otherwise bewilderingly\nmultifarious problem of starting a startup to a single problem.\nYou can use that target growth rate to make all your decisions for\nyou; anything that gets you the growth you need is ipso facto right.\nShould you spend two days at a conference?  Should you hire another\nprogrammer?  Should you focus more on marketing?  Should you spend\ntime courting some big customer?  Should you add x feature? Whatever\ngets you your target growth rate. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/growth.html#f8n\"><font color=\"#999999\">8</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Judging yourself by weekly growth doesn't mean you can look no more\nthan a week ahead.  Once you experience the pain of missing your\ntarget one week (it was the only thing that mattered, and you failed\nat it), you become interested in anything that could spare you such\npain in the future.  So you'll be willing for example to hire another\nprogrammer, who won't contribute to this week's growth but perhaps\nin a month will have implemented some new feature that will get you\nmore users.   But only if (a) the distraction of hiring someone\nwon't make you miss your numbers in the short term, and (b) you're\nsufficiently worried about whether you can keep hitting your numbers\nwithout hiring someone new.<br/><br/>It's not that you don't think about the future, just that you think\nabout it no more than necessary.<br/><br/>In theory this sort of hill-climbing could get a startup into\ntrouble.  They could end up on a local maximum.  But in practice\nthat never happens.  Having to hit a growth number every week forces\nfounders to act, and acting versus not acting is the high bit of\nsucceeding.  Nine times out of ten, sitting around strategizing is\njust a form of procrastination.  Whereas founders' intuitions about\nwhich hill to climb are usually better than they realize.  Plus the\nmaxima in the space of startup ideas are not spiky and isolated.\nMost fairly good ideas are adjacent to even better ones.<br/><br/>The fascinating thing about optimizing for growth is that it can\nactually discover startup ideas.  You can use the need for growth\nas a form of evolutionary pressure.  If you start out with some\ninitial plan and modify it as necessary to keep hitting, say, 10%\nweekly growth, you may end up with a quite different company than\nyou meant to start.  But anything that grows consistently at 10% a\nweek is almost certainly a better idea than you started with.<br/><br/>There's a parallel here to small businesses.  Just as the constraint\nof being located in a particular neighborhood helps define a bar,\nthe constraint of growing at a certain rate can help define a\nstartup.<br/><br/>You'll generally do best to follow that constraint wherever it leads\nrather than being influenced by some initial vision, just as a\nscientist is better off following the truth wherever it leads rather\nthan being influenced by what he wishes were the case.  When Richard\nFeynman said that the imagination of nature was greater than the\nimagination of man, he meant that if you just keep following the\ntruth you'll discover cooler things than you could ever have made\nup. For startups, growth is a constraint much like truth. Every\nsuccessful startup is at least partly a product of the imagination\nof growth.  \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/growth.html#f9n\"><font color=\"#999999\">9</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>\n<b>Value</b><br/><br/>It's hard to find something that grows consistently at several\npercent a week, but if you do you may have found something surprisingly\nvaluable.  If we project forward we see why.<br/><br/><center>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tr><td align=\"center\"><font size=\"2\">weekly<td align=\"center\"><font size=\"2\">yearly</font></td></font></td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\"><font size=\"2\">1%</font><td align=\"right\"><font size=\"2\">1.7x</font></td></td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\"><font size=\"2\">2%</font><td align=\"right\"><font size=\"2\">2.8x</font></td></td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\"><font size=\"2\">5%</font><td align=\"right\"><font size=\"2\">12.6x</font></td></td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\"><font size=\"2\">7%</font><td align=\"right\"><font size=\"2\">33.7x</font></td></td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\"><font size=\"2\">10%</font><td align=\"right\"><font size=\"2\">142.0x</font></td></td></tr>\n</table>\n</center>\n<p>\nA company that grows at 1% a week will grow 1.7x a year, whereas a\ncompany that grows at 5% a week will grow 12.6x.  A company making\n$1000 a month (a typical number early in YC) and growing at 1% a\nweek will 4 years later be making $7900 a month, which is less than\na good programmer makes in salary in Silicon Valley.  A startup\nthat grows at 5% a week will in 4 years be making $25 million a\nmonth. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/growth.html#f10n\"><font color=\"#999999\">10</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Our ancestors must rarely have encountered cases of exponential\ngrowth, because our intuitions are no guide here.  What happens\nto fast growing startups tends to surprise even the founders.<br/><br/>Small variations in growth rate produce qualitatively different\noutcomes.  That's why there's a separate word for startups, and why\nstartups do things that ordinary companies don't, like raising money\nand getting acquired.  And, strangely enough, it's also why they\nfail so frequently.<br/><br/>Considering how valuable a successful startup can become, anyone\nfamiliar with the concept of expected value would be surprised if\nthe failure rate weren't high.  If a successful startup could make\na founder $100 million, then even if the chance of succeeding were\nonly 1%, the expected value of starting one would be $1 million.\nAnd the probability of a group of sufficiently smart and determined\nfounders succeeding on that scale might be significantly over 1%.\nFor the right people — e.g. the young Bill Gates — the probability\nmight be 20% or even 50%.  So it's not surprising that so many want\nto take a shot at it.  In an efficient market, the number of failed\nstartups should be proportionate to the size of the successes.  And\nsince the latter is huge the former should be too. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/growth.html#f11n\"><font color=\"#999999\">11</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>What this means is that at any given time, the great majority of\nstartups will be working on something that's never going to go\nanywhere, and yet glorifying their doomed efforts with the grandiose\ntitle of \"startup.\"<br/><br/>This doesn't bother me.  It's the same with other high-beta vocations,\nlike being an actor or a novelist.  I've long since gotten used to\nit.  But it seems to bother a lot of people, particularly those\nwho've started ordinary businesses.  Many are annoyed that these\nso-called startups get all the attention, when hardly any of them\nwill amount to anything.<br/><br/>If they stepped back and looked at the whole picture they might be\nless indignant.  The mistake they're making is that by basing their\nopinions on anecdotal evidence they're implicitly judging by the\nmedian rather than the average.  If you judge by the median startup,\nthe whole concept of a startup seems like a fraud.  You have to\ninvent a bubble to explain why founders want to start them or\ninvestors want to fund them.  But it's a mistake to use the median\nin a domain with so much variation.  If you look at the average\noutcome rather than the median, you can understand why investors\nlike them, and why, if they aren't median people, it's a rational\nchoice for founders to start them.<br/><br/>\n<b>Deals</b><br/><br/>Why do investors like startups so much?  Why are they so hot to\ninvest in photo-sharing apps, rather than solid money-making\nbusinesses?  Not only for the obvious reason.<br/><br/>The test of any investment is the ratio of return to risk.  Startups\npass that test because although they're appallingly risky, the\nreturns when they do succeed are so high.  But that's not the only\nreason investors like startups.  An ordinary slower-growing business\nmight have just as good a ratio of return to risk, if both were\nlower.  So why are VCs interested only in high-growth companies?\nThe reason is that they get paid by getting their capital back,\nideally after the startup IPOs, or failing that when it's acquired.<br/><br/>The other way to get returns from an investment is in the form of\ndividends.  Why isn't there a parallel VC industry that invests in\nordinary companies in return for a percentage of their profits?\nBecause it's too easy for people who control a private company to\nfunnel its revenues to themselves (e.g. by buying overpriced\ncomponents from a supplier they control) while making it look like\nthe company is making little profit.  Anyone who invested in private\ncompanies in return for dividends would have to pay close attention\nto their books.<br/><br/>The reason VCs like to invest in startups is not simply the returns,\nbut also because such investments are so easy to oversee.  The\nfounders can't enrich themselves without also enriching the investors.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/growth.html#f12n\"><font color=\"#999999\">12</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Why do founders want to take the VCs' money?  Growth, again.  The\nconstraint between good ideas and growth operates in both directions.\nIt's not merely that you need a scalable idea to grow.  If you have\nsuch an idea and don't grow fast enough, competitors will.  Growing\ntoo slowly is particularly dangerous in a business with network\neffects, which the best startups usually have to some degree.<br/><br/>Almost every company needs some amount of funding to get started.\nBut startups often raise money even when they are or could be\nprofitable.  It might seem foolish to sell stock in a profitable\ncompany for less than you think it will later be worth, but it's\nno more foolish than buying insurance.  Fundamentally that's how\nthe most successful startups view fundraising.  They could grow the\ncompany on its own revenues, but the extra money and help supplied\nby VCs will let them grow even faster.  Raising money lets you\n<i>choose</i> your growth rate.<br/><br/>Money to grow faster is always at the command of the most successful\nstartups, because the VCs need them more than they need the VCs.\nA profitable startup could if it wanted just grow on its own revenues.\nGrowing slower might be slightly dangerous, but chances are it\nwouldn't kill them.  Whereas VCs need to invest in startups, and\nin particular the most successful startups, or they'll be out of\nbusiness.  Which means that any sufficiently promising startup will\nbe offered money on terms they'd be crazy to refuse.  And yet because\nof the scale of the successes in the startup business, VCs can still\nmake money from such investments.  You'd have to be crazy to believe\nyour company was going to become as valuable as a high growth rate\ncan make it, but some do.<br/><br/>Pretty much every successful startup will get acquisition offers\ntoo.  Why?  What is it about startups that makes other companies\nwant to buy them? \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/growth.html#f13n\"><font color=\"#999999\">13</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Fundamentally the same thing that makes everyone else want the stock\nof successful startups: a rapidly growing company is valuable.  It's\na good thing eBay bought Paypal, for example, because Paypal is now\nresponsible for 43% of their sales and probably more of their growth.<br/><br/>But acquirers have an additional reason to want startups.  A rapidly\ngrowing company is not merely valuable, but dangerous.  If it keeps\nexpanding, it might expand into the acquirer's own territory.  Most\nproduct acquisitions have some component of fear.  Even if an\nacquirer isn't threatened by the startup itself, they might be\nalarmed at the thought of what a competitor could do with it.  And\nbecause startups are in this sense doubly valuable to acquirers,\nacquirers will often pay more than an ordinary investor would. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/growth.html#f14n\"><font color=\"#999999\">14</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>\n<b>Understand</b><br/><br/>The combination of founders, investors, and acquirers forms a natural\necosystem.  It works so well that those who don't understand it are\ndriven to invent conspiracy theories to explain how neatly things\nsometimes turn out.  Just as our ancestors did to explain the\napparently too neat workings of the natural world.  But there is\nno secret cabal making it all work.<br/><br/>If you start from the mistaken assumption that Instagram was\nworthless, you have to invent a secret boss to force Mark Zuckerberg\nto buy it.  To anyone who knows Mark Zuckerberg, that is the reductio\nad absurdum of the initial assumption.  The reason he bought Instagram\nwas that it was valuable and dangerous, and what made it so was\ngrowth.<br/><br/>If you want to understand startups, understand growth.  Growth\ndrives everything in this world.  Growth is why startups usually\nwork on technology — because ideas for fast growing companies are\nso rare that the best way to find new ones is to discover those\nrecently made viable by change, and technology is the best source\nof rapid change.  Growth is why it's a rational choice economically\nfor so many founders to try starting a startup: growth makes the\nsuccessful companies so valuable that the expected value is high\neven though the risk is too.  Growth is why VCs want to invest in\nstartups: not just because the returns are high but also because\ngenerating returns from capital gains is easier to manage than\ngenerating returns from dividends.  Growth explains why the most\nsuccessful startups take VC money even if they don't need to: it\nlets them choose their growth rate.  And growth explains why\nsuccessful startups almost invariably get acquisition offers.  To\nacquirers a fast-growing company is not merely valuable but dangerous\ntoo.<br/><br/>It's not just that if you want to succeed in some domain, you have\nto understand the forces driving it.  Understanding growth is what\nstarting a startup <i>consists</i> of.  What you're really doing (and\nto the dismay of some observers, all you're really doing) when you\nstart a startup is committing to solve a harder type of problem\nthan ordinary businesses do.  You're committing to search for one\nof the rare ideas that generates rapid growth.  Because these ideas\nare so valuable, finding one is hard.  The startup is the embodiment\nof your discoveries so far.  Starting a startup is thus very much\nlike deciding to be a research scientist: you're not committing to\nsolve any specific problem; you don't know for sure which problems\nare soluble; but you're committing to try to discover something no\none knew before.  A startup founder is in effect an economic research\nscientist.  Most don't discover anything that remarkable, but some\ndiscover relativity.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nStrictly speaking it's not lots of customers you need but a big\nmarket, meaning a high product of number of customers times how\nmuch they'll pay.  But it's dangerous to have too few customers\neven if they pay a lot, or the power that individual customers have\nover you could turn you into a de facto consulting firm.  So whatever\nmarket you're in, you'll usually do best to err on the side of\nmaking the broadest type of product for it.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nOne year at Startup School David Heinemeier Hansson encouraged\nprogrammers who wanted to start businesses to use a restaurant as\na model.  What he meant, I believe, is that it's fine to start\nsoftware companies constrained in (a) in the same way a restaurant\nis constrained in (b).  I agree.  Most people should not try to\nstart startups.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nThat sort of stepping back is one of the things we focus on at\nY Combinator.  It's common for founders to have discovered something\nintuitively without understanding all its implications.  That's\nprobably true of the biggest discoveries in any field.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f4n\"><font color=\"#000000\">4</font></a>]\nI got it wrong in <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/wealth.html\">\"How to Make Wealth\"</a> when I said that a\nstartup was a small company that takes on a hard technical\nproblem.  That is the most common recipe but not the only one.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f5n\"><font color=\"#000000\">5</font></a>]\nIn principle companies aren't limited by the size of the markets\nthey serve, because they could just expand into new markets.  But\nthere seem to be limits on the ability of big companies to do that.\nWhich means the slowdown that comes from bumping up against the\nlimits of one's markets is ultimately just another way in which\ninternal limits are expressed.<br/><br/>It may be that some of these limits could be overcome by changing\nthe shape of the organization — specifically by sharding it.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f6n\"><font color=\"#000000\">6</font></a>]\nThis is, obviously, only for startups that have already launched\nor can launch during YC.  A startup building a new database will\nprobably not do that.  On the other hand, launching something small\nand then using growth rate as evolutionary pressure is such a\nvaluable technique that any company that could start this way\nprobably should.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f7n\"><font color=\"#000000\">7</font></a>]\nIf the startup is taking the Facebook/Twitter route and building\nsomething they hope will be very popular but from which they don't\nyet have a definite plan to make money, the growth rate has to be\nhigher, even though it's a proxy for revenue growth, because such\ncompanies need huge numbers of users to succeed at all.<br/><br/>Beware too of the edge case where something spreads rapidly but the\nchurn is high as well, so that you have good net growth till you run\nthrough all the potential users, at which point it suddenly stops.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f8n\"><font color=\"#000000\">8</font></a>]\nWithin YC when we say it's ipso facto right to do whatever gets\nyou growth, it's implicit that this excludes trickery like buying\nusers for more than their lifetime value, counting users as active\nwhen they're really not, bleeding out invites at a regularly\nincreasing rate to manufacture a perfect growth curve, etc.  Even\nif you were able to fool investors with such tricks, you'd ultimately\nbe hurting yourself, because you're throwing off your own compass.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f9n\"><font color=\"#000000\">9</font></a>]\nWhich is why it's such a dangerous mistake to believe that\nsuccessful startups are simply the embodiment of some brilliant\ninitial idea.  What you're looking for initially is not so much a\ngreat idea as an idea that could evolve into a great one.   The\ndanger is that promising ideas are not merely blurry versions of\ngreat ones.  They're often different in kind, because the early\nadopters you evolve the idea upon have different needs from the\nrest of the market.  For example, the idea that evolves into Facebook\nisn't merely a subset of Facebook; the idea that evolves into\nFacebook is a site for Harvard undergrads.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f10n\"><font color=\"#000000\">10</font></a>]\nWhat if a company grew at 1.7x a year for a really long time?\nCould it not grow just as big as any successful startup?  In principle\nyes, of course. If our hypothetical company making $1000 a month\ngrew at 1% a week for 19 years, it would grow as big as a company\ngrowing at 5% a week for 4 years.  But while such trajectories may\nbe common in, say, real estate development, you don't see them much\nin the technology business.  In technology, companies that grow\nslowly tend not to grow as big.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f11n\"><font color=\"#000000\">11</font></a>]\nAny expected value calculation varies from person to person\ndepending on their utility function for money.  I.e. the first\nmillion is worth more to most people than subsequent millions.  How\nmuch more depends on the person.  For founders who are younger or\nmore ambitious the utility function is flatter.  Which is probably\npart of the reason the founders of the most successful startups of\nall tend to be on the young side.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f12n\"><font color=\"#000000\">12</font></a>]\nMore precisely, this is the case in the biggest winners, which\nis where all the returns come from.  A startup founder could pull\nthe same trick of enriching himself at the company's expense by\nselling them overpriced components.  But it wouldn't be worth it\nfor the founders of Google to do that.  Only founders of failing\nstartups would even be tempted, but those are writeoffs from the\nVCs' point of view anyway.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f13n\"><font color=\"#000000\">13</font></a>]\nAcquisitions fall into two categories: those where the acquirer\nwants the business, and those where the acquirer just wants the\nemployees.  The latter type is sometimes called an HR acquisition.\nThough nominally acquisitions and sometimes on a scale that has a\nsignificant effect on the expected value calculation for potential\nfounders, HR acquisitions are viewed by acquirers as more akin to\nhiring bonuses.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f14n\"><font color=\"#000000\">14</font></a>]\nI once explained this to some founders who had recently arrived\nfrom Russia.  They found it novel that if you threatened a company\nthey'd pay a premium for you.  \"In Russia they just kill you,\" they\nsaid, and they were only partly joking.  Economically, the fact\nthat established companies can't simply eliminate new competitors\nmay be one of the most valuable aspects of the rule of law.  And\nso to the extent we see incumbents suppressing competitors via\nregulations or patent suits, we should worry, not because it's a\ndeparture from the rule of law per se but from what the rule of law\nis aiming at.<br/><br/>\n<b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Marc Andreessen, Paul Buchheit, Patrick\nCollison, Jessica Livingston, Geoff Ralston, and Harj Taggar for\nreading drafts of this.<br/><br/></p></br></p></font>","date":"2012-09-01T00:00:00Z"}
