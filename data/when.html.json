{"href":"when.html","title":"When To Do What You Love","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">September 2024<br/><br/>There's some debate about whether it's a good idea to \"follow your\npassion.\" In fact the question is impossible to answer with a simple\nyes or no. Sometimes you should and sometimes you shouldn't, but\nthe border between should and shouldn't is very complicated. The\nonly way to give a general answer is to trace it.<br/><br/>When people talk about this question, there's always an implicit\n\"instead of.\" All other things being equal, why wouldn't you work\non what interests you the most? So even raising the question implies\nthat all other things aren't equal, and that you have to choose\nbetween working on what interests you the most and something else,\nlike what pays the best.<br/><br/>And indeed if your main goal is to make money, you can't usually\nafford to work on what interests you the most. People pay you for\ndoing what they want, not what you want. But there's an obvious\nexception: when you both want the same thing. For example, if you\nlove football, and you're good enough at it, you can get paid a lot\nto play it.<br/><br/>Of course the odds are against you in a case like football, because\nso many other people like playing it too. This is not to say you\nshouldn't try though. It depends how much ability you have and how\nhard you're willing to work.<br/><br/>The odds are better when you have strange tastes: when you like\nsomething that pays well and that few other people like. For example,\nit's clear that Bill Gates truly loved running a software company.\nHe didn't just love programming, which a lot of people do. He loved\nwriting software for customers. That is a very strange taste indeed,\nbut if you have it, you can make a lot by indulging it.<br/><br/>There are even some people who have a genuine intellectual interest\nin making money. This is distinct from mere greed. They just can't\nhelp noticing when something is mispriced, and can't help doing\nsomething about it. It's like a puzzle for them.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/when.html#f1n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>In fact there's an edge case here so spectacular that it turns all\nthe preceding advice on its head. If you want to make a really \nhuge\namount of money — hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars\n— it turns out to be very useful to work on what interests you the\nmost. The reason is not the extra motivation you get from doing\nthis, but that the way to make a really large amount of money is\nto start a startup, and working on what interests you is an excellent\nway to discover <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html\"><u>startup ideas</u></a>.<br/><br/>Many if not most of the biggest startups began as projects the\nfounders were doing for fun. Apple, Google, and Facebook all began\nthat way. Why is this pattern so common? Because the best ideas\ntend to be such outliers that you'd overlook them if you were\nconsciously looking for ways to make money. Whereas if you're young\nand good at technology, your unconscious instincts about what would\nbe interesting to work on are very well aligned with what needs to\nbe built.<br/><br/>So there's something like a midwit peak for making money. If you\ndon't need to make much, you can work on whatever you're most\ninterested in; if you want to become moderately rich, you can't\nusually afford to; but if you want to become super rich, and you're\nyoung and good at technology, working on what you're most interested\nin becomes a good idea again.<br/><br/>What if you're not sure what you want? What if you're attracted to\nthe idea of making money and more attracted to some kinds of work\nthan others, but neither attraction predominates? How do you break\nties?<br/><br/>The key here is to understand that such ties are only apparent.\nWhen you have trouble choosing between following your interests and\nmaking money, it's never because you have complete knowledge of\nyourself and of the types of work you're choosing between, and the\noptions are perfectly balanced. When you can't decide which path\nto take, it's almost always due to ignorance. In fact you're usually\nsuffering from three kinds of ignorance simultaneously: you don't\nknow what makes you happy, what the various kinds of work are really\nlike, or how well you could do them. \n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/when.html#f2n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>In a way this ignorance is excusable. It's often hard to predict\nthese things, and no one even tells you that you need to. If you're\nambitious you're told you should go to college, and this is good\nadvice so far as it goes, but that's where it usually ends. No one\ntells you how to figure out what to work on, or how hard this can\nbe.<br/><br/>What do you do in the face of uncertainty? Get more certainty. And\nprobably the best way to do that is to try working on things you're\ninterested in. That will get you more information about how interested\nyou are in them, how good you are at them, and how much scope they\noffer for ambition.<br/><br/>Don't wait. Don't wait till the end of college to figure out what\nto work on. Don't even wait for internships during college. You\ndon't necessarily need a job doing x in order to work on x; often\nyou can just start doing it in some form yourself. And since figuring\nout what to work on is a problem that could take years to solve,\nthe sooner you start, the better.<br/><br/>One useful trick for judging different kinds of work is to look at\nwho your colleagues will be. You'll become like whoever you work\nwith. Do you want to become like these people?<br/><br/>Indeed, the difference in character between different kinds of work\nis magnified by the fact that everyone else is facing the same\ndecisions as you. If you choose a kind of work mainly for how well\nit pays, you'll be surrounded by other people who chose it for the\nsame reason, and that will make it even more soul-sucking than it\nseems from the outside. Whereas if you choose work you're genuinely\ninterested in, you'll be surrounded mostly by other people who are\ngenuinely interested in it, and that will make it extra inspiring.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/when.html#f3n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">3</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The other thing you do in the face of uncertainty is to make choices\nthat are uncertainty-proof. The less sure you are about what to do,\nthe more important it is to choose options that give you more options\nin the future. I call this \"staying upwind.\" If you're unsure whether\nto major in math or economics, for example, choose math; math is\nupwind of economics in the sense that it will be easier to switch\nlater from math to economics than from economics to math.<br/><br/>There's one case, though, where it's easy to say whether you should\nwork on what interests you the most: if you want to do \n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html\"><u>great work</u></a>.\nThis is not a sufficient condition for doing great work, but it is\na necessary one.<br/><br/>There's a lot of selection bias in advice about whether to \"follow\nyour passion,\" and this is the reason. Most such advice comes from\npeople who are famously successful, and if you ask someone who's\nfamously successful how to do what they did, most will tell you\nthat you have to work on what you're most interested in. And this\nis in fact true.<br/><br/>That doesn't mean it's the right advice for everyone. Not everyone\ncan do great work, or wants to. But if you do want to, the complicated\nquestion of whether or not to work on what interests you the most\nbecomes simple. The answer is yes. The root of great work is a sort\nof ambitious curiosity, and you can't manufacture that.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nThese examples show why it's a mistake to assume that economic\ninequality must be evidence of some kind of brokenness or unfairness.\nIt's obvious that different people have different interests, and\nthat some interests yield far more money than others, so how can\nit not be obvious that some people will end up much richer than\nothers? In a world where some people like to write enterprise\nsoftware and others like to make studio pottery, economic inequality\nis the natural outcome.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nDifficulty choosing between interests is a different matter.\nThat's not always due to ignorance. It's often intrinsically\ndifficult. I still have trouble doing it.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nYou can't always take people at their word on this. Since\nit's more prestigious to work on things you're interested in than\nto be driven by money, people who are driven mainly by money will\noften claim to be more interested in their work than they actually\nare. One way to test such claims is by doing the following thought\nexperiment: if their work didn't pay well, would they take day jobs\ndoing something else in order to do it in their spare time? Lots\nof mathematicians and scientists and engineers would. Historically\nlots <i>have</i>. But I don't think as many investment bankers would.<br/><br/>This thought experiment is also useful for distinguishing between\nuniversity departments.<br/><br/><br/><br/><font color=\"888888\"><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Paul Buchheit, \nJessica Livingston,\nRobert Morris, Harj Taggar, and Garry Tan for reading drafts of\nthis.</font><br/><br/></font>","date":"2024-09-01T00:00:00Z"}
