{"href":"pgh.html","title":"How to Make Pittsburgh a Startup Hub","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">April 2016<br/><br/><i>(This is a talk I gave at an event called Opt412 in Pittsburgh.\nMuch of it will apply to other towns.  But not all, because\nas I say in the talk, Pittsburgh has some important advantages over\nmost would-be startup hubs.)</i><br/><br/>What would it take to make Pittsburgh into a startup hub, like\nSilicon Valley?  I understand Pittsburgh pretty well,\nbecause I grew up here, in Monroeville. And I understand Silicon\nValley pretty well because that's where I live now.  Could you get\nthat kind of startup ecosystem going here?<br/><br/>When I agreed to speak here, I didn't think I'd be able to give a\nvery optimistic talk.  I thought I'd be talking about what Pittsburgh\ncould do to become a startup hub, very much in the subjunctive.\nInstead I'm going to talk about what Pittsburgh can do.<br/><br/>What changed my mind was an article I read in, of all places, the <i>New\nYork Times</i> food section.  The title was \"<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/dining/pittsburgh-restaurants.html\"><u>Pittsburgh's Youth-Driven\nFood Boom</u></a>.\"  To most people that might not even sound interesting,\nlet alone something related to startups.  But it was electrifying\nto me to read that title.  I don't think I could pick a more promising\none if I tried.  And when I read the article I got even more excited.\nIt said \"people ages 25 to 29 now make up 7.6 percent of all\nresidents, up from 7 percent about a decade ago.\"  Wow, I thought,\nPittsburgh could be the next Portland.  It could become the cool\nplace all the people in their twenties want to go live.<br/><br/>When I got here a couple days ago, I could feel the difference.  I\nlived here from 1968 to 1984.  I didn't realize it at the time, but\nduring that whole period the city was in free fall. On top of the\nflight to the suburbs that happened everywhere, the steel and nuclear\nbusinesses were both dying. Boy are things different now.  It's not\njust that downtown seems a lot more prosperous. There is an energy\nhere that was not here when I was a kid.<br/><br/>When I was a kid, this was a place young people left. Now it's a\nplace that attracts them.<br/><br/>What does that have to do with startups?  Startups are made\nof people, and the average age of the people in a typical startup\nis right in that 25 to 29 bracket.<br/><br/>I've seen how powerful it is for a city to have those people.  Five\nyears ago they shifted the center of gravity of Silicon Valley from\nthe peninsula to San Francisco.  Google and Facebook are on the\npeninsula, but the next generation of big winners are all in SF.\nThe reason the center of gravity shifted was the talent war, for\nprogrammers especially.  Most 25 to 29 year olds want to live in\nthe city, not down in the boring suburbs.  So whether they like it\nor not, founders know they have to be in the city.  I know multiple\nfounders who would have preferred to live down in the Valley proper,\nbut who made themselves move to SF because they knew otherwise\nthey'd lose the talent war.<br/><br/>So being a magnet for people in their twenties is a very promising\nthing to be.  It's hard to imagine a place becoming a startup hub\nwithout also being that.  When I read that statistic about the\nincreasing percentage of 25 to 29 year olds, I had exactly the same\nfeeling of excitement I get when I see a startup's graphs start to\ncreep upward off the x axis.<br/><br/>Nationally the percentage of 25 to 29 year olds is 6.8%.  That means\nyou're .8% ahead.  The population is 306,000, so we're talking about\na surplus of about 2500 people.  That's the population of a small\ntown, and that's just the surplus. So you have a toehold.  Now you\njust have to expand it.<br/><br/>And though \"youth-driven food boom\" may sound frivolous, it is\nanything but.  Restaurants and cafes are a big part of the personality\nof a city.  Imagine walking down a street in Paris. What are you\nwalking past?  Little restaurants and cafes.  Imagine driving through\nsome depressing random exurb.  What are you driving past?  Starbucks\nand McDonalds and Pizza Hut.   As Gertrude Stein said, there is no\nthere there. You could be anywhere.<br/><br/>These independent restaurants and cafes are not just feeding people.\nThey're making there be a there here.<br/><br/>So here is my first concrete recommendation for turning Pittsburgh\ninto the next Silicon Valley: do everything you can to encourage\nthis youth-driven food boom.  What could the city do?  Treat the\npeople starting these little restaurants and cafes as your users,\nand go ask them what they want.  I can guess at least one thing\nthey might want: a fast permit process.  San Francisco has left you\na huge amount of room to beat them in that department.<br/><br/>I know restaurants aren't the prime mover though.  The prime mover,\nas the Times article said, is cheap housing.  That's a big advantage.\nBut that phrase \"cheap housing\" is a bit misleading.  There are\nplenty of places that are cheaper.  What's special about Pittsburgh\nis not that it's cheap, but that it's a cheap place you'd actually\nwant to live.<br/><br/>Part of that is the buildings themselves. I realized a long time\nago, back when I was a poor twenty-something myself, that the best\ndeals were places that had once been rich, and then became poor.\nIf a place has always been rich, it's nice but too expensive.  If\na place has always been poor, it's cheap but grim.  But if a place\nwas once rich and then got poor, you can find palaces for cheap.\nAnd that's what's bringing people here.  When Pittsburgh was rich,\na hundred years ago, the people who lived here built big solid\nbuildings.  Not always in the best taste, but definitely solid.  So\nhere is another piece of advice for becoming a startup hub: don't\ndestroy the buildings that are bringing people here.  When cities\nare on the way back up, like Pittsburgh is now, developers race to\ntear down the old buildings.  Don't let that happen.  Focus on\nhistoric preservation.  Big real estate development projects are\nnot what's bringing the twenty-somethings here.  They're the opposite\nof the new restaurants and cafes; they subtract personality from\nthe city.<br/><br/>The empirical evidence suggests you cannot be too strict about\nhistoric preservation.  The tougher cities are about it, the better\nthey seem to do.<br/><br/>But the appeal of Pittsburgh is not just the buildings themselves.\nIt's the neighborhoods they're in. Like San Francisco and New York,\nPittsburgh is fortunate in being a pre-car city.  It's not too\nspread out. Because those 25 to 29 year olds do not like driving.\nThey prefer walking, or bicycling, or taking public transport.  If\nyou've been to San Francisco recently you can't help noticing the\nhuge number of bicyclists.  And this is not just a fad that the\ntwenty-somethings have adopted.  In this respect they have discovered\na better way to live.  The beards will go, but not the bikes.  Cities\nwhere you can get around without driving are just better period.\nSo I would suggest you do everything you can to capitalize on this.\nAs with historic preservation, it seems impossible to go too far.<br/><br/>Why not make Pittsburgh the most bicycle and pedestrian friendly\ncity in the country?  See if you can go so far that you make San\nFrancisco seem backward by comparison.  If you do, it's very unlikely\nyou'll regret it.  The city will seem like a paradise to the young\npeople you want to attract.  If they do leave to get jobs elsewhere,\nit will be with regret at leaving behind such a place.  And what's\nthe downside?  Can you imagine a headline \"City ruined by becoming\ntoo bicycle-friendly?\"  It just doesn't happen.<br/><br/>So suppose cool old neighborhoods and cool little restaurants make\nthis the next Portland.  Will that be enough?  It will put you in\na way better position than Portland itself, because Pittsburgh has\nsomething Portland lacks: a first-rate research university.  CMU\nplus little cafes means you have more than hipsters drinking lattes.\nIt means you have hipsters drinking lattes while talking about\ndistributed systems.  Now you're getting really close to San\nFrancisco.<br/><br/>In fact you're better off than San Francisco in one way, because\nCMU is downtown, but Stanford and Berkeley are out in the suburbs.<br/><br/>What can CMU do to help Pittsburgh become a startup hub?  Be an\neven better research university.  CMU is one of the best universities\nin the world, but imagine what things would be like if it were the\nvery best, and everyone knew it.  There are a lot of ambitious\npeople who must go to the best place, wherever it is.  If CMU were it, they would all come here. There would be\nkids in Kazakhstan dreaming of one day living in Pittsburgh.<br/><br/>Being that kind of talent magnet is the most important contribution\nuniversities can make toward making their city a startup hub.  In\nfact it is practically the only contribution they can make.<br/><br/>But wait, shouldn't universities be setting up programs with words\nlike \"innovation\" and \"entrepreneurship\" in their names?  No, they\nshould not.  These kind of things almost always turn out to be\ndisappointments.  They're pursuing the wrong targets.  The way to\nget innovation is not to aim for innovation but to aim for something\nmore specific, like better batteries or better 3D printing.  And\nthe way to learn about entrepreneurship is to do it, which you \n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/before.html\"><u>can't\nin school</u></a>.<br/><br/>I know it may disappoint some administrators to hear that the best\nthing a university can do to encourage startups is to be a great\nuniversity.  It's like telling people who want to lose weight that\nthe way to do it is to eat less.<br/><br/>But if you want to know where startups come from, look at the\nempirical evidence.  Look at the histories of the most successful\nstartups, and you'll find they grow organically out of a couple of\nfounders building something that starts as an interesting side\nproject.  Universities are great at bringing together founders, but\nbeyond that the best thing they can do is get out of the way.  For\nexample, by not claiming ownership of \"intellectual property\" that\nstudents and faculty develop, and by having liberal rules about\ndeferred admission and leaves of absence.<br/><br/>In fact, one of the most effective things a university could do to\nencourage startups is an elaborate form of getting out of the way\ninvented by Harvard.  Harvard used to have exams for the fall\nsemester after Christmas.  At the beginning of January they had\nsomething called \"Reading Period\" when you were supposed to be\nstudying for exams.  And Microsoft and Facebook have something in\ncommon that few people realize: they were both started during Reading\nPeriod.  It's the perfect situation for producing the sort of side\nprojects that turn into startups. The students are all on campus,\nbut they don't have to do anything because they're supposed to be\nstudying for exams.<br/><br/>Harvard may have closed this window, because a few years ago they\nmoved exams before Christmas and shortened reading period from 11\ndays to 7.  But if a university really wanted to help its students\nstart startups, the empirical evidence, weighted by market cap,\nsuggests the best thing they can do is literally nothing.<br/><br/>The culture of Pittsburgh is another of its strengths.  It seems\nlike a city has to be socially liberal to be a startup hub,\nand it's pretty clear why. A city has to tolerate strangeness to\nbe a home for startups, because startups are so strange.  And you\ncan't choose to allow just the forms of strangeness that will turn\ninto big startups, because they're all intermingled.  You have to\ntolerate all strangeness.<br/><br/>That immediately rules out <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/06/us/gay-rights-mississippi-north-carolina.html\"><u>big chunks of the US</u></a>.  I'm optimistic\nit doesn't rule out Pittsburgh.  One of the things I remember from\ngrowing up here, though I didn't realize at the time that there was\nanything unusual about it, is how well people got along.  I'm still\nnot sure why.  Maybe one reason was that everyone felt like an\nimmigrant.  When I was a kid in Monroeville, people didn't call\nthemselves American.  They called themselves Italian or Serbian or\nUkranian.  Just imagine what it must have been like here a hundred\nyears ago, when people were pouring in from twenty different\ncountries.  Tolerance was the only option.<br/><br/>What I remember about the culture of Pittsburgh is that it was\nboth tolerant and pragmatic.  That's how I'd describe the culture\nof Silicon Valley too.  And it's not a coincidence, because Pittsburgh\nwas the Silicon Valley of its time.  This was a city where people\nbuilt new things.  And while the things people build have changed,\nthe spirit you need to do that kind of work is the same.<br/><br/>So although an influx of latte-swilling hipsters may be annoying\nin some ways, I would go out of my way to encourage them.  And more\ngenerally to tolerate strangeness, even unto the degree wacko\nCalifornians do.  For Pittsburgh that is a conservative choice:\nit's a return to the city's roots.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I saved the toughest part for last. There is one more\nthing you need to be a startup hub, and Pittsburgh hasn't got it:\ninvestors.  Silicon Valley has a big investor community because\nit's had 50 years to grow one.  New York has a big investor community\nbecause it's full of people who like money a lot and are quick to\nnotice new ways to get it.  But Pittsburgh has neither of these.\nAnd the cheap housing that draws other people here has no effect\non investors.<br/><br/>If an investor community grows up here, it will happen the same way\nit did in Silicon Valley: slowly and organically.  So I would not\nbet on having a big investor community in the short term.  But\nfortunately there are three trends that make that less necessary\nthan it used to be.  One is that startups are increasingly cheap\nto start, so you just don't need as much outside money as you used\nto.  The second is that thanks to things like Kickstarter, a startup\ncan get to revenue faster.  You can put something on Kickstarter\nfrom anywhere.  The third is programs like Y Combinator.  A startup\nfrom anywhere in the world can go to YC for 3 months, pick up\nfunding, and then return home if they want.<br/><br/>My advice is to make Pittsburgh a great place for startups, and\ngradually more of them will stick.  Some of those will succeed;\nsome of their founders will become investors; and still more startups\nwill stick.<br/><br/>This is not a fast path to becoming a startup hub. But it is at\nleast a path, which is something few other cities have.  And it's\nnot as if you have to make painful sacrifices in the meantime.\nThink about what I've suggested you should do.  Encourage local\nrestaurants, save old buildings, take advantage of density, make\nCMU the best, promote tolerance.  These are the things that make\nPittsburgh good to live in now.  All I'm saying is that you should\ndo even more of them.<br/><br/>And that's an encouraging thought.  If Pittsburgh's path to becoming\na startup hub is to be even more itself, then it has a good chance\nof succeeding.  In fact it probably has the best chance of any city\nits size.  It will take some effort, and a lot of time, but if any\ncity can do it, Pittsburgh can.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Charlie Cheever and Jessica Livingston for reading\ndrafts of this, and to Meg Cheever for organizing Opt412 and inviting\nme to speak.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2016-04-01T00:00:00Z"}
