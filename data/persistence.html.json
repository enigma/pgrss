New ideas often don't work\nat first, but they're not deterred. They keep trying and eventually\nfind something that does.<br/><br/>Mere obstinacy, on the other hand, is a recipe for failure. Obstinate\npeople are so annoying. They won't listen. They beat their heads\nagainst a wall and get nowhere.<br/><br/>But is there any real difference between these two cases? Are\npersistent and obstinate people actually behaving differently? Or\nare they doing the same thing, and we just label them later as\npersistent or obstinate depending on whether they turned out to be\nright or not?<br/><br/>If that's the only difference then there's nothing to be learned\nfrom the distinction. Telling someone to be persistent rather than\nobstinate would just be telling them to be right rather than wrong,\nand they already know that. Whereas if persistence and obstinacy\nare actually different kinds of behavior, it would be worthwhile\nto tease them apart.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/persistence.html#f1n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>I've talked to a lot of determined people, and it seems to me that\nthey're different kinds of behavior. I've often walked away from a\nconversation thinking either \"Wow, that guy is determined\" or \"Damn,\nthat guy is stubborn,\" and I don't think I'm just talking about\nwhether they seemed right or not. That's part of it, but not all\nof it.<br/><br/>There's something annoying about the obstinate that's not simply\ndue to being mistaken. They won't listen. And that's not true of\nall determined people. I can't think of anyone more determined than\nthe Collison brothers, and when you point out a problem to them,\nthey not only listen, but listen with an almost predatory intensity.\nIs there a hole in the bottom of their boat? Probably not, but if\nthere is, they want to know about it.<br/><br/>It's the same with most successful people. They're never <i>more</i>\nengaged than when you disagree with them. Whereas the obstinate\ndon't want to hear you. When you point out problems, their eyes\nglaze over, and their replies sound like ideologues talking about\nmatters of doctrine.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/persistence.html#f2n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The reason the persistent and the obstinate seem similar is that\nthey're both hard to stop. But they're hard to stop in different\nsenses. The persistent are like boats whose engines can't be throttled\nback. The obstinate are like boats whose rudders can't be turned.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/persistence.html#f3n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">3</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>In the degenerate case they're indistinguishable: when there's only\none way to solve a problem, your only choice is whether to give up\nor not, and persistence and obstinacy both say no. This is presumably\nwhy the two are so often conflated in popular culture. It assumes\nsimple problems. But as problems get more complicated, we can see\nthe difference between them. The persistent are much more attached\nto points high in the decision tree than to minor ones lower down,\nwhile the obstinate spray \"don't give up\" indiscriminately over the\nwhole tree.<br/><br/>The persistent are attached to the goal. The obstinate are attached\nto their ideas about how to reach it.<br/><br/>Worse still, that means they'll tend to be attached to their <i>first</i>\nideas about how to solve a problem, even though these are the least\ninformed by the experience of working on it. So the obstinate aren't\nmerely attached to details, but disproportionately likely to be\nattached to wrong ones.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Why are they like this? Why are the obstinate obstinate? One\npossibility is that they're overwhelmed. They're not very capable.\nThey take on a hard problem. They're immediately in over their head.\nSo they grab onto ideas the way someone on the deck of a rolling\nship might grab onto the nearest handhold.<br/><br/>That was my initial theory, but on examination it doesn't hold up.\nIf being obstinate were simply a consequence of being in over one's\nhead, you could make persistent people become obstinate by making\nthem solve harder problems. But that's not what happens. If you\nhanded the Collisons an extremely hard problem to solve, they\nwouldn't become obstinate. If anything they'd become less obstinate.\nThey'd know they had to be open to anything.<br/><br/>Similarly, if obstinacy were caused by the situation, the obstinate\nwould stop being obstinate when solving easier problems. But they\ndon't. And if obstinacy isn't caused by the situation, it must come\nfrom within. It must be a feature of one's personality.<br/><br/>Obstinacy is a reflexive resistance to changing one's ideas. This\nis not identical with stupidity, but they're closely related. A\nreflexive resistance to changing one's ideas becomes a sort of\ninduced stupidity as contrary evidence mounts. And obstinacy is a\nform of not giving up that's easily practiced by the stupid. You\ndon't have to consider complicated tradeoffs; you just dig in your\nheels. It even works, up to a point.<br/><br/>The fact that obstinacy works for simple problems is an important\nclue. Persistence and obstinacy aren't opposites. The relationship\nbetween them is more like the relationship between the two kinds\nof respiration we can do: aerobic respiration, and the anaerobic\nrespiration we inherited from our most distant ancestors. Anaerobic\nrespiration is a more primitive process, but it has its uses. When\nyou leap suddenly away from a threat, that's what you're using.<br/><br/>The optimal amount of obstinacy is not zero. It can be good if your\ninitial reaction to a setback is an unthinking \"I won't give up,\"\nbecause this helps prevent panic. But unthinking only gets you so\nfar. The further someone is toward the obstinate end of the continuum,\nthe less likely they are to succeed in solving hard problems.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/persistence.html#f4n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">4</font></a>]</font><br/><br/><br/><br/>Obstinacy is a simple thing. Animals have it. But persistence turns\nout to have a fairly complicated internal structure.<br/><br/>One thing that distinguishes the persistent is their energy. At the\nrisk of putting too much weight on words, they persist rather than\nmerely resisting. They keep trying things. Which means the persistent\nmust also be imaginative. To keep trying things, you have to keep\nthinking of things to try.<br/><br/>Energy and imagination make a wonderful combination. Each gets the\nbest out of the other. Energy creates demand for the ideas produced\nby imagination, which thus produces more, and imagination gives\nenergy somewhere to go.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/persistence.html#f5n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">5</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Merely having energy and imagination is quite rare. But to solve\nhard problems you need three more qualities: resilience, good\njudgement, and a focus on some kind of goal.<br/><br/>Resilience means not having one's morale destroyed by setbacks.\nSetbacks are inevitable once problems reach a certain size, so if\nyou can't bounce back from them, you can only do good work on a\nsmall scale. But resilience is not the same as obstinacy. Resilience\nmeans setbacks can't change your morale, not that they can't change\nyour mind.<br/><br/>Indeed, persistence often requires that one change one's mind.\nThat's where good judgement comes in. The persistent are quite\nrational. They focus on expected value. It's this, not recklessness,\nthat lets them work on things that are unlikely to succeed.<br/><br/>There is one point at which the persistent are often irrational\nthough: at the very top of the decision tree. When they choose\nbetween two problems of roughly equal expected value, the choice\nusually comes down to personal preference. Indeed, they'll often\nclassify projects into deliberately wide bands of expected value\nin order to ensure that the one they want to work on still qualifies.<br/><br/>Empirically this doesn't seem to be a problem. It's ok to be\nirrational near the top of the decision tree. One reason is that\nwe humans will work harder on a problem we love. But there's another\nmore subtle factor involved as well: our preferences among problems\naren't random. When we love a problem that other people don't, it's\noften because we've unconsciously noticed that it's more important\nthan they realize.<br/><br/>Which leads to our fifth quality: there needs to be some overall\ngoal. If you're like me you began, as a kid, merely with the desire\nto do something great. In theory that should be the most powerful\nmotivator of all, since it includes everything that could possibly\nbe done. But in practice it's not much use, precisely because it\nincludes too much. It doesn't tell you what to do at this moment.<br/><br/>So in practice your energy and imagination and resilience and good\njudgement have to be directed toward some fairly specific goal. Not\ntoo specific, or you might miss a great discovery adjacent to what\nyou're searching for, but not too general, or it won't work to\nmotivate you.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/persistence.html#f6n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">6</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>When you look at the internal structure of persistence, it doesn't\nresemble obstinacy at all. It's so much more complex. Five distinct\nqualities — energy, imagination, resilience, good judgement, and\nfocus on a goal — combine to produce a phenomenon that seems a bit\nlike obstinacy in the sense that it causes you not to give up. But\nthe way you don't give up is completely different. Instead of merely\nresisting change, you're driven toward a goal by energy and resilience,\nthrough paths discovered by imagination and optimized by judgement.\nYou'll give way on any point low down in the decision tree, if its\nexpected value drops sufficiently, but energy and resilience keep\npushing you toward whatever you chose higher up.<br/><br/>Considering what it's made of, it's not surprising that the right\nkind of stubbornness is so much rarer than the wrong kind, or that\nit gets so much better results. Anyone can do obstinacy. Indeed,\nkids and drunks and fools are best at it. Whereas very few people\nhave enough of all five of the qualities that produce the right kind\nof stubbornness, but when they do the results are magical.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nI'm going to use \"persistent\" for the good kind of stubborn\nand \"obstinate\" for the bad kind, but I can't claim I'm simply\nfollowing current usage. Conventional opinion barely distinguishes\nbetween good and bad kinds of stubbornness, and usage is correspondingly\npromiscuous. I could have invented a new word for the good kind,\nbut it seemed better just to stretch \"persistent.\"<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nThere are some domains where one can succeed by being obstinate.\nSome political leaders have been notorious for it. But it won't\nwork in situations where you have to pass external tests. And indeed\nthe political leaders who are famous for being obstinate are famous\nfor getting power, not for using it well.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nThere will be some resistance to turning the rudder of a\npersistent person, because there's some cost to changing direction.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f4n\"><font color=\"#000000\">4</font></a>]\nThe obstinate do sometimes succeed in solving hard problems.\nOne way is through luck: like the stopped clock that's right twice\na day, they seize onto some arbitrary idea, and it turns out to be\nright. Another is when their obstinacy cancels out some other form\nof error. For example, if a leader has overcautious subordinates,\ntheir estimates of the probability of success will always be off\nin the same direction. So if he mindlessly says \"push ahead regardless\"\nin every borderline case, he'll usually turn out to be right.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f5n\"><font color=\"#000000\">5</font></a>]\nIf you stop there, at just energy and imagination, you get\nthe conventional caricature of an artist or poet.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f6n\"><font color=\"#000000\">6</font></a>]\nStart by erring on the small side. If you're inexperienced\nyou'll inevitably err on one side or the other, and if you err on\nthe side of making the goal too broad, you won't get anywhere.\nWhereas if you err on the small side you'll at least be moving\nforward. Then, once you're moving, you expand the goal.<br/><br/><br/><br/><font color=\"888888\"><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, \nJessica Livingston, Jackie McDonough,\nCourtenay Pipkin, Harj Taggar, and Garry Tan for reading drafts of\nthis.</font><br/><br/></font>","date":"2024-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
