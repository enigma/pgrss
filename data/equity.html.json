Should you take it?  You're about to hire your first\nemployee.  How much stock should you give him?<br/><br/>These are some of the hardest questions founders face.  And yet\nboth have the same answer:<br/><br/>1/(1 - n)<br/><br/>Whenever you're trading stock in your company for anything, whether\nit's money or an employee or a deal with another company, the test\nfor whether to do it is the same.  You should give up n% of your\ncompany if what you trade it for improves your average outcome\nenough that the (100 - n)% you have left is worth more than the\nwhole company was before.<br/><br/>For example, if an investor wants to buy half your company, how\nmuch does that investment have to improve your average outcome for\nyou to break even?  Obviously it has to double: if you trade half\nyour company for something that more than doubles the company's\naverage outcome, you're net ahead.  You have half as big a share\nof something worth more than twice as much.<br/><br/>In the general case, if n is the fraction of the company you're\ngiving up, the deal is a good one if it makes the company worth\nmore than 1/(1 - n).<br/><br/>For example, suppose Y Combinator offers to fund you in return for\n7% of your company.  In this case, n is .07 and 1/(1 - n) is 1.075.\nSo you should take the deal if you believe we can improve your\naverage outcome by more than 7.5%.  If we improve your outcome by\n10%, you're net ahead, because the remaining .93 you hold is worth\n.93 x 1.1 = 1.023.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f1n\"><font color=\"#777777\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>One of the things the equity equation shows us is that, financially\nat least, taking money from a top VC firm can be a really good deal.\nGreg Mcadoo from Sequoia recently said at a YC dinner that when\nSequoia invests alone they like to take about 30% of a company.\n1/.7 = 1.43, meaning that deal is worth taking if they can improve\nyour outcome by more than 43%.  For the average startup, that would\nbe an extraordinary bargain.  It would improve the average startup's\nprospects by more than 43% just to be able to <i>say</i> they were funded\nby Sequoia, even if they never actually got the money.<br/><br/>The reason Sequoia is such a good deal is that the percentage of\nthe company they take is artificially low.  They don't even try to\nget market price for their investment; they limit their holdings\nto leave the founders enough stock to feel the company is still\ntheirs.<br/><br/>The catch is that Sequoia gets about 6000 business plans a year and\nfunds about 20 of them, so the odds of getting this great deal are\n1 in 300. The companies that make it through are not average startups.<br/><br/>Of course, there are other factors to consider in a VC deal.  It's\nnever just a straight trade of money for stock.  But if it were,\ntaking money from a top firm would generally be a bargain.<br/><br/>You can use the same formula when giving stock to employees, but\nit works in the other direction.  If i is the average outcome for\nthe company with the addition of some new person, then they're worth\nn such that i = 1/(1 - n).  Which means n = (i - 1)/i.<br/><br/>For example, suppose you're just two founders and you want to hire\nan additional hacker who's so good you feel he'll increase the\naverage outcome of the whole company by 20%.  n = (1.2 - 1)/1.2 =\n.167.  So you'll break even if you trade 16.7% of the company\nfor him.<br/><br/>That doesn't mean 16.7% is the right amount of stock to give him.\nStock is not the only cost of hiring someone: there's usually salary\nand overhead as well.  And if the company merely breaks even on the\ndeal, there's no reason to do it.<br/><br/>I think to translate salary and overhead into stock you should\nmultiply the annual rate by about 1.5.  Most startups grow fast or\ndie; if you die you don't have to pay the guy, and if you grow fast\nyou'll be paying next year's salary out of next year's valuation,\nwhich should be 3x this year's.  If your valuation grows 3x a year,\nthe total cost in stock of a new hire's salary and overhead is 1.5\nyears' cost at the present valuation.  <font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f2n\"><font color=\"#777777\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>How much of an additional margin should the company need as the\n\"activation energy\" for the deal?  Since this is in effect the\ncompany's profit on a hire, the market will determine that: if\nyou're a hot opportunity, you can charge more.<br/><br/>Let's run through an example.  Suppose the company wants to make a\n\"profit\" of 50% on the new hire mentioned above.  So subtract a\nthird from 16.7% and we have 11.1% as his \"retail\" price.  Suppose\nfurther that he's going to cost $60k a year in salary and overhead,\nx 1.5 = $90k total.  If the company's valuation is $2 million, $90k\nis 4.5%.  11.1% - 4.5% = an offer of 6.6%.<br/><br/>Incidentally, notice how important it is for early employees to\ntake little salary.  It comes right out of stock that could otherwise\nbe given to them.<br/><br/>Obviously there is a great deal of play in these numbers.  I'm not\nclaiming that stock grants can now be reduced to a formula.  Ultimately\nyou always have to guess.  But at least know what you're guessing.\nIf you choose a number based on your gut feel, or a table of typical\ngrant sizes supplied by a VC firm, understand what those are estimates\nof.<br/><br/>And more generally, when you make any decision involving equity,\nrun it through 1/(1 - n) to see if it makes sense.  You should\nalways feel richer after trading equity.  If the trade didn't\nincrease the value of your remaining shares enough to put you net\nahead, you wouldn't have (or shouldn't have) done it.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>] This is why we\ncan't believe anyone would think Y Combinator was a bad deal.  Does\nanyone really think we're so useless that in three months we can't\nimprove a startup's prospects by 7.5%?\n<!--\nUsually people who say we're a bad deal, like Seth Levine in <a\nhref=\"http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/technology/2007-07-17-ycombinator_N.htm\">this\narticle</a>, simply don't understand what we do.   If all we did\nwas write checks, YC would be a bad deal.  But in fact the money\nis the least of what we do.  No VC who has seen Demo Day first hand\nhas ever said YC took too much equity.\n--><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>] The obvious choice\nfor your present valuation is the post-money valuation of your last\nfunding round.  This probably undervalues the company, though,\nbecause (a) unless your last round just happened, the company is\npresumably worth more, and (b) the valuation of an early funding\nround usually reflects some other contribution by the investors.<br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Paul Buchheit, \nHutch Fishman, David Hornik, Paul Kedrosky, Jessica Livingston, Gary Sabot, and \nJoshua Schachter for reading drafts of this.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2007-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
