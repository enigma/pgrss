But if you have been, it probably made\nyou wince.<br/><br/>Restricted donations mean donations where the donor limits what can\nbe done with the money. This is common with big donations, perhaps\nthe default. And yet it's usually a bad idea. Usually the way the\ndonor wants the money spent is not the way the nonprofit would have\nchosen. Otherwise there would have been no need to restrict the\ndonation. But who has a better understanding of where money needs\nto be spent, the nonprofit or the donor?<br/><br/>If a nonprofit doesn't understand better than its donors where money\nneeds to be spent, then it's incompetent and you shouldn't be\ndonating to it at all.<br/><br/>Which means a restricted donation is inherently suboptimal. It's\neither a donation to a bad nonprofit, or a donation for the wrong\nthings.<br/><br/>There are a couple exceptions to this principle. One is when the\nnonprofit is an umbrella organization. It's reasonable to make a\nrestricted donation to a university, for example, because a university\nis only nominally a single nonprofit. Another exception is when the\ndonor actually does know as much as the nonprofit about where money\nneeds to be spent. The Gates Foundation, for example, has specific\ngoals and often makes restricted donations to individual nonprofits\nto accomplish them. But unless you're a domain expert yourself or\ndonating to an umbrella organization, your donation would do more\ngood if it were unrestricted.<br/><br/>If restricted donations do less good than unrestricted ones, why\ndo donors so often make them? Partly because doing good isn't donors'\nonly motive. They often have other motives as well â€” to make a mark,\nor to generate good publicity\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/donate.html#f1n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">1</font></a>]</font>,\nor to comply with regulations\nor corporate policies. Many donors may simply never have considered\nthe distinction between restricted and unrestricted donations. They\nmay believe that donating money for some specific purpose is just\nhow donation works. And to be fair, nonprofits don't try very hard\nto discourage such illusions. They can't afford to. People running\nnonprofits are almost always anxious about money. They can't afford\nto talk back to big donors.<br/><br/>You can't expect candor in a relationship so asymmetric. So I'll\ntell you what nonprofits wish they could tell you. If you want to\ndonate to a nonprofit, donate unrestricted. If you trust them to\nspend your money, trust them to decide how.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Note</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nUnfortunately restricted donations tend to generate more\npublicity than unrestricted ones. \"X donates money to build a school\nin Africa\" is not only more interesting than \"X donates money to Y\nnonprofit to spend as Y chooses,\" but also focuses more attention\non X.<br/><br/>\n<b>Thanks</b> to Chase Adam, Ingrid Bassett, Trevor Blackwell, and Edith\nElliot for reading drafts of this.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2021-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
