The latter was till recently something only\na small elite had to think about.  Now we all have to, because\nthe Web has made us all publishers.)</i>-->\nHave you ever seen an old photo of yourself and\nbeen embarrassed at the way you looked?   <i>Did we actually\ndress like that?</i>  We did.  And we had no idea how\nsilly we looked.\nIt's the nature of fashion to be invisible, in the\nsame way the movement of the earth is invisible to all\nof us riding on it.<br/><br/>What scares me is that there are moral fashions too.\nThey're just as arbitrary, and just as invisible to most people.\nBut they're much more dangerous.\nFashion is mistaken for good design; \nmoral fashion is mistaken for good.\nDressing oddly gets you laughed at.  Violating\nmoral fashions can get you fired, ostracized, imprisoned, or\neven killed.<br/><br/>If you could travel back in a time machine, one thing\nwould be true no matter where you went: you'd have to watch\nwhat you said.  \nOpinions we consider harmless could have \ngotten you in big trouble.\nI've already said at least one thing that would have gotten me in big\ntrouble in most of Europe in the seventeenth century,\nand did get Galileo in big trouble when he said\nit 혰 that the earth moves. [1]<br/><br/><!--\nNerds are always getting in \n<a href=\"http://news.com.com/2100-1009-5082649.html\">trouble</a>.  \nThey say improper things\nfor the same reason they dress unfashionably and have good ideas:\nconvention has less hold over them.\n-->\nIt seems to be a constant throughout history: In every\nperiod, people believed things that were just ridiculous,\nand believed them so strongly that you would have gotten in\nterrible trouble for saying otherwise.<br/><br/>Is our time any different?\nTo anyone who has read any amount of history, the answer is\nalmost certainly no.   It would be a remarkable coincidence if ours\nwere the first era to get everything just right.<br/><br/>It's tantalizing to think we believe\nthings that people in the future will find ridiculous.\nWhat <i>would</i> someone coming back to visit us in a time machine\nhave to be careful not to say?\nThat's what I want to study here.\nBut\nI want to do more than just shock everyone with\nthe heresy du jour.  I want to find general\nrecipes for discovering what you can't say, in any era.<br/><br/><b>The Conformist Test</b><br/><br/>Let's start with a test:  \nDo you have any opinions that you would be reluctant to express\nin front of a group of your peers?<br/><br/>If the answer is no,\nyou might want to stop and think about that.  If everything\nyou believe is something you're supposed to believe, could\nthat possibly be a coincidence?  Odds are it isn't.  Odds are\nyou just think what<!--17 ever--> you're told.<br/><br/>The other alternative would be that you independently considered\nevery question and came up with the exact same answers that\nare now considered acceptable.  That seems unlikely, because\nyou'd also have to make the same mistakes.  Mapmakers\ndeliberately put slight mistakes in their maps so they can\ntell when someone copies them.  If another map has the same\nmistake, that's very convincing evidence.<br/><br/>Like every other era in history, our moral map almost certainly\ncontains a few mistakes.  And anyone who makes the same mistakes\nprobably didn't do it by accident.  It would be\nlike someone claiming they had independently decided in\n1972 that bell-bottom jeans were a good idea.<br/><br/>If you believe everything you're supposed to now, how can\nyou be sure you wouldn't also have believed everything you\nwere supposed to if you had grown up among the plantation\nowners of the pre-Civil War South, or in Germany in the 1930s 혰 or\namong the Mongols in 1200, for that matter?  Odds are you\nwould have.<br/><br/>Back in the era of terms like \"well-adjusted,\" the idea\nseemed to be that there was something wrong with\nyou if you thought things you didn't dare say out loud.\nThis seems backward.  Almost certainly, there\nis something wrong with you if you <i>don't</i> think things\nyou don't dare say out loud.<br/><br/><b>Trouble</b><br/><br/>What can't we say?  One way to find these ideas is simply to look\nat things people do say, and get in trouble for.  [2]<br/><br/>Of course, we're not just looking for things we can't say.   \nWe're looking for things we can't say that are true, or at least\nhave enough chance of being true that the question\nshould remain open.  But many of the\nthings people get in trouble for saying probably\ndo make it over this second, lower threshold.  No one\ngets in trouble for saying\nthat 2 + 2 is 5, or that people in Pittsburgh are ten feet tall.\nSuch obviously false statements might be treated as jokes, or\nat worst as evidence of insanity, but they are not likely to\nmake anyone mad.  The statements that make people mad are\nthe ones they worry might be believed.\nI suspect the statements that make people maddest\nare those they worry might be true.<br/><br/>If Galileo had said that people in Padua were ten feet tall,\nhe would have been regarded as a harmless eccentric.  Saying   \nthe earth orbited the sun was another matter.  The church knew\nthis would set people thinking.<br/><br/>Certainly, as we look back on the past, this rule of thumb works\nwell.  A lot of the statements people got in trouble for seem\nharmless now.  So it's likely that visitors from the\nfuture would agree with at least some of the statements that\nget people in trouble today.  Do we have no Galileos?  Not\nlikely.<br/><br/>To find them,\nkeep track of opinions that get\npeople in trouble, and start asking, could this be true?\nOk, it may be heretical (or whatever modern equivalent), but\nmight it also be true?<br/><br/><b>Heresy</b><br/><br/>This won't get us all the answers, though.  What if no one\nhappens to have gotten in trouble for a particular idea yet?\nWhat if some idea would be so radioactively controversial that\nno one would dare express it in public?   How can we find these too?<br/><br/>Another approach is to follow that word, heresy.  In every period\nof history, there seem to have been labels that got applied to \nstatements to shoot them down before anyone had a chance to ask\nif they were true or not.  \"Blasphemy\", \"sacrilege\", and \"heresy\"\nwere such\nlabels for a good part of western history, as in more recent times\n\"indecent\", \"improper\", and \"unamerican\" have been.   By now these\nlabels have lost their sting.  They always do.\nBy now they're mostly used ironically.\nBut in their time,\nthey had real force.<br/><br/>The word \"defeatist\", for example, has no particular political\nconnotations now.\nBut in Germany in 1917 it was a weapon, used by Ludendorff in\na purge of those who favored a negotiated peace.\nAt the start of World War II it was used\nextensively by Churchill and his supporters to silence their\nopponents.\nIn 1940, any argument against Churchill's aggressive policy was \"defeatist\".\nWas it right or wrong?  Ideally, no one got far enough to ask\nthat.<br/><br/><!--\n(I have this commented out while I investigate whether the current \n fashion for the word \"divisive\" really began with the Republicans.\n So far it seems not.  Oops; sorry.<br /><br />We have such labels today, of course, quite a lot of them.  \nMany come from the left, including\nthe startlingly general \"inappropriate\", but the most recent comes\nfrom the right: \"divisive\", which the current\nadministration uses to silence opponents on almost any topic.\n-->\nWe have such labels today, of course, quite a lot of them,\nfrom the all-purpose \"inappropriate\" to the dreaded \"divisive.\"\nIn any period, it should be easy to figure out what such labels are,\nsimply by looking at what people call ideas they disagree\nwith besides untrue.  When a politician says his opponent is\nmistaken, that's a straightforward criticism, but when he\nattacks a statement as \"divisive\" or \"racially insensitive\"\ninstead of arguing that it's false, we should start paying\nattention.<br/><br/>So another way to figure out which of our taboos future generations\nwill laugh at is to start with the\nlabels.  Take a label 혰 \"sexist\", for example 혰 and try to think\nof some ideas that would be called that.  Then for each ask, might\nthis be true?<br/><br/>Just start listing ideas at random?  Yes, because they\nwon't really be random.  The ideas that come to mind first\nwill be the most plausible ones.  They'll be things you've already  \nnoticed but didn't let yourself think.<br/><br/>In 1989 some clever researchers tracked\nthe eye movements of radiologists as they scanned chest images for\nsigns of lung cancer. [3]  They found that even when the radiologists\nmissed a cancerous lesion, their eyes had usually paused at the site of it.\nPart of their brain knew there was something there; it just\ndidn't percolate all the way up into conscious knowledge. \nI think many interesting heretical thoughts are already mostly   \nformed in our minds.  If we turn off our self-censorship\ntemporarily, those will be the first to emerge.<br/><br/><b>Time and Space</b><br/><br/>If we could look into the future it would be obvious which\nof our taboos they'd laugh at.\nWe can't do that, but we can do something almost as good: we can\nlook into the past.  Another way to figure out what we're\ngetting wrong is to look at what used to be acceptable\nand is now unthinkable.<br/><br/>Changes between the past and the present sometimes do represent\nprogress.  In a field like physics,\nif we disagree with past generations it's because we're\nright and they're wrong.  But this becomes rapidly less true as   \nyou move away from the certainty of the hard sciences.  By the time\nyou get to social questions, many changes are just fashion.\nThe age of consent fluctuates like hemlines.<br/><br/>We may imagine that we are a great deal smarter and more virtuous than\npast generations, but the more history you read, the less likely\nthis seems.  People in past times were much like us.  Not heroes,\nnot barbarians.  Whatever their ideas were, they were ideas\nreasonable people could believe.<br/><br/>So here is another source of interesting heresies.  Diff present\nideas against those of various past cultures, and see what you   \nget. [4]\nSome will be\nshocking by present standards.  Ok, fine; but which might also be true?<br/><br/>You don't have to look into the past to find big differences.   \nIn our own time, different societies have wildly varying ideas\nof what's ok and what isn't.\nSo you can try diffing other cultures' ideas against ours as well.\n(The best way to do that is to visit them.)\n<!--17 You might find contradictory taboos.  In one\nculture it might seem shocking to think x, while in another\nit was shocking not to.  But \nI think usually the shock is on one side.  In one\nculture x is ok, and in another it's considered shocking.  My\nhypothesis is that the side\nthat's shocked is most likely to be the mistaken one.\nI suspect the only taboos \n that we can be confident are more than taboos\nare the ones that are universal, or nearly so.  Murder for example.\nBut a-->\nAny idea that's considered harmless in a significant\npercentage of times and places, and yet is taboo in ours,\nis a <!--17 good--> candidate for something we're mistaken\nabout.<br/><br/>For example, at the high water mark of political correctness\nin the early 1990s, Harvard distributed to its\nfaculty and staff a brochure saying, among other things, that it\nwas inappropriate to compliment a colleague or student's\nclothes.  No more \"nice shirt.\"\nI think this principle is rare among the world's cultures, past or present.\nThere are probably more where it's considered especially\npolite to compliment someone's clothing than where it's considered\nimproper.\n<!--17 So o-->\nOdds are this is, in a mild form, an example of one of\nthe taboos a visitor from the future would\nhave to be careful to avoid if he happened to set his time machine for\nCambridge, Massachusetts, 1992. [5]<br/><br/><b>Prigs</b><br/><br/>Of course, if they have time machines in the future they'll\nprobably have a separate reference manual just for Cambridge.\nThis has always been a fussy place, a town of i dotters and\nt crossers, where you're liable to get both your grammar and   \nyour ideas corrected in the same conversation.   And that\nsuggests another way to find taboos.  Look for prigs,\nand see what's inside their heads.<br/><br/>Kids' heads are repositories of all our taboos.\nIt seems fitting to us that kids' ideas should be bright and clean.\nThe picture we give them of the world is \nnot merely simplified, to suit their developing minds, \nbut sanitized as well, to suit our\nideas of what kids ought to think. [6]<br/><br/>You can see this on a small scale in the matter of\ndirty words.  A lot of my friends are starting to have children\nnow, and they're all trying \nnot to use words like\n\"fuck\" and \"shit\" within baby's hearing, lest baby start using \nthese words too.\nBut these\nwords are part of the language, and adults use them all the\ntime.  So parents are giving their kids an inaccurate idea of \nthe language by not using\nthem.  Why do they do this?  Because they don't think it's\nfitting that kids should use the whole language.  We like\nchildren to seem innocent. [7]<br/><br/>Most adults, likewise, deliberately give kids a misleading\nview of the world.\nOne of the most obvious\nexamples is Santa Claus.  We think it's cute for little kids to\nbelieve in Santa Claus.  I myself think it's cute for little\nkids to believe in Santa Claus.  But one wonders, do we tell\nthem this stuff for their sake, or for ours?<br/><br/>I'm not arguing for or against this idea here.  It is probably\ninevitable that parents should want to dress up their kids'\nminds in cute little baby outfits.  I'll probably do it myself.\nThe important thing for our purposes is that, as a result,\na well brought-up teenage kid's brain is a more\nor less complete collection of all our taboos 혰 and in mint\ncondition, because they're untainted by experience.  \nWhatever we think that will later turn out to be ridiculous, \nit's almost certainly inside that head.<br/><br/>How do we get at these ideas?  By the following thought experiment.\nImagine a kind of latter-day Conrad character\nwho has worked for a time as a mercenary in Africa, for a time\nas a doctor in Nepal, for a time as the manager of a\nnightclub in Miami.  The specifics don't matter 혰 just\nsomeone who has\nseen a lot.  Now imagine comparing what's inside this guy's head\nwith what's inside the head\nof a well-behaved sixteen year old girl from\nthe suburbs.  What does he think that\nwould shock her?\nHe knows the world; she knows, or at least embodies, present\ntaboos.  Subtract one from the other, and the result is what\nwe can't say.\n<!-- bowles quote about dentist's son from long island--><br/><br/><b>Mechanism</b><br/><br/>I can think of one more way to figure out what we can't\nsay: to look at how taboos are created.   How do moral\nfashions arise, and why are they adopted?\nIf we can understand this mechanism, we\nmay be able to see it at work in our own time.<br/><br/>Moral fashions don't seem to be created the way ordinary\nfashions are.  Ordinary fashions seem to arise by accident when\neveryone imitates the whim of some influential person.\nThe fashion for broad-toed shoes in\nlate fifteenth century Europe began because Charles VIII of\nFrance had six toes on one foot.  The fashion for the\nname Gary began when the actor Frank Cooper adopted the name\nof a tough mill town in Indiana.  Moral fashions more often\nseem to be created deliberately.  When there's something we\ncan't say, it's often because some group doesn't want us to.<br/><br/>The prohibition will be strongest when the group is nervous. \nThe irony of Galileo's situation was that he got in trouble\nfor repeating Copernicus's ideas.  Copernicus himself didn't.\nIn fact, Copernicus was a canon of a cathedral, and dedicated his\nbook to the pope.  But by Galileo's time the church was in\nthe throes of the Counter-Reformation and was much more\nworried about unorthodox ideas.<br/><br/>To launch a taboo, a group has to be poised halfway between\nweakness and power.  A confident group doesn't need taboos\nto protect it.  It's not considered improper to\nmake disparaging remarks about Americans, or the English.\nAnd yet a group has to be powerful enough to enforce a\ntaboo.  Coprophiles, as of this writing, don't seem to be\nnumerous or energetic enough to have had their\ninterests promoted to a lifestyle.<br/><br/>I suspect the biggest source of moral taboos will turn out to\nbe power struggles in which one side only barely has\nthe upper hand.  That's where you'll find a group\npowerful enough to enforce taboos, but weak enough to need them.<br/><br/>Most struggles, whatever they're really about, will be cast\nas struggles between competing ideas.\nThe English Reformation was at bottom a struggle for wealth and power,\nbut it ended up being\ncast as a struggle to preserve the souls\nof Englishmen from the corrupting influence of Rome.\nIt's easier to get people to fight for an idea.\nAnd whichever side wins, their\nideas will also be considered to have triumphed, as if God\nwanted to signal his agreement by selecting that side as the victor.<br/><br/>We often like to think of World War II as a triumph\nof freedom over totalitarianism.  We conveniently forget that\nthe Soviet Union was also one of the winners.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that struggles are never about ideas,\njust that they will always be made to seem to be about\nideas, whether they are or not.   And just as there is nothing\nso unfashionable as the last, discarded fashion, there is\nnothing so wrong as the principles of the most recently\ndefeated opponent.\n<!-- The ideas of the losers in the last war will always trade\nat a discount. -->\nRepresentational art is only now\nrecovering from the approval of both Hitler and Stalin. [8]<br/><br/>Although moral fashions tend to arise from different sources\nthan fashions in clothing, the mechanism of their adoption seems\nmuch the same.  The early adopters will be driven by ambition:\nself-consciously cool people who want to distinguish themselves\nfrom the common herd.  As the fashion becomes established they'll\nbe joined by a second, much larger group, driven by fear. [9] This\nsecond group adopt the fashion not because they want to stand\nout but because they are afraid of standing out.<br/><br/>So if you want to figure out what we can't say, look at the\nmachinery of fashion and try to predict what it would make\nunsayable.  What groups are powerful but nervous, and what\nideas would they like to suppress?  What ideas were tarnished by\nassociation when they ended up on the losing side of a recent\nstruggle?  If a self-consciously cool person wanted to differentiate\nhimself from preceding fashions (e.g. from his parents), \nwhich of their ideas would he tend to reject?\nWhat are conventional-minded people afraid of saying?<br/><br/>This technique won't find us all the things we can't say.\nI can think of some that aren't the result of\nany recent struggle. Many of our taboos are rooted\ndeep in the past.  But this approach, combined with the\npreceding four, will turn up a good number of unthinkable\nideas.<br/><br/><b>Why</b><br/><br/>Some would ask, why would one want to do this?  Why deliberately\ngo poking around among nasty, disreputable ideas?  Why look \nunder rocks?<br/><br/>I do it, first of all, for the same reason I did look under\nrocks as a kid: plain curiosity.  And I'm especially curious about\nanything that's forbidden.  Let me see and decide for myself.<br/><br/>Second, I do it because I don't like the idea of being mistaken.\nIf, like other eras, we believe things that will later seem ridiculous,\nI want to know what they are so that I, at least, can avoid\nbelieving them.<br/><br/>Third, I do it because it's good for the brain.  To do good work\nyou need a brain that can go anywhere.  And you especially need a\nbrain that's in the habit of going where it's not supposed to.<br/><br/>Great work tends to grow out of ideas\nthat others have overlooked, and no idea is so overlooked as one that's\nunthinkable.\nNatural selection, for example.\nIt's so simple.  Why didn't anyone think of it before?  Well,\nthat is all too obvious.  Darwin himself was careful to tiptoe\naround the implications of his theory.  He wanted to spend his\ntime thinking about biology, not arguing with people who accused\nhim of being an atheist.<br/><br/>In the sciences, especially, it's a great advantage to be able to\nquestion assumptions.\nThe m.o. of scientists, or at least of the\ngood ones, is precisely that: look for places where\nconventional wisdom is broken, and then try to pry apart the\ncracks and see what's underneath.  That's where new theories come\nfrom.<br/><br/>A good scientist, in other words, does not merely ignore\nconventional wisdom, but makes a special effort to break it.\nScientists go looking for trouble.\nThis should be the m.o. of any scholar, but \nscientists seem much more willing to look under rocks. [10]<br/><br/>Why?  It could\nbe that the scientists are simply smarter; most physicists could,\nif necessary, make it through a PhD program in French literature,\nbut few professors of French literature could make it through\na PhD program in physics.  Or it could be because it's clearer\nin the sciences whether theories are true or false, and this\nmakes scientists bolder.  (Or it could be that, because it's\nclearer in the sciences whether theories are true or false, you\nhave to be smart to get jobs as a scientist, rather than just a\ngood politician.)<br/><br/>Whatever the reason, there seems a clear correlation between\nintelligence and willingness to consider shocking ideas.\nThis isn't just because smart people actively work to find holes in\nconventional thinking.  I think conventions also have\nless hold over them to start with.\nYou can see that in the\nway they dress.<br/><br/>It's not only in the sciences that heresy pays off.\nIn any competitive field, you can\n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/avg.html\">win big</a> by seeing things that others daren't.  \nAnd in every\nfield there are probably heresies few dare utter.  Within\nthe US car industry there is a lot of hand-wringing now\nabout declining market share.\nYet the cause is so obvious that any observant outsider could\nexplain it in a second: they make bad cars.  And they have for\nso long that by now the US car brands are antibrands 혰 something\nyou'd buy a car despite, not because of.  Cadillac stopped\nbeing the Cadillac of cars in about 1970.  And yet I suspect\nno one dares say this. [11]  Otherwise these companies would have\ntried to fix the problem.<br/><br/>Training yourself to think unthinkable thoughts has advantages\nbeyond the thoughts themselves.  It's like stretching.\nWhen you stretch before running, you put your body into positions\nmuch more extreme\nthan any it will assume during the run.\nIf you can think things\nso outside the box that they'd make people's hair stand on end,\nyou'll have no trouble with the small trips outside the box that\npeople call innovative.<br/><br/><b><i>Pensieri Stretti</i></b><br/><br/>When you find something you can't say, what do you do with it?\nMy advice is, don't say it.   Or at least, pick your battles.<br/><br/>Suppose in the future there is a movement to ban\nthe color yellow. Proposals to paint anything yellow are\ndenounced as \"yellowist\", as is anyone suspected of liking the  \ncolor.  People who like orange are tolerated but viewed with\nsuspicion.  Suppose you realize there is nothing\nwrong with yellow.  If you go around saying this, you'll be\ndenounced as a yellowist too, and you'll find yourself having a   \nlot of arguments with anti-yellowists.\nIf your aim in life is to rehabilitate the color yellow, that may\nbe what you want.\nBut if you're mostly interested in\nother questions, being labelled as a yellowist will just be\na distraction.  Argue with idiots, and you become an idiot.<br/><br/>The most important thing is to be able to think what you\nwant, not to say what you want.  And if you feel you have to\nsay everything you think, it may inhibit you from thinking  \nimproper thoughts.  I think it's better to follow the opposite\npolicy.  Draw a sharp line between your thoughts and your\nspeech.  Inside your head, anything is allowed.\nWithin my head I make a point of encouraging the most outrageous\nthoughts I can imagine. \nBut, as in\na secret society, nothing that happens within the building\nshould be told to outsiders.  The first rule of Fight\nClub is, you do not talk about Fight Club.<br/><br/>When Milton was going to visit Italy in the 1630s,\nSir Henry Wootton, who had been ambassador to Venice, told him\nhis motto should be\n<i>\"i pensieri stretti &amp; il viso sciolto.\"</i>  Closed thoughts\nand an open face.  Smile at everyone, and don't tell them\nwhat you're thinking.   This was wise advice.\nMilton was an argumentative fellow, and the Inquisition\nwas a bit restive at that time.  But I think the difference \nbetween Milton's situation and ours is only a matter of\ndegree.\nEvery era has its heresies, and if you don't get imprisoned for them you\nwill at least get in enough trouble that it becomes a complete\ndistraction.<br/><br/>I admit it seems cowardly to keep quiet.\nWhen I read about the harassment to which\nthe Scientologists subject their critics [12], or that pro-Israel groups\nare \"compiling dossiers\" on those who speak out against Israeli\nhuman rights abuses [13], or about people being sued for\nviolating the DMCA [14], part of me wants\nto say, \"All right, you bastards, bring it on.\"\nThe problem is, there are so many things you can't say.\nIf you said them all you'd \nhave no time left for your real work.\nYou'd have to turn into Noam Chomsky.  [15]<br/><br/>The trouble with keeping your thoughts secret, though,\nis that you lose the advantages of discussion.  Talking\nabout an idea leads to more ideas.\nSo the optimal plan, if you can manage it,\nis to have a few trusted\nfriends you can speak openly to.  This is not just a\nway to develop ideas; it's also a good\nrule of thumb for choosing friends.  The people\nyou can say heretical things to without getting jumped on\nare also the most interesting to know.<br/><br/><b><i>Viso Sciolto?</i></b><br/><br/>I don't think we need\nthe <i>viso sciolto</i> so much as the <i>pensieri stretti.</i>\nPerhaps the best policy is to make it plain that you don't\nagree with whatever zealotry is current in your time, but\nnot to be too specific about what you disagree with.  Zealots\nwill try to draw you out, but you don't have to answer them.\nIf they try to force you to treat a question on their\nterms by asking \"are you with us or against us?\" you can\nalways just answer \"neither\".<br/><br/>Better still, answer \"I haven't decided.\"\nThat's what Larry Summers\ndid when a group tried to put\nhim in this position.  Explaining himself later, he said\n\"I don't do litmus tests.\" [16]\nA lot of the\nquestions people get hot about are actually quite complicated.\nThere is no prize for getting the answer quickly.<br/><br/>If the anti-yellowists seem to be getting out of hand and\nyou want to fight back, there are ways\nto do it without getting yourself accused of being a\nyellowist.  Like skirmishers in\nan ancient army, you want to avoid directly engaging the\nmain body of the enemy's troops.  Better to harass them\nwith arrows from a distance.<br/><br/>One way to do this is to ratchet the debate up one level of\nabstraction.\nIf you argue against censorship in general, you can avoid being\naccused of whatever heresy is contained\nin the book or film that someone is trying to censor.\nYou can attack labels with meta-labels: labels that refer\nto the use of labels to prevent discussion.\nThe spread of the term \"political correctness\" meant the beginning of\nthe end of political correctness, because it enabled one to\nattack the phenomenon as a whole without being accused of any\nof the specific heresies it sought to suppress.<br/><br/>Another way to counterattack is with metaphor.  Arthur Miller\nundermined the House Un-American Activities Committee\nby writing a play, \"The Crucible,\" about the Salem witch trials.\nHe never referred directly to the committee and so gave them\nno way to reply.\nWhat could HUAC do, defend the Salem witch trials?  And yet\nMiller's metaphor stuck so well that to this day the activities\nof the committee are often described as a \"witch-hunt.\"<br/><br/>Best of all, probably, is humor.  Zealots, whatever their   \ncause, invariably lack a sense of humor.\nThey can't reply in kind to jokes.\nThey're as unhappy on the territory of\nhumor as a mounted knight on a skating rink.\nVictorian prudishness, for example, seems to have been defeated\nmainly by treating it as a joke.  Likewise its reincarnation as\npolitical correctness.\n\"I am glad that I\nmanaged to write 'The Crucible,'\" Arthur Miller wrote,\n\"but looking back I have often wished I'd\nhad the temperament to do an absurd comedy, which is what the\nsituation deserved.\" [17]<br/><br/><b>ABQ</b><br/><br/>A Dutch friend says\nI should use Holland as an example of a tolerant society.\nIt's true they have a long tradition of\ncomparative open-mindedness.  For centuries the low countries were the place\nto go to say things you couldn't say anywhere else,\nand this helped to make the region a center of scholarship and industry\n(which have been closely tied for longer than most people realize).\nDescartes, though claimed by the French, did much of his thinking in\nHolland.<br/><br/>And yet, I wonder.  The Dutch seem to live their lives up to their\nnecks in rules and regulations.  There's so much you can't do there;\nis there really nothing\nyou can't say?<br/><br/>Certainly the fact that they value open-mindedness is no guarantee.\nWho thinks they're not open-minded?  Our hypothetical prim miss from\nthe suburbs thinks she's open-minded.  Hasn't she been\ntaught to be?  Ask anyone, and they'll say the same thing: they're\npretty open-minded, though they draw the line at things that are really\nwrong.  (Some tribes\nmay avoid \"wrong\" as\njudgemental, and may instead use a more neutral sounding euphemism\nlike \"negative\" or \"destructive\".)<br/><br/>When people are bad at math, they know it, because they get the\nwrong answers on tests.  But when people are bad at open-mindedness\nthey don't know it.  In fact they tend to think the opposite.\nRemember, it's the nature of fashion to be invisible.  It wouldn't\nwork otherwise.  Fashion doesn't\nseem like fashion to someone in the grip of it.  It just seems like\nthe right thing to do.  It's only by looking from a distance that\nwe see oscillations in people's idea of the right thing to do, and\ncan identify them as fashions.<br/><br/>Time gives us such distance for free.  Indeed, the arrival of new\nfashions makes old fashions easy to see, because they\nseem so ridiculous by contrast.  From one end of a pendulum's\nswing, the other end seems especially far away.<br/><br/>To see fashion in your own time, though, requires a conscious effort.\nWithout time to give you distance, you have to create distance yourself.\nInstead of being part of the mob, stand\nas far away from it as you can and watch what it's\ndoing.  And pay especially close attention whenever an idea is being\nsuppressed.  Web filters for children and employees often ban\nsites containing pornography, violence, and hate speech.  What\ncounts as pornography and violence?  And what, exactly, is\n\"hate speech?\" This sounds like a phrase out of <i>1984.</i><br/><br/>Labels like that are probably the biggest external clue.\nIf a statement is false,\nthat's the worst thing you can say about it.  You don't\nneed to say that it's heretical.  And if it isn't false, it\nshouldn't be suppressed.  So when you see statements being\nattacked as x-ist or y-ic (substitute your current values of\nx and y), whether in 1630 or 2030, that's a sure sign that\nsomething is wrong.  When you hear such labels being used,\nask why.<br/><br/>Especially if you hear yourself using them.  It's not just\nthe mob you need to learn to watch from a distance.  You need to be\nable to watch your own thoughts from a distance.  That's not\na radical idea, by the way; it's the main difference between\nchildren and adults.  When a child gets angry because he's\ntired, he doesn't know what's happening.  An adult can\ndistance himself enough from the\nsituation to say \"never mind, I'm just tired.\"  I don't\nsee why one couldn't, by a similar process, learn to\nrecognize and discount the effects of moral fashions.<br/><br/>You have to take that extra step if you want to think clearly.\nBut it's harder, because now you're working against social customs \ninstead of with them.  Everyone encourages you to grow up to the \npoint where you can discount your own bad moods.  Few encourage   \nyou to continue to the point where you can discount society's bad\nmoods.<br/><br/>How can you see the wave, when you're the water?  Always be\nquestioning.  That's the only defence.  What can't you say?  And why?<br/><br/><br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/saynotes.html\"><u><b>Notes</b></u></a><br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Sarah Harlin, Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston,\nRobert Morris, Eric Raymond and Bob van der Zwaan for reading drafts of this\nessay, and to Lisa Randall, Jackie McDonough, Ryan Stanley and Joel Rainey \nfor conversations about heresy.\nNeedless to say they bear no blame for opinions\nexpressed in it, and especially for opinions <i>not</i>\nexpressed in it.<br/><br/><br clear=\"all\"/></font>","date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
