{"href":"vb.html","title":"Life is Short","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">January 2016<br/><br/>Life is short, as everyone knows. When I was a kid I used to wonder\nabout this. Is life actually short, or are we really complaining\nabout its finiteness?  Would we be just as likely to feel life was\nshort if we lived 10 times as long?<br/><br/>Since there didn't seem any way to answer this question, I stopped\nwondering about it.  Then I had kids.  That gave me a way to answer\nthe question, and the answer is that life actually is short.<br/><br/>Having kids showed me how to convert a continuous quantity, time,\ninto discrete quantities. You only get 52 weekends with your 2 year\nold.  If Christmas-as-magic lasts from say ages 3 to 10, you only\nget to watch your child experience it 8 times.  And while it's\nimpossible to say what is a lot or a little of a continuous quantity\nlike time, 8 is not a lot of something.  If you had a handful of 8\npeanuts, or a shelf of 8 books to choose from, the quantity would\ndefinitely seem limited, no matter what your lifespan was.<br/><br/>Ok, so life actually is short.  Does it make any difference to know\nthat?<br/><br/>It has for me.  It means arguments of the form \"Life is too short\nfor x\" have great force.  It's not just a figure of speech to say\nthat life is too short for something.  It's not just a synonym for\nannoying.  If you find yourself thinking that life is too short for\nsomething, you should try to eliminate it if you can.<br/><br/>When I ask myself what I've found life is too short for, the word\nthat pops into my head is \"bullshit.\" I realize that answer is\nsomewhat tautological.  It's almost the definition of bullshit that\nit's the stuff that life is too short for.  And yet bullshit does\nhave a distinctive character.  There's something fake about it.\nIt's the junk food of experience.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f1n\"><font color=\"#999999\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>If you ask yourself what you spend your time on that's bullshit,\nyou probably already know the answer.  Unnecessary meetings, pointless\ndisputes, bureaucracy, posturing, dealing with other people's\nmistakes, traffic jams, addictive but unrewarding pastimes.<br/><br/>There are two ways this kind of thing gets into your life: it's\neither forced on you, or it tricks you.  To some extent you have to\nput up with the bullshit forced on you by circumstances.  You need\nto make money, and making money consists mostly of errands.  Indeed,\nthe law of supply and demand ensures that: the more rewarding some\nkind of work is, the cheaper people will do it.  It may be that\nless bullshit is forced on you than you think, though.  There has\nalways been a stream of people who opt out of the default grind and\ngo live somewhere where opportunities are fewer in the conventional\nsense, but life feels more authentic.  This could become more common.<br/><br/>You can do it on a smaller scale without moving.  The amount of\ntime you have to spend on bullshit varies between employers.  Most\nlarge organizations (and many small ones) are steeped in it.  But\nif you consciously prioritize bullshit avoidance over other factors\nlike money and prestige, you can probably find employers that will\nwaste less of your time.<br/><br/>If you're a freelancer or a small company, you can do this at the\nlevel of individual customers.  If you fire or avoid toxic customers,\nyou can decrease the amount of bullshit in your life by more than\nyou decrease your income.<br/><br/>But while some amount of bullshit is inevitably forced on you, the\nbullshit that sneaks into your life by tricking you is no one's\nfault but your own.  And yet the bullshit you choose may be harder\nto eliminate than the bullshit that's forced on you.  Things that\nlure you into wasting your time have to be really good at\ntricking you.  An example that will be familiar to a lot of people\nis arguing online.  When someone\ncontradicts you, they're in a sense attacking you. Sometimes pretty\novertly.  Your instinct when attacked is to defend yourself.  But\nlike a lot of instincts, this one wasn't designed for the world we\nnow live in.  Counterintuitive as it feels, it's better most of\nthe time not to defend yourself.  Otherwise these people are literally\ntaking your life.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f2n\"><font color=\"#999999\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Arguing online is only incidentally addictive. There are more\ndangerous things than that. As I've written before, one byproduct\nof technical progress is that things we like tend to become <a href=\"addiction.html\"><u>more\naddictive</u></a>.  Which means we will increasingly have to make a conscious\neffort to avoid addictions Â— to stand outside ourselves and ask \"is\nthis how I want to be spending my time?\"<br/><br/>As well as avoiding bullshit, one should actively seek out things\nthat matter.  But different things matter to different people, and\nmost have to learn what matters to them.  A few are lucky and realize\nearly on that they love math or taking care of animals or writing,\nand then figure out a way to spend a lot of time doing it.  But\nmost people start out with a life that's a mix of things that\nmatter and things that don't, and only gradually learn to distinguish\nbetween them.<br/><br/>For the young especially, much of this confusion is induced by the\nartificial situations they find themselves in. In middle school and\nhigh school, what the other kids think of you seems the most important\nthing in the world.  But when you ask adults what they got wrong\nat that age, nearly all say they cared too much what other kids\nthought of them.<br/><br/>One heuristic for distinguishing stuff that matters is to ask\nyourself whether you'll care about it in the future.  Fake stuff\nthat matters usually has a sharp peak of seeming to matter.  That's\nhow it tricks you.  The area under the curve is small, but its shape\njabs into your consciousness like a pin.<br/><br/>The things that matter aren't necessarily the ones people would\ncall \"important.\"  Having coffee with a friend matters.  You won't\nfeel later like that was a waste of time.<br/><br/>One great thing about having small children is that they make you\nspend time on things that matter: them. They grab your sleeve as\nyou're staring at your phone and say \"will you play with me?\" And\nodds are that is in fact the bullshit-minimizing option.<br/><br/>If life is short, we should expect its shortness to take us by\nsurprise. And that is just what tends to happen.  You take things\nfor granted, and then they're gone.  You think you can always write\nthat book, or climb that mountain, or whatever, and then you realize\nthe window has closed.  The saddest windows close when other people\ndie. Their lives are short too.  After my mother died, I wished I'd\nspent more time with her.  I lived as if she'd always be there.\nAnd in her typical quiet way she encouraged that illusion.  But an\nillusion it was. I think a lot of people make the same mistake I\ndid.<br/><br/>The usual way to avoid being taken by surprise by something is to\nbe consciously aware of it.  Back when life was more precarious,\npeople used to be aware of death to a degree that would now seem a\nbit morbid.  I'm not sure why, but it doesn't seem the right answer\nto be constantly reminding oneself of the grim reaper hovering at\neveryone's shoulder.  Perhaps a better solution is to look at the\nproblem from the other end. Cultivate a habit of impatience about\nthe things you most want to do. Don't wait before climbing that\nmountain or writing that book or visiting your mother.  You don't\nneed to be constantly reminding yourself why you shouldn't wait.\nJust don't wait.<br/><br/>I can think of two more things one does when one doesn't have much\nof something: try to get more of it, and savor what one has.  Both\nmake sense here.<br/><br/>How you live affects how long you live.  Most people could do better.\nMe among them.<br/><br/>But you can probably get even more effect by paying closer attention\nto the time you have.  It's easy to let the days rush by.  The\n\"flow\" that imaginative people love so much has a darker cousin\nthat prevents you from pausing to savor life amid the daily slurry\nof errands and alarms.  One of the most striking things I've read\nwas not in a book, but the title of one: James Salter's <i>Burning\nthe Days</i>.<br/><br/>It is possible to slow time somewhat. I've gotten better at it.\nKids help.  When you have small children, there are a lot of moments\nso perfect that you can't help noticing.<br/><br/>It does help too to feel that you've squeezed everything out of\nsome experience.  The reason I'm sad about my mother is not just\nthat I miss her but that I think of all the things we could have\ndone that we didn't.  My oldest son will be 7 soon.  And while I\nmiss the 3 year old version of him, I at least don't have any regrets\nover what might have been.  We had the best time a daddy and a 3\nyear old ever had.<br/><br/>Relentlessly prune bullshit, don't wait to do things that matter,\nand savor the time you have.  That's what you do when life is short.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nAt first I didn't like it that the word that came to mind was\none that had other meanings.  But then I realized the other meanings\nare fairly closely related.  Bullshit in the sense of things you\nwaste your time on is a lot like intellectual bullshit.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nI chose this example deliberately as a note to self.  I get\nattacked a lot online.  People tell the craziest lies about me.\nAnd I have so far done a pretty mediocre job of suppressing the\nnatural human inclination to say \"Hey, that's not true!\"<br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Jessica Livingston and Geoff Ralston for reading drafts\nof this.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
