{"href":"credentials.html","title":"After Credentials","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">December 2008<br/><br/>A few months ago I read a <i>New York Times</i> article on South\nKorean cram schools that said <blockquote>\n  Admission to the right university can make or break an ambitious\n  young South Korean.\n</blockquote> A parent added: <blockquote>\n  \"In our country, college entrance exams determine 70 to 80 percent\n  of a person's future.\"\n</blockquote> It was striking how old fashioned this sounded.  And\nyet when I was in high school it wouldn't have seemed too far off\nas a description of the US.  Which means things must have been\nchanging here.<br/><br/>The course of people's lives in the US now seems to be determined\nless by credentials and more by performance than it was 25 years\nago.  Where you go to college still matters, but not like it used\nto.<br/><br/>What happened?<br/><br/><center>_____</center><br/><br/>Judging people by their academic credentials was in its time an\nadvance.  The practice seems to have begun in China, where starting\nin 587 candidates for the imperial civil service had to take an\nexam on classical literature.  <font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/credentials.html#f1n\"><font color=\"#999999\">1</font></a>]</font> It was also a test of wealth,\nbecause the knowledge it tested was so specialized that passing\nrequired years of expensive training.  But though wealth was a\nnecessary condition for passing, it was not a sufficient one.  By\nthe standards of the rest of the world in 587, the Chinese system\nwas very enlightened.  Europeans didn't introduce formal civil\nservice exams till the nineteenth century, and even then they seem\nto have been influenced by the Chinese example.<br/><br/>Before credentials, government positions were obtained mainly by\nfamily influence, if not outright bribery.   It was a great step\nforward to judge people by their performance on a test.  But by no\nmeans a perfect solution.  When you judge people that way, you tend\nto get cram schools—which they did in Ming China and nineteenth\ncentury England just as much as in present day South Korea.<br/><br/>What cram schools are, in effect, is leaks in a seal.  The use of\ncredentials\nwas an attempt to seal off the direct transmission of power between\ngenerations, and cram schools represent that power finding holes\nin the seal.  Cram schools turn wealth in one generation into\ncredentials in the next.<br/><br/>It's hard to beat this phenomenon, because the schools adjust to suit\nwhatever the tests measure.  When the tests are narrow and\npredictable, you get cram schools on the classic model, like those\nthat prepared candidates for Sandhurst (the British West Point) or\nthe classes American students take now to improve their SAT scores.\nBut as the tests get broader, the schools do too.  Preparing a\ncandidate for the Chinese imperial civil service exams took years,\nas prep school does today.  But the raison d'etre of all these\ninstitutions has been the same: to beat the system.  <font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/credentials.html#f2n\"><font color=\"#999999\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/><center>_____</center><br/><br/>History suggests that, all other things being equal, a society\nprospers in proportion to its ability to prevent parents from\ninfluencing their children's success directly.  It's a fine thing\nfor parents to help their children indirectly—for example,\nby helping them to become smarter or more disciplined, which then\nmakes them more successful.  The problem comes when parents use\ndirect methods: when they are able to use their own wealth or power\nas a substitute for their children's qualities.<br/><br/>Parents will tend to do this when they can.  Parents will die for\ntheir kids, so it's not surprising to find they'll also push their\nscruples to the limits for them.  Especially if other parents are\ndoing it.<br/><br/>Sealing off this force has a double advantage.  Not only does a\nsociety get \"the best man for the job,\" but\nparents' ambitions are diverted from direct methods to indirect\nones—to actually trying to raise their kids well.<br/><br/>But we should expect it to be very hard to contain parents' efforts\nto obtain an unfair advantage for their kids.  We're dealing with\none of the most powerful forces in human nature.  We shouldn't expect\nnaive solutions to work, any more than we'd expect naive solutions\nfor keeping heroin out of a prison to work.<br/><br/><center>_____</center><br/><br/>The obvious way to solve the problem is to make credentials better.\nIf the tests a society uses are currently hackable, we can study\nthe way people beat them and try to plug the holes.  You can use\nthe cram schools to show you where most of the holes are.  They\nalso tell you when you're succeeding in fixing them: when cram\nschools become less popular.<br/><br/>A more general solution\nwould be to push for increased transparency, especially at critical\nsocial bottlenecks like college admissions.  In the US this process\nstill shows many outward signs of corruption.  For example, legacy\nadmissions.  The official story is that legacy status doesn't carry\nmuch weight, because all it does is break ties: applicants are\nbucketed by ability, and legacy status is only used to decide between\nthe applicants in the bucket that straddles the cutoff.  But what\nthis means is that a university can make legacy status have as much\nor as little weight as they want, by adjusting the size of the\nbucket that straddles the cutoff.<br/><br/>By gradually chipping away at the abuse of credentials, you could\nprobably make them more airtight.  But what a long fight it would\nbe.  Especially when the institutions administering the tests don't\nreally want them to be airtight.<br/><br/><center>_____</center><br/><br/>Fortunately there's a better way to prevent the direct transmission\nof power between generations.  Instead of trying to make credentials\nharder to hack, we can also make them matter less.<br/><br/>Let's think about what credentials are for.  What they are,\nfunctionally, is a way of predicting performance.  If you could\nmeasure actual performance, you wouldn't need them.<br/><br/>So why did they even evolve?  Why haven't we just been measuring\nactual performance?  Think about where credentialism first appeared:\nin selecting candidates for large organizations.  Individual\nperformance is hard to measure in large organizations, and the\nharder performance is to measure, the more important it is\nto predict it.  If an organization could immediately and cheaply\nmeasure the performance of recruits, they wouldn't need to examine\ntheir credentials.  They could take everyone and keep just the good\nones.<br/><br/>Large organizations can't do this.  But a bunch of small organizations\nin a market can come close.  A market takes every organization and\nkeeps just the good ones.  As organizations get smaller, this\napproaches taking every person and keeping just the good ones.  So\nall other things being equal, a society consisting of more, smaller\norganizations will care less about credentials.<br/><br/><center>_____</center><br/><br/>That's what's been happening in the US.  That's why those quotes\nfrom Korea sound so old fashioned.  They're talking about an economy\nlike America's a few decades ago, dominated by a few big companies.\nThe route for the ambitious in that sort of environment is to join\none and climb to the top.  Credentials matter a lot then.  In the \nculture of a large organization, an elite pedigree becomes a self-fulfilling\nprophecy.<br/><br/>This doesn't work in small companies.  Even if your colleagues were\nimpressed by your credentials, they'd soon be parted from you if\nyour performance didn't match, because the company would go out of\nbusiness and the people would be dispersed.<br/><br/>In a world of small companies, performance is all anyone cares\nabout.  People hiring for a startup don't care whether you've even\ngraduated from college, let alone which one.  All they care about\nis what you can do.  Which is in fact all that should matter, even\nin a large organization.  The reason credentials have such prestige\nis that for so long the large organizations\nin a society tended to be the most powerful.  But in the US at least\nthey don't have the monopoly on power they once did, precisely\nbecause they can't measure (and thus reward) individual performance.\nWhy spend twenty years climbing the corporate ladder when you can\nget rewarded directly by the market?<br/><br/>I realize I see a more exaggerated version of the change than most\nother people.  As a partner at an early stage venture funding firm,\nI'm like a jumpmaster shoving people out of the old world of\ncredentials and into the new one of performance.  I'm an agent of\nthe change I'm seeing.  But I don't think I'm imagining it.  It was\nnot so easy 25 years ago for an ambitious person to choose to be\njudged directly by the market.  You had to go through bosses, and\nthey were influenced by where you'd been to college.<br/><br/><center>_____</center><br/><br/>What made it possible for small organizations to succeed in America?\nI'm still not entirely sure.  Startups are certainly a large part\nof it.  Small organizations can develop new ideas faster than large\nones, and new ideas are increasingly valuable.<br/><br/>But I don't think startups account for all the shift from credentials\nto measurement.  My friend Julian Weber told me that when he went\nto work for a New York law firm in the 1950s they paid associates\nfar less than firms do today.  Law firms then made no pretense of\npaying people according to the value of the work they'd done.  Pay\nwas based on seniority.  The younger employees were paying their\ndues.  They'd be rewarded later.<br/><br/>The same principle prevailed at industrial companies.  When my\nfather was working at Westinghouse in the 1970s, he had people\nworking for him who made more than he did, because they'd been there\nlonger.<br/><br/>Now companies increasingly have to pay employees market price for\nthe work they do.   One reason is that employees no longer trust\ncompanies to deliver \n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/ladder.html\">deferred rewards</a>: why work to accumulate\ndeferred rewards at a company that might go bankrupt, or be taken\nover and have all its implicit obligations wiped out?  The other\nis that some companies broke ranks and started to pay young employees\nlarge amounts.  This was particularly true in consulting, law, and\nfinance, where it led to the phenomenon of yuppies.  The word is\nrarely used today because it's no longer surprising to see a 25\nyear old with money, but in 1985 the sight of a 25 year old\n<i>professional</i> able to afford a new BMW was so novel that it\ncalled forth a new word.<br/><br/>The classic yuppie worked for a small organization.  He didn't work\nfor General Widget, but for the law firm that handled General\nWidget's acquisitions or the investment bank that floated their\nbond issues.<br/><br/>Startups and yuppies entered the American conceptual vocabulary\nroughly simultaneously in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  I don't\nthink there was a causal connection.  Startups happened because\ntechnology started to change so fast that big companies could no\nlonger keep a lid on the smaller ones.  I don't think the rise of\nyuppies was inspired by it; it seems more as if there was a change\nin the social conventions (and perhaps the laws) governing the way\nbig companies worked.  But the two phenomena rapidly fused to produce\na principle that now seems obvious: paying energetic young people\nmarket rates, and getting correspondingly high performance from\nthem.<br/><br/>At about the same time the US economy rocketed out of the doldrums\nthat had afflicted it for most of the 1970s.  Was there a connection?\nI don't know enough to say, but it felt like it at the time.  There\nwas a lot of energy released.<br/><br/><center>_____</center><br/><br/>Countries worried about their competitiveness are right to be\nconcerned about the number of startups started within them.  But\nthey would do even better to examine the underlying principle.  Do\nthey let energetic young people get paid market rate for the work\nthey do?  The young are the test, because when people aren't rewarded\naccording to performance, they're invariably rewarded according to\nseniority instead.<br/><br/>All it takes is a few beachheads in your economy that pay for\nperformance.  Measurement spreads like heat.  If one part of a\nsociety is better at measurement than others, it tends to push the\nothers to do better.  If people who are young but smart and driven\ncan make more by starting their own companies than by working for\nexisting ones, the existing companies are forced to pay more to\nkeep them.  So market rates gradually permeate every organization,\neven the government.  <font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/credentials.html#f3n\"><font color=\"#999999\">3</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The measurement of performance will tend to push even the organizations\nissuing credentials into line.  When we were kids I used to annoy\nmy sister by ordering her to do things I knew she was about to do\nanyway.  As credentials are superseded by performance, a similar\nrole is the best former gatekeepers can hope for.  Once credential\ngranting institutions are no longer in the self-fullfilling prophecy\nbusiness, they'll have to work harder to predict the future.<br/><br/><center>_____</center><br/><br/>Credentials are a step beyond bribery and influence.  But they're\nnot the final step.  There's an even better way to block the\ntransmission of power between generations: to encourage the trend\ntoward an economy made of more, smaller units.  Then you can measure\nwhat credentials merely predict.<br/><br/>No one likes the transmission of power between generations—not\nthe left or the right.  But the market forces favored by the right\nturn out to be a better way of preventing it than the credentials\nthe left are forced to fall back on.<br/><br/>The era of credentials began to end when the power of large\norganizations <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/highres.html\">peaked</a> \nin the late twentieth century.  Now we seem\nto be entering a new era based on measurement.  The reason the new\nmodel has advanced so rapidly is that it works so much better.  It\nshows no sign of slowing.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>] Miyazaki, Ichisada\n(Conrad Schirokauer trans.), <i>China's Examination Hell: The Civil\nService Examinations of Imperial China,</i> Yale University Press,\n1981.<br/><br/>Scribes in ancient Egypt took exams, but they were more the type\nof proficiency test any apprentice might have to pass.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>] When I say the\nraison d'etre of prep schools is to get kids into better colleges,\nI mean this in the narrowest sense.
