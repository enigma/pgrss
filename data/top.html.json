I knew it was a good\ntime to have ideas.  Now I'd go further: now I'd say it's hard to\ndo a really good job on anything you don't think about in the shower.<br/><br/>Everyone who's worked on difficult problems is probably familiar\nwith the phenomenon of working hard to figure something out, failing,\nand then suddenly seeing the answer a bit later while doing something\nelse. There's a kind of thinking you do without trying to.  I'm\nincreasingly convinced this type of thinking is not merely helpful\nin solving hard problems, but necessary.  The tricky part is, you\ncan only control it indirectly.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/top.html#f1n\"><font color=\"#999999\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>I think most people have one top idea in their mind at any given\ntime.  That's the idea their thoughts will drift toward when they're\nallowed to drift freely.  And this idea will thus tend to get all\nthe benefit of that type of thinking, while others are starved of\nit.  Which means it's a disaster to let the wrong idea become the\ntop one in your mind.<br/><br/>What made this clear to me was having an idea I didn't want as the\ntop one in my mind for two long stretches.<br/><br/>I'd noticed startups got way less done when they started raising\nmoney, but it was not till we ourselves raised money that I understood\nwhy.  The problem is not the actual time it takes to meet with\ninvestors.  The problem is that once you start raising money, raising\nmoney becomes the top idea in your mind.  That becomes what you\nthink about when you take a shower in the morning.  And that means\nother questions aren't.<br/><br/>I'd hated raising money when I was running Viaweb, but I'd forgotten\nwhy I hated it so much.  When we raised money for Y Combinator, I\nremembered.  Money matters are particularly likely to become the\ntop idea in your mind.  The reason is that they have to be.  It's\nhard to get money.  It's not the sort of thing that happens by\ndefault.  It's not going to happen unless you let it become the\nthing you think about in the shower.  And then you'll make little\nprogress on anything else you'd rather be working on.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/top.html#f2n\"><font color=\"#999999\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>(I hear similar complaints from friends who are professors.  Professors\nnowadays seem to have become professional fundraisers who do a\nlittle research on the side.  It may be time to fix that.)<br/><br/>The reason this struck me so forcibly is that for most of the\npreceding 10 years I'd been able to think about what I wanted.  So\nthe contrast when I couldn't was sharp.  But I don't think this\nproblem is unique to me, because just about every startup I've seen\ngrinds to a halt when they start raising money  or <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/corpdev.html\"><font color=\"#000099\">talking\nto acquirers</font></a>.<br/><br/>You can't directly control where your thoughts drift.  If you're\ncontrolling them, they're not drifting.  But you can control them\nindirectly, by controlling what situations you let yourself get\ninto.  That has been the lesson for me: be careful what you let\nbecome critical to you.  Try to get yourself into situations where\nthe most urgent problems are ones you want to think about.<br/><br/>You don't have complete control, of course.  An emergency could\npush other thoughts out of your head.  But barring emergencies you\nhave a good deal of indirect control over what becomes the top idea\nin your mind.<br/><br/>I've found there are two types of thoughts especially worth\navoiding  thoughts like the Nile Perch in the way they push\nout more interesting ideas.  One I've already mentioned: thoughts\nabout money. Getting money is almost by definition an attention\nsink.\nThe other is disputes.  These too are engaging in the\nwrong way: they have the same velcro-like shape as genuinely\ninteresting ideas, but without the substance.  So avoid disputes\nif you want to get real work done.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/top.html#f3n\"><font color=\"#999999\">3</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Even Newton fell into this trap.  After publishing his theory of\ncolors in 1672 he found himself distracted by disputes for years,\nfinally concluding that the only solution was to stop publishing:\n<blockquote>\n  I see I have made myself a slave to Philosophy, but if I get free\n  of Mr Linus's business I will resolutely bid adew to it eternally,\n  excepting what I do for my privat satisfaction or leave to come\n  out after me.  For I see a man must either resolve to put out\n  nothing new or become a slave to defend it.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/top.html#f4n\"><font color=\"#999999\">4</font></a>]</font>\n</blockquote>\nLinus and his students at Liege were among the more tenacious\ncritics.  Newton's biographer Westfall seems to feel he was\noverreacting:\n<blockquote>\n  Recall that at the time he wrote, Newton's \"slavery\" consisted\n  of five replies to Liege, totalling fourteen printed pages, over\n  the course of a year.\n</blockquote>\nI'm more sympathetic to Newton. The problem was not the 14 pages,\nbut the pain of having this stupid controversy constantly reintroduced\nas the top idea in a mind that wanted so eagerly to think about\nother things.<br/><br/>Turning the other cheek turns out to have selfish advantages.\nSomeone who does you an injury hurts you twice: first by the injury\nitself, and second by taking up your time afterward thinking about\nit.  If you learn to ignore injuries you can at least avoid the\nsecond half.  I've found I can to some extent avoid thinking about\nnasty things people have done to me by telling myself: this doesn't\ndeserve space in my head.  I'm always delighted to find I've forgotten\nthe details of disputes, because that means I hadn't been thinking\nabout them.  My wife thinks I'm more forgiving than she is, but my\nmotives are purely selfish.<br/><br/>I suspect a lot of people aren't sure what's the top idea in their\nmind at any given time.  I'm often mistaken about it.  I tend to\nthink it's the idea I'd want to be the top one, rather than the one\nthat is.  But it's easy to figure this out: just take a shower.\nWhat topic do your thoughts keep returning to?  If it's not what\nyou want to be thinking about, you may want to change something.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nNo doubt there are already names for this type of thinking, but\nI call it \"ambient thought.\"<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nThis was made particularly clear in our case, because neither\nof the funds we raised was difficult, and yet in both cases the\nprocess dragged on for months.  Moving large amounts of money around\nis never something people treat casually.  The attention required\nincreases with the amount—maybe not linearly, but definitely\nmonotonically.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nCorollary: Avoid becoming an administrator, or your job will\nconsist of dealing with money and disputes.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f4n\"><font color=\"#000000\">4</font></a>]\nLetter to Oldenburg, quoted in Westfall, Richard, <i>Life of\nIsaac Newton</i>, p. 107.<br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Patrick Collison, Jessica Livingston,\nand Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.<br/><br/></br></p></font>","date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
