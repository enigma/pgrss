{"href":"inequality.html","title":"Inequality and Risk","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">August 2005<br/><br/><i>(This essay is derived from a talk at Defcon 2005.)</i><br/><br/>Suppose you wanted to get rid of economic inequality.  There are\ntwo ways to do it: give money to the poor, or take it away from the \nrich.  But they amount to the same thing, because if you want to\ngive money to the poor, you have to get it from somewhere.  You\ncan't get it from the poor, or they just end up where they started.\nYou have to get it from the rich.<br/><br/>There is of course a way to make the poor richer without simply\nshifting money from the rich.  You could help the poor become more\nproductive — for example, by improving access to education.  Instead\nof taking money from engineers and giving it to checkout clerks,\nyou could enable people who would have become checkout clerks to\nbecome engineers.<br/><br/>This is an excellent strategy for making the poor richer.  But the\nevidence of the last 200 years shows that it doesn't reduce economic\ninequality, because it makes the rich richer too.  If there\nare more engineers, then there are more opportunities to hire them\nand to sell them things.  Henry Ford couldn't have made a fortune  \nbuilding cars in a society in which most people were still subsistence\nfarmers; he would have had neither workers nor customers.<br/><br/>If you want to reduce economic inequality instead of just improving\nthe overall standard of living, it's not enough just to raise up  \nthe poor.  What if one of your newly minted engineers gets ambitious\nand goes on to become another Bill Gates?  Economic inequality will\nbe as bad as ever.  If you actually want to compress the gap between\nrich and poor, you have to push down on the top as well as pushing\nup on the bottom.<br/><br/>How do you push down on the top?  You could try to decrease the\nproductivity of the people who make the most money: make the best   \nsurgeons operate with their left hands, force popular actors to\novereat, and so on.  But this approach is hard to implement.  The\nonly practical solution is to let people do the best work they can,\nand then (either by taxation or by limiting what they can charge)\nto confiscate whatever you deem to be surplus.<br/><br/>So let's be clear what reducing economic inequality means.  It is   \nidentical with taking money from the rich.<br/><br/>When you transform a mathematical expression into another form, you\noften notice new things.  So it is in this case.  Taking money from\nthe rich turns out to have consequences one might not foresee when\none phrases the same idea in terms of \"reducing inequality.\"<br/><br/>The problem is, risk and reward have to be proportionate.  A bet  \nwith only a 10% chance of winning has to pay more than one with a\n50% chance of winning, or no one will take it.  So if you lop off\nthe top of the possible rewards, you thereby decrease people's\nwillingness to take risks.<br/><br/>Transposing into our original expression, we get: decreasing economic\ninequality means decreasing the risk people are willing to take.<br/><br/>There are whole classes of risks that are no longer worth taking    \nif the maximum return is decreased.  One reason high tax rates are\ndisastrous is that this class of risks includes starting new\ncompanies.<br/><br/><b>Investors</b><br/><br/>Startups are intrinsically risky.  A startup\nis like a small boat\nin the open sea.  One big wave and you're sunk.  A competing product,\na downturn in the economy, a delay in getting funding or regulatory\napproval, a patent suit, changing technical standards, the departure\nof a key employee, the loss of a big account — any one of these can\ndestroy you overnight.  It seems only about 1 in 10 startups succeeds.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f1n\"><font color=\"#777777\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Our startup paid its first round of outside investors 36x.  Which   \nmeant, with current US tax rates, that it made sense to invest in\nus if we had better than a 1 in 24 chance of succeeding.  That  \nsounds about right.  That's probably roughly how we looked when we\nwere a couple of nerds with no business experience operating out\nof an apartment.<br/><br/>If that kind of risk doesn't pay, venture investing, as we know it,\ndoesn't happen.<br/><br/>That might be ok if there were other sources of capital for new\ncompanies.  Why not just have the government, or some large\nalmost-government organization like Fannie Mae, do the venture\ninvesting instead of private funds?<br/><br/>I'll tell you why that wouldn't work. Because then you're asking\ngovernment or almost-government employees to do the one thing they \nare least able to do: take risks.<br/><br/>As anyone who has worked for the government knows, the important\nthing is not to make the right choices, but to make choices that\ncan be justified later if they fail.  If there is a safe option,\nthat's the one a bureaucrat will choose.   But that is exactly the  \nwrong way to do venture investing.  The nature of the business means\nthat you want to make terribly risky choices, if the upside looks\ngood enough.<br/><br/>VCs are currently \n<a href=\"venturecapital.html\">paid</a> in a way that makes them \nfocus on the upside:\nthey get a percentage of the fund's gains.  And that helps overcome\ntheir understandable fear of investing in a company run by nerds\nwho look like (and perhaps are) college students.<br/><br/>If VCs weren't allowed to get rich, they'd behave like bureaucrats.\nWithout hope of gain, they'd have only fear of loss.  And so they'd\nmake the wrong choices.  They'd turn down the nerds in favor of the\nsmooth-talking MBA in a suit, because that investment would be\neasier to justify later if it failed.<br/><br/><b>Founders</b><br/><br/>But even if you could somehow redesign venture funding to work\nwithout allowing VCs to become rich, there's another kind of investor\nyou simply cannot replace: the startups' founders and early employees.<br/><br/>What they invest is their time and ideas.  But these are equivalent\nto money; the proof is that investors are willing (if forced) to\ntreat them as interchangeable, granting the same status to \"sweat   \nequity\" and the equity they've purchased with cash.<br/><br/>The fact that you're investing time doesn't change the relationship\nbetween risk and reward.  If you're going to invest your time in\nsomething with a small chance of succeeding, you'll only do it if\nthere is a proportionately large payoff.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f2n\"><font color=\"#777777\">2</font></a>]</font>\nIf large payoffs aren't allowed, you may as well play it safe.<br/><br/>Like many startup founders, I did it to get rich.  But not because \nI wanted to buy expensive things.  What I wanted was security.  I   \nwanted to make enough money that I didn't have to worry about money.\nIf I'd been forbidden to make enough from a startup to do this, I\nwould have sought security by some other means: for example, by\ngoing to work for a big, stable organization from which it would\nbe hard to get fired.  Instead of busting my ass in a startup, I    \nwould have tried to get a nice, low-stress job at a big research \nlab, or tenure at a university.<br/><br/>That's what everyone does in societies where risk isn't rewarded.\nIf you can't ensure your own security, the next best thing is to\nmake a nest for yourself in some large organization where your\nstatus depends mostly on <a href=\"ladder.html\">seniority</a>.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f3n\"><font color=\"#777777\">3</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Even if we could somehow replace investors, I don't see how we could\nreplace founders.  Investors mainly contribute money, which in\nprinciple is the same no matter what the source.  But the founders\ncontribute ideas.  You can't replace those.<br/><br/>Let's rehearse the chain of argument so far.  I'm heading for a \nconclusion to which many readers will have to be dragged kicking   \nand screaming, so I've tried to make each link unbreakable.  Decreasing\neconomic inequality means taking money from the rich.  Since risk\nand reward are equivalent, decreasing potential rewards automatically\ndecreases people's appetite for risk.  Startups are intrinsically\nrisky.  Without the prospect of rewards proportionate to the risk,\nfounders will not invest their time in a startup.  Founders are\nirreplaceable.  So eliminating economic inequality means eliminating\nstartups.<br/><br/>Economic inequality is not just a consequence of startups.\nIt's the engine that drives them, in the same way a fall of water   \ndrives a water mill.  People start startups in the hope of becoming\nmuch richer than they were before.  And if your society tries to\nprevent anyone from being much richer than anyone else, it will\nalso prevent one person from being much richer at t2 than t1.<br/><br/><b>Growth</b><br/><br/>This argument applies proportionately.  It's not just that if you  \neliminate economic inequality, you get no startups.  To the extent \nyou reduce economic inequality, you decrease the number of startups.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f4n\"><font color=\"#777777\">4</font></a>]</font>\nIncrease taxes, and willingness to take risks decreases in\nproportion.<br/><br/>And that seems bad for everyone.  New technology and new jobs both\ncome disproportionately from new companies.  Indeed, if you don't\nhave startups, pretty soon you won't have established companies\neither, just as, if you stop having kids, pretty soon you won't\nhave any adults.<br/><br/>It sounds benevolent to say we ought to reduce economic inequality. \nWhen you phrase it that way, who can argue with you?  <i>Inequality</i>\nhas to be bad, right?  It sounds a good deal less benevolent to say\nwe ought to reduce the rate at which new companies are founded.\nAnd yet the one implies the other.<br/><br/>Indeed, it may be that reducing investors' appetite for risk doesn't\nmerely kill off larval startups, but kills off the most promising\nones especially.  Startups yield faster growth at greater risk than\nestablished companies.  Does this trend also hold among startups?\nThat is, are the riskiest startups the ones that generate most\ngrowth if they succeed?  I suspect the answer is yes.  And that's   \na chilling thought, because it means that if you cut investors'\nappetite for risk, the most beneficial startups are the first to \ngo.<br/><br/>Not all rich people got that way from startups, of course.  What\nif we let people get rich by starting startups, but taxed away all\nother surplus wealth?  Wouldn't that at least decrease inequality?<br/><br/>Less than you might think.  If you made it so that people could\nonly get rich by starting startups, people who wanted to get rich\nwould all start startups.  And that might be a great thing.  But I\ndon't think it would have much effect on the distribution of wealth.\nPeople who want to get rich will do whatever they have to.  If\nstartups are the only way to do it, you'll just get far more people\nstarting startups.  (If you write the laws very carefully, that is.\nMore likely, you'll just get a lot of people doing things that can\nbe made to look on paper like startups.)<br/><br/>If we're determined to eliminate economic inequality, there is still\none way out: we could say that we're willing to go ahead and do\nwithout startups.  What would happen if we did?<br/><br/>At a minimum, we'd have to accept lower rates of technological   \ngrowth.  If you believe that large, established companies could   \nsomehow be made to develop new technology as fast as startups, the\nball is in your court to explain how.  (If you can come up with a   \nremotely plausible story, you can make a fortune writing business\nbooks and consulting for large companies.)\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f5n\"><font color=\"#777777\">5</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Ok, so we get slower growth.  Is that so bad?  Well, one reason\nit's bad in practice is that other countries might not agree to\nslow down with us.  If you're content to develop new technologies\nat a slower rate than the rest of the world, what happens is that\nyou don't invent anything at all.  Anything you might discover has\nalready been invented elsewhere.  And the only thing you can offer \nin return is raw materials and cheap labor.  Once you sink that\nlow, other countries can do whatever they like with you: install\npuppet governments, siphon off your best workers, use your women\nas prostitutes, dump their toxic waste on your territory — all the\nthings we do to poor countries now.  The only defense is to isolate\nyourself, as communist countries did in the twentieth century.  But\nthe problem then is, you have to become a police state to enforce \nit.\n<!-- Eliminating economic inequality means eliminating startups, and to\nthe extent you do that, you're hosed. --><br/><br/><b>Wealth and Power</b><br/><br/>I realize startups are not the main target of those who want to\neliminate economic inequality.   What they really dislike is the\nsort of wealth that becomes self-perpetuating through an alliance\nwith power. For example, construction firms that fund politicians'\ncampaigns in return for government contracts, or rich parents who   \nget their children into good colleges by sending them to expensive\nschools designed for that purpose.  But if you try to attack this type of wealth\nthrough <i>economic</i> policy, it's hard to hit without destroying\nstartups as collateral damage.<br/><br/>The problem here is not wealth, but corruption.  So why not go after\ncorruption?<br/><br/>We don't need to prevent people from being rich if we can prevent\nwealth from translating into power.  And there has been progress\non that front.  Before he died of drink in 1925, Commodore Vanderbilt's\nwastrel grandson Reggie ran down pedestrians on five separate   \noccasions, killing two of them.  By 1969, when Ted Kennedy drove  \noff the bridge at Chappaquiddick, the limit seemed to be down to  \none.  Today it may well be zero.  But what's changed is not variation\nin wealth.  What's changed is the ability to translate wealth into\npower.<br/><br/>How do you break the connection between wealth and power?  Demand   \ntransparency.  Watch closely how power is exercised, and demand an\naccount of how decisions are made.  Why aren't all police interrogations\nvideotaped?  Why did 36% of Princeton's class of 2007 come from\nprep schools, when only 1.7% of American kids attend them?  Why did\nthe US really invade Iraq?  Why don't government officials disclose\nmore about their finances, and why only during their term of office?<br/><br/>A friend of mine who knows a lot about computer security says the\nsingle most important step is to log everything.  Back when he was\na kid trying to break into computers, what worried him most was the\nidea of leaving a trail.  He was more inconvenienced by the need \nto avoid that than by any obstacle deliberately put in his path.<br/><br/>Like all illicit connections, the connection between wealth and     \npower flourishes in secret.  Expose all transactions, and you will\ngreatly reduce it.  Log everything.  That's a strategy that already\nseems to be working, and it doesn't have the side effect of making\nyour whole country poor.<br/><br/>I don't think many people realize there is a connection between\neconomic inequality and risk.  I didn't fully grasp it till recently.\nI'd known for years of course that if one didn't score in a startup,\nthe other alternative was to get a cozy, tenured research job.  But\nI didn't understand the equation governing my behavior.  Likewise, \nit's obvious empirically that a country that doesn't let people get\nrich is headed for disaster, whether it's Diocletian's Rome or  \nHarold Wilson's Britain.  But I did not till recently understand\nthe role risk played.<br/><br/>If you try to attack wealth, you end up nailing risk as well, and  \nwith it growth.  If we want a fairer world, I think we're better  \noff attacking one step downstream, where wealth turns into power.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>\n[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nSuccess here is defined from the initial investors' point of\nview: either an IPO, or an acquisition for more than the valuation\nat the last round of funding.  The conventional 1 in 10 success rate\nis suspiciously neat, but conversations with VCs suggest it's roughly\ncorrect for startups overall.  Top VC firms expect to do better.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nI'm not claiming founders sit down and calculate the expected     \nafter-tax return from a startup.  They're motivated by examples of\nother people who did it.  And those examples do reflect after-tax returns.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nConjecture: The variation in wealth in a (non-corrupt) \ncountry or organization\nwill be inversely proportional to the prevalence of systems of\nseniority.  So if you suppress variation in wealth, seniority will\nbecome correspondingly more important.  So far, I know of no\ncounterexamples, though in very corrupt countries you may get \nboth simultaneously.  (Thanks to Daniel Sobral for pointing\nthis out.)<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f4n\"><font color=\"#000000\">4</font></a>]\nIn a country with a truly feudal economy, you might be able to\nredistribute wealth successfully, because there are no startups to\nkill.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f5n\"><font color=\"#000000\">5</font></a>]\nThe speed at which startups develop new techology is the other     \nreason they pay so well.  As I explained in <a href=\"wealth.html\">\"How to Make Wealth\"</a>, what you do in a startup is compress a\nlifetime's worth of work into a few years.  It seems as\ndumb to discourage that as to discourage risk-taking.<br/><br/>\n<b>Thanks</b> to Chris Anderson, Trevor Blackwell, Dan Giffin,\nJessica Livingston, and Evan Williams for reading drafts of this\nessay, and to Langley Steinert, Sangam Pant, and Mike Moritz for\ninformation about venture investing.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2005-08-01T00:00:00Z"}
