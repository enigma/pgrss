{"href":"nerds.html","title":"Why Nerds are Unpopular","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">February 2003<br/><br/>When we were in junior high school, my friend Rich and I made a map\nof the school lunch tables according to popularity. This was easy\nto do, because kids only ate lunch with others of about the same\npopularity. We graded them from A to E. A tables were full of\nfootball players and cheerleaders and so on. E tables contained the\nkids with mild cases of Down's Syndrome, what in the language of\nthe time we called \"retards.\"<br/><br/>We sat at a D table, as low as you could get without looking\nphysically different. We were not being especially candid to grade\nourselves as D. It would have taken a deliberate lie to say otherwise.\nEveryone in the school knew exactly how popular everyone else was,\nincluding us.<br/><br/>My stock gradually rose during high school. Puberty finally arrived;\nI became a decent soccer player; I started a scandalous underground\nnewspaper.  So I've seen a good part of the popularity landscape.<br/><br/>I know a lot of people who were nerds in school, and they all tell\nthe same story: there is a strong correlation between being smart\nand being a nerd, and an even stronger inverse correlation between\nbeing a nerd and being popular. Being smart seems to <i>make</i> you\nunpopular.<br/><br/>Why? To someone in school now, that may seem an odd question to\nask. The mere fact is so overwhelming that it may seem strange to\nimagine that it could be any other way. But it could. Being smart\ndoesn't make you an outcast in elementary school. Nor does it harm\nyou in the real world. Nor, as far as I can tell, is the problem\nso bad in most other countries. But in a typical American secondary\nschool, being smart is likely to make your life difficult.  Why?<br/><br/><br/><br/>\nThe key to this mystery is to rephrase the question slightly. Why\ndon't smart kids make themselves popular? If they're so smart, why\ndon't they figure out how popularity works and beat the system,\njust as they do for standardized tests?<br/><br/>One argument says that this would be impossible, that the smart\nkids are unpopular because the other kids envy them for being smart,\nand nothing they could do could make them popular. I wish. If the\nother kids in junior high school envied me, they did a great job\nof concealing it. And in any case, if being smart were really an\nenviable quality, the girls would have broken ranks. The guys that\nguys envy, girls like.<br/><br/>In the schools I went to, being smart just didn't matter much. Kids\ndidn't admire it or despise it. All other things being equal, they\nwould have preferred to be on the smart side of average rather than the\ndumb side, but intelligence counted far less than, say, physical\nappearance, charisma, or athletic ability.<br/><br/>So if intelligence in itself is not a factor in popularity, why are\nsmart kids so consistently unpopular? The answer, I think, is that\nthey don't really want to be popular.<br/><br/>If someone had told me that at the time, I would have laughed at\nhim. Being unpopular in school makes kids miserable, some of them\nso miserable that they commit suicide. Telling me that I didn't\nwant to be popular would have seemed like telling someone dying of\nthirst in a desert that he didn't want a glass of water. Of course\nI wanted to be popular.<br/><br/>But in fact I didn't, not enough. There was something else I wanted\nmore: to be smart. Not simply to do well in school, though that\ncounted for something, but to design beautiful rockets, or to write\nwell, or to understand how to program computers. In general, to\nmake great things.<br/><br/>At the time I never tried to separate my wants and weigh them\nagainst one another. If I had, I would have seen that being smart\nwas more important. If someone had offered me the chance to be\nthe most popular kid in school, but only at the price of being of\naverage intelligence (humor me here), I wouldn't have taken it.<br/><br/>Much as they suffer from their unpopularity, I don't think many\nnerds would. To them the thought of average intelligence is unbearable.\nBut most kids would take that deal. For half of them, it would be\na step up. Even for someone in the eightieth percentile (assuming,\nas everyone seemed to then, that intelligence is a scalar), who\nwouldn't drop thirty points in exchange for being loved and admired\nby everyone?<br/><br/>And that, I think, is the root of the problem. Nerds serve two\nmasters. They want to be popular, certainly, but they want even\nmore to be smart. And popularity is not something you can do in\nyour spare time, not in the fiercely competitive environment of an\nAmerican secondary school.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\nAlberti, arguably the archetype of the Renaissance Man, writes that\n\"no art, however minor, demands less than total dedication if you\nwant to excel in it.\"\nI wonder if anyone in the world works harder\nat anything than American school kids work at popularity. Navy SEALs\nand neurosurgery residents seem slackers by comparison. They\noccasionally take vacations; some even have hobbies. An American\nteenager may work at being popular every waking hour, 365 days a\nyear.<br/><br/>I don't mean to suggest they do this consciously. Some of them truly\nare little Machiavellis, but what I really mean here is that teenagers\nare always on duty as conformists.<br/><br/>For example, teenage kids pay a great deal of attention to clothes.\nThey don't consciously dress to be popular. They dress to look good.\nBut to who? To the other kids. Other kids' opinions become their\ndefinition of right, not just for clothes, but for almost everything\nthey do, right down to the way they walk. And so every effort they\nmake to do things \"right\" is also, consciously or not, an effort\nto be more popular.<br/><br/>Nerds don't realize this. They don't realize that it takes work to\nbe popular. In general, people outside some very demanding field\ndon't realize the extent to which success depends on constant (though\noften unconscious) effort. For example, most people seem to consider\nthe ability to draw as some kind of innate quality, like being tall.\nIn fact, most people who \"can draw\" like drawing, and have spent\nmany hours doing it; that's why they're good at it. Likewise, popular\nisn't just something you are or you aren't, but something you make\nyourself.<br/><br/>The main reason nerds are unpopular is that they have other things\nto think about. Their attention is drawn to books or the natural\nworld, not fashions and parties. They're like someone trying to\nplay soccer while balancing a glass of water on his head. Other\nplayers who can focus their whole attention on the game beat them\neffortlessly, and wonder why they seem so incapable.<br/><br/>Even if nerds cared as much as other kids about popularity, being\npopular would be more work for them. The popular kids learned to\nbe popular, and to want to be popular, the same way the nerds learned\nto be smart, and to want to be smart: from their parents. While the\nnerds were being trained to get the right answers, the popular kids\nwere being trained to please.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\nSo far I've been finessing the relationship between smart and nerd,\nusing them as if they were interchangeable. In fact it's only the\ncontext that makes them so. A nerd is someone who isn't socially\nadept enough. But \"enough\" depends on where you are. In a typical\nAmerican school, standards for coolness are so high (or at least,\nso specific) that you don't have to be especially awkward to look\nawkward by comparison.<br/><br/>Few smart kids can spare the attention that popularity requires.\nUnless they also happen to be good-looking, natural athletes, or\nsiblings of popular kids, they'll tend to become nerds. And that's\nwhy smart people's lives are worst between, say, the ages of eleven\nand seventeen. Life at that age revolves far more around popularity\nthan before or after.<br/><br/>Before that, kids' lives are dominated by their parents, not by\nother kids. Kids do care what their peers think in elementary school,\nbut this isn't their whole life, as it later becomes.<br/><br/>Around the age of eleven, though, kids seem to start treating their\nfamily as a day job. They create a new world among themselves, and\nstanding in this world is what matters, not standing in their family.\nIndeed, being in trouble in their family can win them points in the\nworld they care about.<br/><br/>The problem is, the world these kids create for themselves is at\nfirst a very crude one. If you leave a bunch of eleven-year-olds\nto their own devices, what you get is <i>Lord of the Flies.</i> Like\na lot of American kids, I read this book in school. Presumably it\nwas not a coincidence. Presumably someone wanted to point out to\nus that we were savages, and that we had made ourselves a cruel and\nstupid world. This was too subtle for me. While the book seemed\nentirely believable, I didn't get the additional message. I wish\nthey had just told us outright that we were savages and our world\nwas stupid.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\nNerds would find their unpopularity more bearable if it merely\ncaused them to be ignored. Unfortunately, to be unpopular in school\nis to be actively persecuted.<br/><br/>Why? Once again, anyone currently in school might think this a\nstrange question to ask. How could things be any other way? But\nthey could be. Adults don't normally persecute nerds. Why do teenage\nkids do it?<br/><br/>Partly because teenagers are still half children, and many\nchildren are just intrinsically cruel. Some torture nerds for the\nsame reason they pull the legs off spiders. Before you develop a\nconscience, torture is amusing.<br/><br/>Another reason kids persecute nerds is to make themselves feel\nbetter. When you tread water, you lift yourself up by pushing water\ndown. Likewise, in any social hierarchy, people unsure of their own\nposition will try to emphasize it by maltreating those they think\nrank below. I've read that this is why poor whites in the United\nStates are the group most hostile to blacks.<br/><br/>But I think the main reason other kids persecute nerds is that it's\npart of the mechanism of popularity. Popularity is only partially\nabout individual attractiveness. It's much more about alliances.\nTo become more popular, you need to be constantly doing things that\nbring you close to other popular people, and nothing brings people\ncloser than a common enemy.<br/><br/>Like a politician who wants to distract voters from bad times at\nhome, you can create an enemy if there isn't a real one. By singling\nout and persecuting a nerd, a group of kids from higher in the\nhierarchy create bonds between themselves. Attacking an outsider\nmakes them all insiders. This is why the worst cases of bullying\nhappen with groups. Ask any nerd: you get much worse treatment from\na group of kids than from any individual bully, however sadistic.<br/><br/>If it's any consolation to the nerds, it's nothing personal. The\ngroup of kids who band together to pick on you are doing the same\nthing, and for the same reason, as a bunch of guys who get together\nto go hunting. They don't actually hate you. They just need something\nto chase.<br/><br/>Because they're at the bottom of the scale, nerds are a safe target\nfor the entire school. If I remember correctly, the most popular\nkids don't persecute nerds; they don't need to stoop to such things.\nMost of the persecution comes from kids lower down, the nervous\nmiddle classes.<br/><br/>The trouble is, there are a lot of them. The distribution of\npopularity is not a pyramid, but tapers at the bottom like a pear.\nThe least popular group is quite small. (I believe we were the only\nD table in our cafeteria map.) So there are more people who want\nto pick on nerds than there are nerds.<br/><br/>As well as gaining points by distancing oneself from unpopular kids,\none loses points by being close to them. A woman I know says that\nin high school she liked nerds, but was afraid to be seen talking\nto them because the other girls would make fun of her. Unpopularity\nis a communicable disease; kids too nice to pick on nerds will still\nostracize them in self-defense.<br/><br/>It's no wonder, then, that smart kids tend to be unhappy in middle\nschool and high school. Their other interests leave them little\nattention to spare for popularity, and since popularity resembles\na zero-sum game, this in turn makes them targets for the whole\nschool. And the strange thing is, this nightmare scenario happens\nwithout any conscious malice, merely because of the shape of the\nsituation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\nFor me the worst stretch was junior high, when kid culture was new\nand harsh, and the specialization that would later gradually separate\nthe smarter kids had barely begun. Nearly everyone I've talked to\nagrees: the nadir is somewhere between eleven and fourteen.<br/><br/>In our school it was eighth grade, which was ages twelve and thirteen\nfor me. There was a brief sensation that year when one of our\nteachers overheard a group of girls waiting for the school bus, and\nwas so shocked that the next day she devoted the whole class to an\neloquent plea not to be so cruel to one another.<br/><br/>It didn't have any noticeable effect. What struck me at the time\nwas that she was surprised. You mean she doesn't know the kind of\nthings they say to one another? You mean this isn't normal?<br/><br/>It's important to realize that, no, the adults don't know what the\nkids are doing to one another. They know, in the abstract, that\nkids are monstrously cruel to one another, just as we know in the\nabstract that people get tortured in poorer countries. But, like\nus, they don't like to dwell on this depressing fact, and they don't\nsee evidence of specific abuses unless they go looking for it.<br/><br/>Public school teachers are in much the same position as prison\nwardens. Wardens' main concern is to keep the prisoners on the\npremises. They also need to keep them fed, and as far as possible\nprevent them from killing one another. Beyond that, they want to\nhave as little to do with the prisoners as possible, so they leave\nthem to create whatever social organization they want. From what\nI've read, the society that the prisoners create is warped, savage,\nand pervasive, and it is no fun to be at the bottom of it.<br/><br/>In outline, it was the same at the schools I went to. The most\nimportant thing was to stay on the premises. While there, the\nauthorities fed you, prevented overt violence, and made some effort\nto teach you something. But beyond that they didn't want to have\ntoo much to do with the kids. Like prison wardens, the teachers\nmostly left us to ourselves. And, like prisoners, the culture we\ncreated was barbaric.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\nWhy is the real world more hospitable to nerds? It might seem that\nthe answer is simply that it's populated by adults, who are too\nmature to pick on one another. But I don't think this is true.\nAdults in prison certainly pick on one another. And so, apparently,\ndo society wives; in some parts of Manhattan, life for women sounds\nlike a continuation of high school, with all the same petty intrigues.<br/><br/>I think the important thing about the real world is not that it's\npopulated by adults, but that it's very large, and the things you\ndo have real effects. That's what school, prison, and ladies-who-lunch\nall lack. The inhabitants of all those worlds are trapped in little\nbubbles where nothing they do can have more than a local effect.\nNaturally these societies degenerate into savagery. They have no\nfunction for their form to follow.<br/><br/>When the things you do have real effects, it's no longer enough\njust to be pleasing. It starts to be important to get the right\nanswers, and that's where nerds show to advantage. Bill Gates will\nof course come to mind. Though notoriously lacking in social skills,\nhe gets the right answers, at least as measured in revenue.<br/><br/>The other thing that's different about the real world is that it's\nmuch larger. In a large enough pool, even the smallest minorities\ncan achieve a critical mass if they clump together. Out in the real\nworld, nerds collect in certain places and form their own societies\nwhere intelligence is the most important thing. Sometimes the current\neven starts to flow in the other direction: sometimes, particularly\nin university math and science departments, nerds deliberately\nexaggerate their awkwardness in order to seem smarter. John Nash\nso admired Norbert Wiener that he adopted his habit of touching the\nwall as he walked down a corridor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\nAs a thirteen-year-old kid, I didn't have much more experience of\nthe world than what I saw immediately around me. The warped little\nworld we lived in was, I thought, <i>the world.</i> The world seemed cruel\nand boring, and I'm not sure which was worse.<br/><br/>Because I didn't fit into this world, I thought that something must\nbe wrong with me. I didn't realize that the reason we nerds didn't\nfit in was that in some ways\nwe were a step ahead. We were already thinking about\nthe kind of things that matter in the real world, instead of spending\nall our time playing an exacting but mostly pointless game like the\nothers.<br/><br/>We were a bit like an adult would be if he were thrust back into\nmiddle school. He wouldn't know the right clothes to wear, the right\nmusic to like, the right slang to use. He'd seem to the kids a\ncomplete alien. The thing is, he'd know enough not to care what\nthey thought. We had no such confidence.<br/><br/>A lot of people seem to think it's good for smart kids to be thrown\ntogether with \"normal\" kids at this stage of their lives. Perhaps.\nBut in at least some cases the reason the nerds don't fit in really\nis that everyone else is crazy. I remember sitting in the audience\nat a \"pep rally\" at my high school, watching as the cheerleaders\nthrew an effigy of an opposing player into the audience to be torn\nto pieces. I felt like an explorer witnessing some bizarre tribal\nritual.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\nIf I could go back and give my thirteen year old self some advice,\nthe main thing I'd tell him would be to stick his head up and look\naround. I didn't really grasp it at the time, but the whole world\nwe lived in was as fake as a Twinkie. Not just school, but the\nentire town. Why do people move to suburbia? To have kids! So no\nwonder it seemed boring and sterile. The whole place was a giant\nnursery, an artificial town created explicitly for the purpose of\nbreeding children.<br/><br/>Where I grew up, it felt as if there was nowhere to go, and nothing\nto do. This was no accident. Suburbs are deliberately designed to\nexclude the outside world, because it contains things that could\nendanger children.<br/><br/>And as for the schools, they were just holding pens within this\nfake world. Officially the purpose of schools is to teach kids. In\nfact their primary purpose is to keep kids locked up in one\nplace for a big chunk of the day so adults can get things done. And\nI have no problem with this: in a specialized industrial society,\nit would be a disaster to have kids running around loose.<br/><br/>What bothers me is not that the kids are kept in prisons, but that\n(a) they aren't told about it, and (b) the prisons are run mostly\nby the inmates. Kids are sent off to spend six years memorizing\nmeaningless facts in a world ruled by a caste of giants who run\nafter an oblong brown ball, as if this were the most natural thing\nin the world. And if they balk at this surreal cocktail, they're\ncalled misfits.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\nLife in this twisted world is stressful for the kids. And not just\nfor the nerds. Like any war, it's damaging even to the winners.<br/><br/>Adults can't avoid seeing that teenage kids are tormented. So why\ndon't they do something about it? Because they blame it on puberty.\nThe reason kids are so unhappy, adults tell themselves, is that\nmonstrous new chemicals, <i>hormones</i>, are now coursing through their\nbloodstream and messing up everything. There's nothing wrong with\nthe system; it's just inevitable that kids will be miserable at\nthat age.<br/><br/>This idea is so pervasive that even the kids believe it, which\nprobably doesn't help. Someone who thinks his feet naturally hurt\nis not going to stop to consider the possibility that he is wearing\nthe wrong size shoes.<br/><br/>I'm suspicious of this theory that thirteen-year-old kids are\nintrinsically messed up. If it's physiological, it should be\nuniversal. Are Mongol nomads all nihilists at thirteen? I've read\na lot of history, and I have not seen a single reference\nto this supposedly universal fact before the twentieth century.\nTeenage apprentices in the Renaissance seem to have been cheerful\nand eager. They got in fights and played tricks on one another of\ncourse (Michelangelo had his nose broken by a bully), but they\nweren't crazy.<br/><br/>As far as I can tell, the concept of the hormone-crazed teenager\nis coeval with suburbia. I don't think this is a coincidence. I\nthink teenagers are driven crazy by the life they're made to lead.\nTeenage apprentices in the Renaissance were working dogs. Teenagers\nnow are neurotic lapdogs. Their craziness is the craziness of the\nidle everywhere.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\nWhen I was in school, suicide was a constant topic among the smarter\nkids. No one I knew did it, but several planned to, and\nsome may have tried. Mostly this was just a pose. Like other\nteenagers, we loved the dramatic, and suicide seemed very dramatic.\nBut partly it was because our lives were at times genuinely miserable.<br/><br/>Bullying was only part of the problem. Another problem, and possibly\nan even worse one, was that we never had anything real to work on.\nHumans like to work; in most of the world, your work is your identity.\nAnd all the work we did was \n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/essay.html\">pointless</a>, or seemed so at the time.<br/><br/>At best it was practice for real work we might do far in the future,\nso far that we didn't even know at the time what we were practicing\nfor. More often it was just an arbitrary series of hoops to jump\nthrough, words without content designed mainly for testability.\n(The three main causes of the Civil War were....\nTest: List the three main causes of the Civil War.)<br/><br/>And there was no way to opt out. The adults had agreed among\nthemselves that this was to be the route to college. The only way\nto escape this empty life was to submit to it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\nTeenage kids used to have a more active role in society. In\npre-industrial times, they were all apprentices of one sort or\nanother, whether in shops or on farms or even on warships. They\nweren't left to create their own societies. They were junior members\nof adult societies.<br/><br/>Teenagers seem to have respected adults more then, because\nthe adults were the visible experts in the skills they were trying\nto learn. Now most kids have little idea what their parents do in\ntheir distant offices, and see no connection (indeed, there is\nprecious little) between schoolwork and the work they'll do as\nadults.<br/><br/>And if teenagers respected adults more, adults also had more use\nfor teenagers. After a couple years' training, an apprentice could\nbe a real help. Even the newest apprentice could be made to carry\nmessages or sweep the workshop.<br/><br/>Now adults have no immediate use for teenagers. They would be in\nthe way in an office. So they drop them off at school on their way\nto work, much as they might drop the dog off at a kennel if they  \nwere going away for the weekend.<br/><br/>What happened? We're up against a hard one here. The cause of this\nproblem is the same as the cause of so many present ills: specialization.\nAs jobs become more specialized, we have to train longer for them.\nKids in pre-industrial times started working at about 14 at\nthe latest; kids on farms, where most people lived, began far  \nearlier. Now kids who go to college don't start working full-time \ntill 21 or 22. With some degrees, like MDs and PhDs, you may not\nfinish your training till 30.<br/><br/>Teenagers now are useless, except as cheap labor in industries like\nfast food, which evolved to exploit precisely this fact. In almost\nany other kind of work, they'd be a net loss. But they're also too \nyoung to be left unsupervised. Someone has to watch over them, and\nthe most efficient way to do this is to collect them together in\none place. Then a few adults can watch all of them.<br/><br/>If you stop there, what you're describing is literally a prison,\nalbeit a part-time one. The problem is, many schools practically\ndo stop there. The stated purpose of schools is to educate the kids.\nBut there is no external pressure to do this well. And so most\nschools do such a bad job of teaching that the kids don't really\ntake it seriously-- not even the smart kids. Much of the time we\nwere all, students and teachers both, just going through the motions.<br/><br/>In my high school French class we were supposed to read Hugo's <i>Les\nMiserables.</i> I don't think any of us knew French well enough to make\nour way through this enormous book. Like the rest of the class, I   \njust skimmed the Cliff's Notes. When we were given a test on the\nbook, I noticed that the questions sounded odd. They were full of   \nlong words that our teacher wouldn't have used. Where had these   \nquestions come from? From the Cliff's Notes, it turned out. The \nteacher was using them too. We were all just pretending.<br/><br/>There are certainly great public school teachers.  The energy and \nimagination of my fourth grade teacher, Mr. Mihalko, made that  \nyear something his students still talk about, thirty years later.\nBut teachers like him were individuals swimming\nupstream. They couldn't fix the system.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\nIn almost any group of people you'll find hierarchy.\nWhen groups of adults form in the real world, it's generally for  \nsome common purpose, and the leaders end up being those who are best\nat it. The problem with most schools is, they have no purpose. \nBut hierarchy there must be.\nAnd so the kids make one out of nothing.<br/><br/>We have a phrase to describe what happens when rankings have to be\ncreated without any meaningful criteria. We say that the situation\n<i>degenerates into a popularity contest.</i> And that's exactly what\nhappens in most American schools.\nInstead of depending on some real test, one's rank\ndepends mostly on one's ability to increase one's rank. It's\nlike the court of Louis XIV. There is no external opponent, so the\nkids become one another's opponents.<br/><br/>When there is some real external test of skill, it isn't painful\nto be at the bottom of the hierarchy. A rookie on a football team\ndoesn't resent the skill of the veteran; he hopes to be like him\none day and is happy to have the chance to learn from him.\nThe veteran may in turn feel a sense of\n<i>noblesse oblige</i>.\nAnd most importantly, their status depends on how well they\ndo against opponents, not on whether they can push the other down.<br/><br/>Court hierarchies are another thing entirely. This type of society\ndebases anyone who enters it. There is neither admiration at the \nbottom, nor <i>noblesse oblige</i> at the top. It's kill or be killed.<br/><br/>This is the sort of society that gets created\nin American\nsecondary schools. And it happens because these schools have no\nreal purpose beyond keeping the kids all in one place for a certain\nnumber of hours each day. What I didn't realize at the time, and\nin fact didn't realize till very recently, is that the twin horrors\nof school life, the cruelty and the boredom, both have the same  \ncause.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\nThe mediocrity of American public schools has worse consequences\nthan just making kids unhappy for six years. It breeds a rebelliousness\nthat actively drives kids away from the things they're supposed to\nbe learning.<br/><br/>Like many nerds, probably, it was years after high school before I\ncould bring myself to read anything we'd been assigned then.\nAnd I lost more than books. I mistrusted words like \"character\" and   \n\"integrity\" because they had been so debased by adults. As they\nwere used then, these words all seemed to mean the same thing:\nobedience. The kids who got praised for these qualities tended to \nbe at best dull-witted prize bulls, and at worst facile schmoozers.\nIf that was what character and integrity were, I wanted no part of\nthem.<br/><br/>The word I most misunderstood was \"tact.\" As used by adults, it\nseemed to mean keeping your mouth shut.\nI assumed it was derived from the same root as\n\"tacit\" and \"taciturn,\" and that it literally meant being quiet. I\nvowed that I would never be tactful; they were never going to shut\nme up. In fact, it's derived from the same root as \"tactile,\" and\nwhat it means is to have a deft touch. Tactful is the opposite of\nclumsy. I don't think I learned this until college.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Nerds aren't the only losers in the popularity rat race. Nerds are\nunpopular because they're distracted. There are other kids who\ndeliberately opt out because they're so disgusted with the whole  \nprocess.<br/><br/>Teenage kids, even rebels, don't like to be alone, so when kids opt\nout of the system, they tend to do it as a group. At the schools I\nwent to, the focus of rebellion was drug use, specifically marijuana.\nThe kids in this tribe wore black concert t-shirts and were called\n\"freaks.\"<br/><br/>Freaks and nerds were allies, and there was a good deal of overlap\nbetween them. Freaks were on the whole smarter than other kids,\nthough never studying (or at least never appearing to) was an   \nimportant tribal value. I was more in the nerd camp, but I was\nfriends with a lot of freaks.<br/><br/>They used drugs, at least at first, for the social bonds they\ncreated. It was something to do together, and because the drugs \nwere illegal, it was a shared badge of rebellion.<br/><br/>I'm not claiming that bad schools are the whole reason kids get\ninto trouble with drugs. After a while, drugs have their own momentum.\nNo doubt some of the freaks ultimately used drugs to escape from  \nother problems-- trouble at home, for example. But, in my school\nat least, the reason most kids <i>started</i> using drugs was rebellion.\nFourteen-year-olds didn't start smoking pot because they'd heard\nit would help them forget their problems. They started because they\nwanted to join a different tribe.<br/><br/>Misrule breeds rebellion; this is not a new idea. And yet the\nauthorities still for the most part act as if drugs were themselves\nthe cause of the problem.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\nThe real problem is the emptiness of school life. We won't see\nsolutions till adults realize that. The adults who\nmay realize it first are the ones who were themselves nerds in  \nschool. Do you want your kids to be as unhappy in eighth grade as\nyou were? I wouldn't. Well, then, is there anything we can do to\nfix things? Almost certainly. There is nothing inevitable about the\ncurrent system. It has come about mostly by default.<br/><br/>Adults, though, are busy. Showing up for school plays is one thing.\nTaking on the educational bureaucracy is another. Perhaps a few\nwill have the energy to try to change things. I suspect the hardest  \npart is realizing that you can.<br/><br/>Nerds still in school should not hold their breath. Maybe one day\na heavily armed force of adults will show up in helicopters to      \nrescue you, but they probably won't be coming this month. Any     \nimmediate improvement in nerds' lives is probably going to have to\ncome from the nerds themselves.<br/><br/>Merely understanding the situation they're in should make it less \npainful. Nerds aren't losers. They're just playing a different game,\nand a game much closer to the one played in the real world. Adults\nknow this. It's hard to find successful adults now who don't claim\nto have been nerds in high school.<br/><br/>It's important for nerds to realize, too, that school is not life.\nSchool is a strange, artificial thing, half sterile and half feral.\nIt's all-encompassing, like life, but it isn't the real thing. It's\nonly temporary, and if you look, you can see beyond it even while\nyou're still in it.<br/><br/>If life seems awful to kids, it's neither because hormones are \nturning you all into monsters (as your parents believe), nor because\nlife actually is awful (as you believe). It's because the adults,\nwho no longer have any economic use for you, have abandoned you to\nspend years cooped up together with nothing real to do.  <i>Any</i> society\nof that type is awful to live in.\nYou don't have\nto look any further to explain why teenage kids are unhappy.<br/><br/>I've said some harsh things in this essay, but really the thesis\nis an optimistic one-- that several problems we take for granted\nare in fact not insoluble after all. Teenage kids are not inherently\nunhappy monsters. That should be encouraging news to kids and adults\nboth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Thanks</b> to Sarah Harlin, Trevor Blackwell, Robert Morris,\nEric Raymond, and Jackie Weicker for reading drafts of this essay,\nand Maria Daniels for scanning photos.<br/><br/><br clear=\"all\"/></font>","date":"2003-02-01T00:00:00Z"}
