{"href":"real.html","title":"The Real Reason to End the Death Penalty","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">April 2021<br/><br/>When intellectuals talk about the death penalty, they talk about\nthings like whether it's permissible for the state to take someone's\nlife, whether the death penalty acts as a deterrent, and whether\nmore death sentences are given to some groups than others. But in\npractice the debate about the death penalty is not about whether\nit's ok to kill murderers. It's about whether it's ok to kill\ninnocent people, because at least 4% of people on death row are\n<a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/111/20/7230\"><u>innocent</u></a>.<br/><br/>When I was a kid I imagined that it was unusual for people to be\nconvicted of crimes they hadn't committed, and that in murder cases\nespecially this must be very rare. Far from it. Now, thanks to\norganizations like the\n<a href=\"https://innocenceproject.org/all-cases\"><u>Innocence Project</u></a>,\nwe see a constant stream\nof stories about murder convictions being overturned after new\nevidence emerges. Sometimes the police and prosecutors were just\nvery sloppy. Sometimes they were crooked, and knew full well they\nwere convicting an innocent person.<br/><br/>Kenneth Adams and three other men spent 18 years in prison on a\nmurder conviction. They were exonerated after DNA testing implicated\nthree different men, two of whom later confessed. The police had\nbeen told about the other men early in the investigation, but never\nfollowed up the lead.<br/><br/>Keith Harward spent 33 years in prison on a murder conviction. He\nwas convicted because \"experts\" said his teeth matched photos of\nbite marks on one victim. He was exonerated after DNA testing showed\nthe murder had been committed by another man, Jerry Crotty.<br/><br/>Ricky Jackson and two other men spent 39 years in prison after being\nconvicted of murder on the testimony of a 12 year old boy, who later\nrecanted and said he'd been coerced by police. Multiple people have\nconfirmed the boy was elsewhere at the time. The three men were\nexonerated after the county prosecutor dropped the charges, saying\n\"The state is conceding the obvious.\"<br/><br/>Alfred Brown spent 12 years in prison on a murder conviction,\nincluding 10 years on death row. He was exonerated after it was\ndiscovered that the assistant district attorney had concealed phone\nrecords proving he could not have committed the crimes.<br/><br/>Glenn Ford spent 29 years on death row after having been convicted\nof murder. He was exonerated after new evidence proved he was not\neven at the scene when the murder occurred. The attorneys assigned\nto represent him had never tried a jury case before.<br/><br/>Cameron Willingham was actually executed in 2004 by lethal injection.\nThe \"expert\" who testified that he deliberately set fire to his\nhouse has since been discredited. A re-examination of the case\nordered by the state of Texas in 2009 concluded that \"a finding of\narson could not be sustained.\"<br/><br/><a href=\"https://saverichardglossip.com/facts\"><u>Rich Glossip</u></a> \nhas spent 20 years on death row after being convicted\nof murder on the testimony of the actual killer, who escaped with\na life sentence in return for implicating him. In 2015 he came\nwithin minutes of execution before it emerged that Oklahoma had\nbeen planning to kill him with an illegal combination of drugs.\nThey still plan to go ahead with the execution, perhaps as soon as\nthis summer, despite \n<a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/oklahoma/articles/2020-10-14/attorney-for-oklahoma-death-row-inmate-claims-new-evidence\"><u>new \nevidence</u></a> exonerating him.<br/><br/>I could go on. There are hundreds of similar cases. In Florida\nalone, 29 death row prisoners have been exonerated so far.<br/><br/>Far from being rare, wrongful murder convictions are \n<a href=\"https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/policy-issues/innocence/description-of-innocence-cases\"><u>very common</u></a>.\nPolice are under pressure to solve a crime that has gotten a lot\nof attention. When they find a suspect, they want to believe he's\nguilty, and ignore or even destroy evidence suggesting otherwise.\nDistrict attorneys want to be seen as effective and tough on crime,\nand in order to win convictions are willing to manipulate witnesses\nand withhold evidence. Court-appointed defense attorneys are\noverworked and often incompetent. There's a ready supply of criminals\nwilling to give false testimony in return for a lighter sentence,\nsuggestible witnesses who can be made to say whatever police want,\nand bogus \"experts\" eager to claim that science proves the defendant\nis guilty. And juries want to believe them, since otherwise some\nterrible crime remains unsolved.<br/><br/>This circus of incompetence and dishonesty is the real issue with\nthe death penalty. We don't even reach the point where theoretical\nquestions about the moral justification or effectiveness of capital\npunishment start to matter, because so many of the people sentenced\nto death are actually innocent. Whatever it means in theory, in\npractice capital punishment means killing innocent people.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and Don Knight for\nreading drafts of this.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Related:</b><br/><br/></font>","date":"2021-04-01T00:00:00Z"}
