{"href":"mac.html","title":"Return of the Mac","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">March 2005<br/><br/>All the best <a href=\"gba.html\">hackers</a> \nI know are gradually switching to Macs.  My\nfriend Robert said his whole research group at MIT recently bought\nthemselves Powerbooks.  These guys are not the graphic designers\nand grandmas who were buying Macs at Apple's low point in the\nmid 1990s.  They're about as hardcore OS hackers as you can get.<br/><br/>The reason, of course, is OS X.  Powerbooks are beautifully designed\nand run FreeBSD.  What more do you need to know?<br/><br/>I got a Powerbook at the end of last year.   When my IBM Thinkpad's\nhard disk died soon after, it became my only laptop.  And when my\nfriend Trevor showed up at my house recently, he was carrying a\nPowerbook <a href=\"tlbmac.html\">identical</a> to mine.<br/><br/>For most of us, it's not a switch to Apple, but a return.  Hard as\nthis was to believe in the mid 90s, the Mac was in its time the\ncanonical hacker's computer.<br/><br/>In the fall of 1983,\nthe professor in one of my college CS classes got up and announced,\nlike a prophet, that there would soon be a computer with half a MIPS\nof processing power that would fit under an airline seat and cost\nso little that we could save enough to buy one from a summer job.\nThe whole room gasped.\nAnd when the Mac appeared, it was even better than we'd hoped.  It\nwas small and powerful and cheap, as promised.  But it was also\nsomething we'd never considered a computer could be: fabulously\nwell <a href=\"taste.html\">designed</a>.<br/><br/>I had to have one.  And I wasn't alone.  In the mid to late 1980s,\nall the hackers I knew were either writing software for the Mac,\nor wanted to.  Every futon sofa in Cambridge seemed to have the\nsame fat white book lying open on it.  If you turned it over, it\nsaid \"Inside Macintosh.\" <!-- in Apple Garamond. --><br/><br/>Then came Linux and FreeBSD, and hackers, who follow the most\npowerful OS wherever it leads, found themselves switching to Intel\nboxes.  If you cared about design, you could buy a Thinkpad, which\nwas at least not actively repellent, if you could get the Intel and\nMicrosoft <a href=\"designedforwindows.html\">stickers</a> \noff the front. [1]<br/><br/>With OS X, the hackers are back.  When I walked into the Apple store\nin Cambridge, it was like coming home.  Much\nwas changed, but there was still that Apple coolness in the air,\nthat feeling that the show was being run by someone who really\ncared, instead of random corporate deal-makers.<br/><br/>So what, the business world may say. Who cares if hackers like Apple\nagain?  How big is the hacker market, after all?<br/><br/>Quite small, but important out of proportion to its size.  When it\ncomes to computers, what hackers are doing now, everyone will be\ndoing in ten years.  Almost all technology, from Unix to bitmapped\ndisplays to the Web, became popular first within CS departments and\nresearch labs, and gradually spread to the rest of the world.<br/><br/>I remember telling my father back in 1986 that there was a new kind\nof computer called a Sun that was a serious Unix machine, but\nso small and cheap that you could\nhave one of your own to sit in front of, instead of sitting in front\nof a VT100 connected to a single central Vax.  Maybe, I suggested,\nhe should buy some stock in this company.  I think he really wishes\nhe'd listened.<br/><br/>In 1994 my friend Koling wanted to talk to his girlfriend in Taiwan,\nand to save long-distance bills he wrote some software that would  \nconvert sound to data packets that could be sent over the Internet.\nWe weren't sure at the time whether this was a proper use of the \nInternet, which was still then a quasi-government entity.  What he\nwas doing is now called VoIP, and it is a huge and rapidly growing\nbusiness.<br/><br/>If you want to know what ordinary people will be doing with computers\nin ten years, just walk around the CS department at a good university.\nWhatever they're doing, you'll be doing.<br/><br/>In the matter of \"platforms\" this tendency is even more pronounced,\nbecause novel software originates with \n<a href=\"gh.html\">great hackers</a>, and they tend\nto write it first for whatever computer they personally use.  And\nsoftware sells hardware.  Many if not most of the initial sales of\nthe Apple II came from people who bought one to run VisiCalc.  And\nwhy did Bricklin and Frankston write VisiCalc for the Apple II?\nBecause they personally liked it.  They could have chosen any machine\nto make into a star.<br/><br/>If you want to attract hackers to write software that will sell\nyour hardware, you have to make it something that they themselves\nuse.  It's not enough to make it \"open.\"  It has to be open and\ngood.<br/><br/>And open and good is what Macs are again, finally.  The intervening\nyears have created a situation that is, as far as I know, without\nprecedent: Apple is popular at the low end and the high end, but\nnot in the middle.  My seventy year old mother has a Mac laptop.\nMy friends with PhDs in computer science have Mac laptops. [2] And yet \nApple's overall market share is still small.<br/><br/>Though unprecedented, I predict this situation is also temporary.<br/><br/>So Dad, there's this company called Apple. They make a new kind of\ncomputer that's as well designed as a Bang &amp; Olufsen stereo system,\nand underneath is the best Unix machine you can buy.  Yes, the price\nto earnings ratio is kind of high, but I think a lot of people are\ngoing to want these.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[1] These horrible stickers are much like the intrusive ads popular\non pre-Google search engines.  They say to the customer: you are\nunimportant.  We care about Intel and Microsoft, not you.<br/><br/>[2] <a href=\"http://ycombinator.com\">Y Combinator</a>\nis (we hope) visited mostly by\nhackers.  The proportions of OSes are: \nWindows 66.4%, Macintosh 18.8%, Linux 11.4%, and FreeBSD 1.5%.\nThe Mac number is\na big change from what it would have been five years ago.<br/><br/><!--[These numbers are revised.  The original numbers overstated FreeBSD's\nmarket share because they included hits from us.]\n--><br/><br/></font>","date":"2005-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
