At least, that's how they\nsee it.<br/><br/>In fact consumers never really were paying for content, and publishers\nweren't really selling it either.  If the content was what they\nwere selling, why has the price of books or music or movies always\ndepended mostly on the format?  Why didn't better content cost more?\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/publishing.html#f1n\"><font color=\"#999999\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>A copy of <i>Time</i> costs $5 for 58 pages, or 8.6 cents a page.  \n<i>The Economist</i> costs $7 for 86 pages, or 8.1 cents a page.  Better\njournalism is actually slightly cheaper.<br/><br/>Almost every form of publishing has been organized as if the medium\nwas what they were selling, and the content was irrelevant.  Book\npublishers, for example, set prices based on the cost of producing\nand distributing books.  They treat the words printed in the book\nthe same way a textile manufacturer treats the patterns printed on\nits fabrics.<br/><br/>Economically, the print media are in the business of marking up\npaper.  We can all imagine an old-style editor getting a scoop and\nsaying \"this will sell a lot of papers!\" Cross out that final S and\nyou're describing their business model.  The reason they make less\nmoney now is that people don't need as much paper.<br/><br/>A few months ago I ran into a friend in a cafe.  I had a copy of\nthe <i>New York Times</i>, which I still occasionally buy on weekends.  As\nI was leaving I offered it to him, as I've done countless times\nbefore in the same situation.  But this time something new happened.\nI felt that sheepish feeling you get when you offer someone something\nworthless.  \"Do you, er, want a printout of yesterday's news?\" I\nasked.  (He didn't.)<br/><br/>Now that the medium is evaporating, publishers have nothing left\nto sell.  Some seem to think they're going to sell content—that\nthey were always in the content business, really.  But they weren't,\nand it's unclear whether anyone could be.<br/><br/><b>Selling</b><br/><br/>There have always been people in the business of selling information,\nbut that has historically been a distinct business from publishing.\nAnd the business of selling information to consumers has always\nbeen a marginal one.  When I was a kid there were people who used\nto sell newsletters containing stock tips, printed on colored paper\nthat made them hard for the copiers of the day to reproduce.  That\nis a different world, both culturally and economically, from the\none publishers currently inhabit.<br/><br/>People will pay for information they think they can make money from.\nThat's why they paid for those stock tip newsletters, and why\ncompanies pay now for Bloomberg terminals and Economist Intelligence\nUnit reports.  But will people pay for information otherwise?\nHistory offers little encouragement.<br/><br/>If audiences were willing to pay more for better content, why wasn't\nanyone already selling it to them?  There was no reason you couldn't\nhave done that in the era of physical media.  So were the print\nmedia and the music labels simply overlooking this opportunity?  Or\nis it, rather, nonexistent?<br/><br/>What about iTunes?  Doesn't that show people will pay for content?\nWell, not really. iTunes is more of a tollbooth than a store.  Apple\ncontrols the default path onto the iPod.  They offer a convenient\nlist of songs, and whenever you choose one they ding your credit\ncard for a small amount, just below the threshold of attention.\nBasically, iTunes makes money by taxing people, not selling them\nstuff.  You can only do that if you own the channel, and even then\nyou don't make much from it, because a toll has to be ignorable to\nwork.  Once a toll becomes painful, people start to find ways around\nit, and that's pretty easy with digital content.<br/><br/>The situation is much the same with digital books.  Whoever controls\nthe device sets the terms.  It's in their interest for content to\nbe as cheap as possible, and since they own the channel, there's a\nlot they can do to drive prices down.  Prices will fall even further\nonce writers realize they don't need publishers.  Getting a book\nprinted and distributed is a daunting prospect for a writer, but\nmost can upload a file.<br/><br/>Is software a counterexample?  People pay a lot for desktop software,\nand that's just information.  True, but I don't think publishers\ncan learn much from software.  Software companies can charge a lot\nbecause (a) many of the customers are businesses, who get in \n<a href=\"http://www.bsa.org/country/News%20and%20Events/News%20Archives/en/2009/en-08312009-mueller.aspx?sc_lang=en\">trouble</a>\nif they use pirated versions, and (b) though in form merely\ninformation, software is treated by both maker and purchaser as a\ndifferent type of thing from a song or an article.   A Photoshop\nuser needs Photoshop in a way that no one needs a particular song\nor article.<br/><br/>That's why there's a separate word, \"content,\" for information\nthat's not software.  Software is a different business.  Software\nand content blur together in some of the most lightweight software,\nlike casual games.  But those are usually free.   To make money the\nway software companies do, publishers would have to become software\ncompanies, and being publishers gives them no particular head start\nin that domain. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/publishing.html#f2n\"><font color=\"#999999\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The most promising countertrend is the premium cable channel.  People\nstill pay for those.  But broadcasting isn't publishing: you're not\nselling a copy of something.  That's one reason the movie business\nhasn't seen their revenues decline the way the news and music\nbusinesses have.  They only have one foot in publishing.<br/><br/>To the extent the movie business can avoid becoming publishers,\nthey may avoid publishing's problems.  But there are limits to how\nwell they'll be able to do that.  Once publishing—giving people\ncopies—becomes the most natural way of distributing your content,\nit probably doesn't work to stick to old forms of distribution just\nbecause you make more that way.  If free copies of your content are\navailable online, then you're competing with publishing's form of\ndistribution, and that's just as bad as being a publisher.<br/><br/>Apparently some people in the music business hope to retroactively\nconvert it away from publishing, by getting listeners to pay for\nsubscriptions.  It seems unlikely that will work if they're just\nstreaming the same files you can get as mp3s.<br/><br/><b>Next</b><br/><br/>What happens to publishing if you can't sell content?  You have two\nchoices: give it away and make money from it indirectly, or find\nways to embody it in things people will pay for.<br/><br/>The first is probably the future of most current media.  \n<a href=\"http://thesixtyone.com\">Give music\naway</a> and make money from concerts and t-shirts.  Publish articles\nfor free and make money from one of a dozen permutations of\nadvertising.  Both publishers and investors are down on advertising\nat the moment, but it has more potential than they realize.<br/><br/>I'm not claiming that potential will be realized by the existing\nplayers.  The <a href=\"http://ycombinator.com/rfs1.html\">optimal</a>\nways to make money from the written word\nprobably require different words written by different people.<br/><br/>It's harder to say what will happen to movies.  They could evolve\ninto ads.  Or they could return to their roots and make going to\nthe theater a treat.  If they made the experience good enough,\naudiences might start to prefer it to watching pirated movies at\nhome. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/publishing.html#f3n\"><font color=\"#999999\">3</font></a>]</font>\nOr maybe the movie business will dry up, and the people\nworking in it will go to work for game developers.<br/><br/>I don't know how big embodying information in physical form will\nbe.  It may be surprisingly large; people overvalue \n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/stuff.html\">physical stuff</a>.\nThere should remain some market for printed books, at least.<br/><br/>I can see the evolution of book publishing in the books on my\nshelves.  Clearly at some point in the 1960s the big publishing\nhouses started to ask: how cheaply can we make books before people\nrefuse to buy them?  The answer turned out to be one step short of\nphonebooks.  As long as it isn't floppy, consumers still perceive\nit as a book.<br/><br/>That worked as long as buying printed books was the only way to\nread them.  If printed books are optional, publishers will have to\nwork harder to entice people to buy them.  There should be some\nmarket, but it's hard to foresee how big, because its size will\ndepend not on macro trends like the amount people read, but on the\ningenuity of individual publishers. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/publishing.html#f4n\"><font color=\"#999999\">4</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Some magazines may thrive by focusing on the magazine as a physical\nobject.  Fashion magazines could be made lush in a way that would\nbe hard to match digitally, at least for a while.  But this is\nprobably not an option for most magazines.<br/><br/>I don't know exactly what the future will look like, but I'm not\ntoo worried about it.  This sort of change tends to create as many\ngood things as it kills.  Indeed, the really interesting question is not\nwhat will happen to existing forms, but what new forms will appear.<br/><br/>The reason I've been writing about existing forms is that I don't\n<i>know</i> what new forms will appear.  But though I can't predict\nspecific winners, I can offer a recipe for recognizing them.  When\nyou see something that's taking advantage of new technology to give\npeople something they want that they couldn't have before, you're\nprobably looking at a winner.  And when you see something that's\nmerely reacting to new technology in an attempt to preserve some\nexisting source of revenue, you're probably looking at a loser.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nI don't like the word \"content\" and tried for a while to avoid\nusing it, but I have to admit there's no other word that means the\nright thing.  \"Information\" is too general.<br/><br/>Ironically, the main reason I don't like \"content\" is the thesis\nof this essay.  The word suggests an undifferentiated slurry, but\neconomically that's how both publishers and audiences treat it.\nContent is information you don't need.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nSome types of publishers would be at a disadvantage trying\nto enter the software business.  Record labels, for example, would\nprobably find it more natural to expand into casinos than software,\nbecause the kind of people who run them would be more at home at\nthe mafia end of the business spectrum than the don't-be-evil end.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nI never watch movies in theaters anymore.  The tipping point\nfor me was the ads they show first.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f4n\"><font color=\"#000000\">4</font></a>]\nUnfortunately, making physically nice books will only be a\nniche within a niche.  Publishers are more likely to resort to\nexpedients like selling autographed copies, or editions with the\nbuyer's picture on the cover.<br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Michael Arrington, Trevor Blackwell, Steven Levy, Robert\nMorris, and Geoff Ralston for reading drafts of this.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2009-09-01T00:00:00Z"}
