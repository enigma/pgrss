{"href":"work.html","title":"What Doesn't Seem Like Work?","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">January 2015<br/><br/>My father is a mathematician. For most of my childhood he worked\nfor Westinghouse, modelling nuclear reactors.<br/><br/>He was one of those lucky people who know early on what they want to\ndo.  When you talk to him about his childhood, there's a clear\nwatershed at about age 12, when he \"got interested in maths.\"<br/><br/>He\ngrew up in the small Welsh seacoast town of <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/rkzUm\">Pwllheli</a>.  As we retraced\nhis walk to school on Google Street View, he said that it had been\nnice growing up in the country.<br/><br/>\"Didn't it get boring when you got to be about 15?\" I asked.<br/><br/>\"No,\" he said, \"by then I was interested in maths.\"<br/><br/>In another conversation he told me that what he really liked was\nsolving problems.  To me the exercises at the end of each chapter\nin a math textbook represent work, or at best a way to reinforce\nwhat you learned in that chapter.  To him the problems were the\nreward.  The text of each chapter was just some advice about solving\nthem. He said that as soon as he got a new textbook he'd immediately\nwork out all the problems â€” to the slight annoyance of his teacher,\nsince the class was supposed to work through the book gradually.<br/><br/>Few people know so early or so certainly what they want to work on.\nBut talking to my father reminded me of a heuristic the rest of us\ncan use. If something that seems like work to other people doesn't\nseem like work to you, that's something you're well suited for.\nFor example, a lot of programmers I know, including me, actually\nlike debugging.  It's not something people tend to volunteer; one\nlikes it the way one likes popping zits. But you may have to like\ndebugging to like programming, considering the degree to which\nprogramming consists of it.<br/><br/>The stranger your tastes seem to other people, the stronger evidence\nthey probably are of what you should do. When I was in college I\nused to write papers for my friends.  It was quite interesting to\nwrite a paper for a class I wasn't taking.  Plus they were always\nso relieved.<br/><br/>It seemed curious that the same task could be painful to one person\nand pleasant to another, but I didn't realize at the time what this\nimbalance implied, because I wasn't looking for it.  I didn't realize\nhow hard it can be to decide what you should work on, and that you\nsometimes have to <a href=\"love.html\">figure it out</a> from subtle clues, like a detective\nsolving a case in a mystery novel.  So I bet it would help a lot\nof people to ask themselves about this explicitly. What seems like\nwork to other people that doesn't seem like work to you?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston,\nRobert Morris, and my father for reading drafts of this.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
