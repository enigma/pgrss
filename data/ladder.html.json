{"href":"ladder.html","title":"After the Ladder","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">August 2005<br/><br/>Thirty years ago, one was supposed to work one's way up the corporate\nladder.  That's less the rule now.  Our generation wants to get\npaid up front.  Instead of developing a product for some big company\nin the expectation of getting job security in return, we develop\nthe product ourselves, in a startup, and sell it to the big company.\nAt the very least we want options.<br/><br/>Among other things, this shift has created the appearance of a rapid\nincrease in economic inequality.  But really the two cases are not\nas different as they look in economic statistics.<br/><br/>Economic statistics are misleading because they ignore the value\nof safe jobs.  An easy job from which one can't be fired is worth\nmoney; exchanging the two is one of the commonest forms of\ncorruption.  A sinecure is, in effect, an annuity.  Except sinecures\ndon't appear in economic statistics.  If they did, it would be clear\nthat in practice socialist countries have nontrivial disparities\nof wealth, because they usually have a class of powerful bureaucrats\nwho are paid mostly by seniority and can never be fired.<br/><br/>While not a sinecure, a position on the corporate ladder was genuinely\nvaluable, because big companies tried not to fire people, and\npromoted from within based largely on seniority.  A position on the\ncorporate ladder had a value analogous to the \"goodwill\" that is a\nvery real element in the valuation of companies.  It meant one could\nexpect future high paying jobs.<br/><br/>One of main causes of the decay of the corporate ladder is the trend\nfor takeovers that began in the 1980s.  Why waste your time climbing\na ladder that might disappear before you reach the top?<br/><br/>And, by no coincidence, the corporate ladder was one of the reasons\nthe early corporate raiders were so successful.  It's not only\neconomic statistics that ignore the value of safe jobs.  Corporate\nbalance sheets do too.  One reason it was profitable to carve up 1980s\ncompanies and sell them for parts was that they hadn't formally\nacknowledged their implicit debt to employees who had done good\nwork and expected to be rewarded with high-paying executive jobs\nwhen their time came.<br/><br/>In the movie <i>Wall Street</i>, Gordon Gekko\nridicules a company overloaded with vice presidents.  But the company\nmay not be as corrupt as it seems; those VPs' cushy jobs were\nprobably payment for work done earlier.<br/><br/>I like the new model better.  For one thing, it seems a bad plan\nto treat jobs as rewards.  Plenty of good engineers got made into\nbad managers that way.  And the old system meant people had to deal\nwith a lot more corporate politics, in order to protect the work\nthey'd invested in a position on the ladder.<br/><br/>The big disadvantage of the new system is that it involves more <a href=\"inequality.html\">risk</a>.  If you develop ideas in a startup instead\nof within a big company, any number of random factors could sink\nyou before you can finish.  But maybe the older generation would\nlaugh at me for saying that the way we do things is riskier.  After\nall, projects within big companies were always getting cancelled\nas a result of arbitrary decisions from higher up.  My father's\nentire industry (breeder reactors) disappeared that way.<br/><br/>For better or worse, the idea of the corporate ladder is probably\ngone for good.  The new model seems more liquid, and more efficient.\nBut it is less of a change, financially, than one might think.  Our\nfathers weren't <i>that</i> stupid.<br/><br/><br/><br><br/></br></font>","date":"2005-08-01T00:00:00Z"}
