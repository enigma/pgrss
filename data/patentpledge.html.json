{"href":"patentpledge.html","title":"The Patent Pledge","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">August 2011<br/><br/>I realized recently that we may be able to solve part of the patent\nproblem without waiting for the government.<br/><br/>I've never been 100% sure whether patents help or hinder technological\nprogress.  When I was a kid I thought they helped.  I thought they\nprotected inventors from having their ideas stolen by big companies.\nMaybe that was truer in the past, when more things were physical.\nBut regardless of whether patents are in general a good thing, there\ndo seem to be bad ways of using them.  And since bad uses of patents\nseem to be increasing, there is an increasing call for patent reform.<br/><br/>The problem with patent reform is that it has to go through the\ngovernment.  That tends to be slow.  But recently I realized we can\nalso attack the problem downstream.  As well as pinching off the\nstream of patents at the point where they're issued, we may in some\ncases be able to pinch it off at the point where they're used.<br/><br/>One way of using patents that clearly does not encourage innovation\nis when established companies with bad products use patents to\nsuppress small competitors with good products.  This is the type\nof abuse we may be able to decrease without having to go through\nthe government.<br/><br/>The way to do it is to get the companies that are above pulling\nthis sort of trick to pledge publicly not to.  Then the ones that\nwon't make such a pledge will be very conspicuous.  Potential\nemployees won't want to work for them.  And investors, too, will\nbe able to see that they're the sort of company that competes by\nlitigation rather than by making good products.<br/><br/>Here's the pledge:\n<blockquote>\n    No first use of software patents against companies with less \n    than 25 people.\n</blockquote>\nI've deliberately traded precision for brevity.  The patent pledge\nis not legally binding.  It's like Google's \"Don't be evil.\" They\ndon't define what evil is, but by publicly saying that, they're\nsaying they're willing to be held to a standard that, say, Altria\nis not.  And though constraining, \"Don't be evil\" has been good for\nGoogle. Technology companies win by attracting the most productive\npeople, and the most productive people are attracted to employers\nwho hold themselves to a higher standard than the law requires.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/patentpledge.html#f1n\"><font color=\"#999999\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The patent pledge is in effect a narrower but open source \"Don't\nbe evil.\"  I encourage every technology company to adopt it.  If\nyou want to help fix patents, encourage your employer to.<br/><br/>Already most technology companies wouldn't sink to using patents\non startups.  You don't see Google or Facebook suing startups for\npatent infringement. They don't need to.  So for the better technology\ncompanies, the patent pledge requires no change in behavior.  They're\njust promising to do what they'd do anyway.  And when all the\ncompanies that won't use patents on startups have said so, the\nholdouts will be very conspicuous.<br/><br/>The patent pledge doesn't fix every problem with patents.  It won't\nstop patent trolls, for example; they're already pariahs.  But the\nproblem the patent pledge does fix may be more serious than the\nproblem of patent trolls.  Patent trolls are just parasites.  A\nclumsy parasite may occasionally kill the host, but that's not its\ngoal.  Whereas companies that sue startups for patent infringement\ngenerally do it with explicit goal of keeping their product off the\nmarket.<br/><br/>Companies that use patents on startups are attacking innovation at\nthe root.  Now there's something any individual can do about this\nproblem, without waiting for the government: ask companies where\nthey stand.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://thepatentpledge.org\">Patent Pledge Site</a><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Notes:</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nBecause the pledge is deliberately vague, we're going to need\ncommon sense when intepreting it.  And even more vice versa: the\npledge is vague in order to make people use common sense when\ninterpreting it.<br/><br/>So for example I've deliberately avoided saying whether the 25\npeople have to be employees, or whether contractors count too.  If\na company has to split hairs that fine about whether a suit would\nviolate the patent pledge, it's probably still a dick move.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2011-08-01T00:00:00Z"}
