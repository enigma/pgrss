{"href":"colleges.html","title":"News from the Front","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">September 2007<br/><br/>A few weeks ago I had a thought so heretical that it really surprised\nme. It may not matter all that much where you go to college.<br/><br/>For me, as for a lot of middle class kids, getting into a good\ncollege was more or less the meaning of life when I was growing up.\nWhat was I?  A student.  To do that well meant to get good grades.\nWhy did one have to get good grades?  To get into a good college.\nAnd why did one want to do that?  There seemed to be several reasons:\nyou'd learn more, get better jobs, make more money.  But it didn't\nmatter exactly what the benefits would be.  College was a bottleneck\nthrough which all your future prospects passed; everything would\nbe better if you went to a better college.<br/><br/>A few weeks ago I realized that somewhere along the line I had\nstopped believing that.<br/><br/>What first set me thinking about this was the new trend of worrying\nobsessively about what \n<a href=\"http://nymag.com/nymetro/urban/education/features/15141/\">kindergarten</a>\nyour kids go to.  It seemed to\nme this couldn't possibly matter.  Either it won't help your kid\nget into Harvard, or if it does, getting into Harvard won't mean\nmuch anymore.  And then I thought: how much does it mean even now?<br/><br/>It turns out I have a lot of data about that.  My three partners\nand I run a seed stage investment firm called \n<a href=\"http://ycombinator.com\">Y Combinator</a>.  We\ninvest when the company is just a couple guys and an idea.  The\nidea doesn't matter much; it will change anyway.  Most of our\ndecision is based on the founders.  The average founder is three\nyears out of college.  Many have just graduated; a few are still\nin school.  So we're in much the same position as a graduate program,\nor a company hiring people right out of college.  Except our choices\nare immediately and visibly tested.  There are two possible outcomes\nfor a startup: success or failure—and usually you know within a\nyear which it will be.<br/><br/>The test applied to a startup is among the purest of real world\ntests.  A startup succeeds or fails depending almost entirely on\nthe efforts of the founders.  Success is decided by the market: you\nonly succeed if users like what you've built.  And users don't care\nwhere you went to college.<br/><br/>As well as having precisely measurable results, we have a lot of\nthem.  Instead of doing a small number of large deals like a\ntraditional venture capital fund, we do a large number of small\nones.  We currently fund about 40 companies a year, selected from\nabout 900 applications representing a total of about 2000 people. \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/colleges.html#f1n\"><font color=\"#777777\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Between the volume of people we judge and the rapid, unequivocal\ntest that's applied to our choices, Y Combinator has been an\nunprecedented opportunity for learning how to pick winners.  One\nof the most surprising things we've learned is how little it matters\nwhere people went to college.<br/><br/>I thought I'd already been cured of caring about that.  There's\nnothing like going to grad school at Harvard to cure you of any\nillusions you might have about the average Harvard undergrad.  And\nyet Y Combinator showed us we were still overestimating people who'd\nbeen to elite colleges.  We'd interview people from MIT or Harvard\nor Stanford and sometimes find ourselves thinking: they <i>must</i> be\nsmarter than they seem.  It took us a few iterations to learn to\ntrust our senses.<br/><br/>Practically everyone thinks that someone who went to MIT or Harvard\nor Stanford must be smart.  Even people who hate you for it believe\nit.<br/><br/>But when you think about what it means to have gone to an elite\ncollege, how could this be true?   We're talking about a decision\nmade by admissions officers—basically, HR people—based on a\ncursory examination of a huge pile of depressingly similar applications\nsubmitted by seventeen year olds.  And what do they have to go on?\nAn easily gamed standardized test; a short essay telling you what\nthe kid thinks you want to hear; an interview with a random alum;\na high school record that's largely an index of obedience.  Who\nwould rely on such a test?<br/><br/>And yet a lot of companies do.  A lot of companies are very much\ninfluenced by where applicants went to college.  How could they be?\nI think I know the answer to that.<br/><br/>There used to be a saying in the corporate world: \"No one ever got\nfired for buying IBM.\"  You no longer hear this about IBM specifically,\nbut the idea is very much alive; there is a whole category of\n\"enterprise\" software companies that exist to take advantage of it.\nPeople buying technology for large organizations don't care if they\npay a fortune for mediocre software.  It's not their money.  They\njust want to buy from a supplier who seems safe—a company with\nan established name, confident salesmen, impressive offices, and\nsoftware that conforms to all the current fashions.  Not necessarily\na company that will deliver so much as one that, if they do let you\ndown, will still seem to have been a prudent choice.  So companies\nhave evolved to fill that niche.<br/><br/>A recruiter at a big company is in much the same position as someone\nbuying technology for one.  If someone went to Stanford and is not\nobviously insane, they're probably a safe bet.  And a safe bet is\nenough.  No one ever measures recruiters by the later performance\nof people they turn down. \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/colleges.html#f2n\"><font color=\"#777777\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>I'm not saying, of course, that elite colleges have evolved to prey\nupon the weaknesses of large organizations the way enterprise\nsoftware companies have.  But they work as if they had.  In addition\nto the power of the brand name, graduates of elite colleges have\ntwo critical qualities that plug right into the way large organizations\nwork.  They're good at doing what they're asked, since that's what\nit takes to please the adults who judge you at seventeen.  And\nhaving been to an elite college makes them more confident.<br/><br/>Back in the days when people might spend their whole career at one\nbig company, these qualities must have been very valuable.  Graduates\nof elite colleges would have been capable, yet amenable to authority.\nAnd since individual performance is so hard to measure in large\norganizations, their own confidence would have been the starting\npoint for their reputation.<br/><br/>Things are very different in the new world of startups.  We couldn't\nsave someone from the market's judgement even if we wanted to.  And\nbeing charming and confident counts for nothing with users.  All\nusers care about is whether you make something they like.  If you\ndon't, you're dead.<br/><br/>Knowing that test is coming makes us work a lot harder to get the\nright answers than anyone would if they were merely hiring people.\nWe can't afford to have any illusions about the predictors of\nsuccess.  And what we've found is that the variation between schools\nis so much smaller than the variation between individuals that it's\nnegligible by comparison.  We can learn more about someone in the\nfirst minute of talking to them than by knowing where they went to\nschool.<br/><br/>It seems obvious when you put it that way.  Look at the individual,\nnot where they went to college.  But that's a weaker statement than\nthe idea I began with, that it doesn't matter much where a given\nindividual goes to college.  Don't you learn things at the best\nschools that you wouldn't learn at lesser places?<br/><br/>Apparently not.  Obviously you can't prove this in the case of a\nsingle individual, but you can tell from aggregate evidence: you\ncan't, without asking them, distinguish people who went to one\nschool from those who went to another three times as far down the\n<i>US News</i> list. \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/colleges.html#f3n\"><font color=\"#777777\">3</font></a>]</font>\nTry it and see.<br/><br/>How can this be?  Because how much you learn in college depends a\nlot more on you than the college.  A determined party animal can\nget through the best school without learning anything.  And someone\nwith a real thirst for knowledge will be able to find a few smart\npeople to learn from at a school that isn't prestigious at all.<br/><br/>\nThe other students are the biggest advantage of going to an elite\ncollege; you learn more from them than the professors.  But\nyou should be able to reproduce this at most colleges if you make\na conscious effort to find smart friends.  At\nmost colleges you can find at least a handful of other smart students,\nand most people have only a handful of close friends in college\nanyway. \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/colleges.html#f4n\"><font color=\"#777777\">4</font></a>]</font>\nThe odds of finding smart professors are even better.\nThe curve for faculty is a lot flatter than for students, especially\nin math and the hard sciences; you have to go pretty far down the\nlist of colleges before you stop finding smart professors in the\nmath department.<br/><br/>So it's not surprising that we've found the relative prestige of\ndifferent colleges useless in judging individuals.  There's a lot\nof randomness in how colleges select people, and what they learn\nthere depends much more on them than the college.  Between these\ntwo sources of variation, the college someone went to doesn't mean\na lot.  It is to some degree a predictor of ability, but so weak\nthat we regard it mainly as a source of error and try consciously\nto ignore it.<br/><br/>I doubt what we've discovered is an anomaly specific to startups.\nProbably people have always overestimated the importance of where\none goes to college.  We're just finally able to measure it.<br/><br/>The unfortunate thing is not just that people are judged by such a\nsuperficial test, but that so many judge themselves by it.  A lot\nof people, probably the majority of people in America, have\nsome amount of insecurity about where, or whether, they went to\ncollege.  The tragedy of the situation is that by far the greatest\nliability of not having gone to the college you'd have liked is\nyour own feeling that you're thereby lacking something.  Colleges\nare a bit like exclusive clubs in this respect.  There is only one\nreal advantage to being a member of most exclusive clubs: you know\nyou wouldn't be missing much if you weren't.  When you're excluded,\nyou can only imagine the advantages of being an insider.  But\ninvariably they're larger in your imagination than in real life.<br/><br/>So it is with colleges.  Colleges differ, but they're nothing like\nthe stamp of destiny so many imagine them to be.  People aren't\nwhat some admissions officer decides about them at seventeen.\nThey're what they make themselves.<br/><br/>Indeed, the great advantage of not caring where people went to\ncollege is not just that you can stop judging them (and yourself)\nby superficial measures, but that you can focus instead on what\nreally matters.  What matters is what you make of yourself.  \nI think that's what we\nshould tell kids.  Their job isn't to get good grades so they can\nget into a good college, but to learn and do.  And not just because\nthat's more rewarding than worldly success.  That will increasingly\n<i>be</i> the route to worldly success.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>] \nIs what we measure worth measuring?  I think so.  You can get\nrich simply by being energetic and unscrupulous, but getting rich\nfrom a technology startup takes some amount of brains.   It is just\nthe kind of work the upper middle class values; it has about the\nsame intellectual component as being a doctor.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>] \nActually, someone did, once.  Mitch Kapor's wife Freada was\nin charge of HR at Lotus in the early years.  (As he is at pains\nto point out, they did not become romantically involved till\nafterward.)  At one point they worried Lotus was losing its startup\nedge and turning into a big company.  So as an experiment she sent\ntheir recruiters the resumes of the first 40 employees, with\nidentifying details changed.  These were the people who had made\nLotus into the star it was.  Not one got an interview.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>] \nThe <i>US News</i> list?  Surely no one trusts that.  Even if the\nstatistics they consider are useful, how do they decide on the\nrelative weights?  The reason the <i>US News</i> list is meaningful is\nprecisely because they are so intellectually dishonest in that\nrespect.  There is no external source they can use to calibrate the\nweighting of the statistics they use; if there were, we could just\nuse that instead.  What they must do is adjust the weights till the\ntop schools are the usual suspects in about the right order.  So\nin effect what the <i>US News</i> list tells us is what the editors think\nthe top schools are, which is probably not far from the conventional\nwisdom on the matter.  The amusing thing is, because some schools\nwork hard to game the system, the editors will have to keep tweaking\ntheir algorithm to get the rankings they want.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f4n\"><font color=\"#000000\">4</font></a>] \nPossible doesn't mean easy, of course.  A smart student at a party school\nwill inevitably be something of an outcast, just as he or\nshe would be in most <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/nerds.html\">high schools</a>.<br/><br/>\n<b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica Livingston, Jackie\nMcDonough, Peter Norvig, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of\nthis.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2007-09-01T00:00:00Z"}
