{"href":"prcmc.html","title":"The Pooled-Risk Company Management Company","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">July 2008<br/><br/>At this year's startup school, David Heinemeier Hansson gave a\n <a href=\"http://www.omnisio.com/startupschool08/david-heinemeier-hansson-at-startup-school-08\">talk</a>\nin which he suggested that startup founders\nshould do things the old fashioned way.  Instead of hoping to get\nrich by building a valuable company and then selling stock in a\n\"liquidity event,\" founders should start companies that make money\nand live off the revenues.<br/><br/>Sounds like a good plan.  Let's think about the optimal way to do\nthis.<br/><br/>One disadvantage of living off the revenues of your company is that\nyou have to keep running it.  And as anyone who runs their own\nbusiness can tell you, that requires your complete attention.  You\ncan't just start a business and check out once things are going\nwell, or they stop going well surprisingly fast.<br/><br/>The main economic motives of startup founders seem to be freedom\nand security.  They want enough money that (a) they don't have to\nworry about running out of money and (b) they can spend their time\nhow they want.  Running your own business offers neither.  You\ncertainly don't have freedom: no boss is so demanding.  Nor do you\nhave security, because if you stop paying attention to the company,\nits revenues go away, and with them your income.<br/><br/>The best case, for most people, would be if you could hire someone\nto manage the company for you once you'd grown it to a certain size.\nSuppose you could find a really good manager.  Then you would have\nboth freedom and security.  You could pay as little attention to\nthe business as you wanted, knowing that your manager would keep\nthings running smoothly.  And that being so, revenues would continue\nto flow in, so you'd have security as well.<br/><br/>There will of course be some founders who wouldn't like that idea:\nthe ones who like running their company so much that there's nothing\nelse they'd rather do.  But this group must be small.  The way you\nsucceed in most businesses is to be fanatically attentive\nto customers' needs.  What are the odds that your own desires would\ncoincide exactly with the demands of this powerful, external force?<br/><br/>Sure, running your own company can be fairly interesting.  Viaweb\nwas more interesting than any job I'd had before.  And since I made\nmuch more money from it, it offered the highest ratio of income to\nboringness of anything I'd done, by orders of magnitude.  But was\nit <i>the</i> most interesting work I could imagine doing?  No.<br/><br/>Whether the number of founders in the same position is asymptotic\nor merely large, there are certainly a lot of them.  For them the\nright approach would be to hand the company over to a professional\nmanager eventually, if they could find one who was good enough.<br/><br/><center>_____</center><br/><br/>So far so good.  But what if your manager was hit by a bus?  What\nyou really want is a management company to run your company for\nyou.  Then you don't depend on any one person.<br/><br/>If you own rental property, there are companies you can hire to\nmanage it for you.  Some will do everything, from finding tenants\nto fixing leaks.  Of course, running companies is a lot more\ncomplicated than managing rental property, but let's suppose there\nwere management companies that could do it for you. They'd charge\na lot, but wouldn't it be worth it?  I'd sacrifice a large percentage\nof the income for the extra peace of mind.<br/><br/>I realize what I'm describing already sounds too good to be true, but I\ncan think of a way to make it even more attractive.  If\ncompany management companies existed, there would be an additional\nservice they could offer clients: they could let them insure their\nreturns by pooling their risk.  After all, even a perfect manager can't save a company\nwhen, as sometimes happens, its whole market dies, just as property\nmanagers can't save you from the building burning down.  But a\ncompany that managed a large enough number of companies could say\nto all its clients: we'll combine the revenues from all your\ncompanies, and pay you your proportionate share.<br/><br/>If such management companies existed, they'd offer the maximum of\nfreedom and security.  Someone would run your company for you, and\nyou'd be protected even if it happened to die.<br/><br/>Let's think about how such a management company might be organized.\nThe simplest way would be to have a new kind of stock representing\nthe total pool of companies they were managing.  When you signed\nup, you'd trade your company's stock for shares of this pool, in\nproportion to an estimate of your company's value that you'd both\nagreed upon.  Then you'd automatically get your share of the returns\nof the whole pool.<br/><br/>The catch is that because this kind of trade would be hard to undo,\nyou couldn't switch management companies.  But there's a way they\ncould fix that: suppose all the company management companies got\ntogether and agreed to allow their clients to exchange shares in\nall their pools.  Then you could, in effect, simultaneously choose\nall the management companies to run yours for you, in whatever\nproportion you wanted, and change your mind later as often as you\nwanted.<br/><br/>If such pooled-risk company management companies existed, signing\nup with one would seem the ideal plan for most people following the\nroute David advocated.<br/><br/>Good news: they do exist.  What I've just\ndescribed is an acquisition by a public company.<br/><br/><center>_____</center><br/><br/>Unfortunately, though public acquirers are structurally identical\nto pooled-risk company management companies, they don't think of\nthemselves that way.  With a property management company, you can\njust walk in whenever you want and say \"manage my rental property\nfor me\" and they'll do it.  Whereas acquirers are, as of this\nwriting, extremely fickle.  Sometimes they're in a buying mood and\nthey'll overpay enormously; other times they're not interested.\nThey're like property management companies run by madmen.  Or more\nprecisely, by Benjamin Graham's Mr. Market.<br/><br/>So while on average public acquirers behave like pooled-risk company\nmanagers, you need a window of several years to get average case\nperformance.  If you wait long enough (five years, say) you're\nlikely to hit an up cycle where some acquirer is hot to buy you.\nBut you can't choose when it happens.<br/><br/>You can't assume investors will carry you for as long as you might\nhave to wait. Your company has to make money.  Opinions are divided\nabout how early to focus on that.  \n<a href=\"http://susanitsa.wordpress.com/2006/11/08/the-joe-kraus-qa-better-late/\">Joe Kraus</a> says you should try\ncharging customers right away.  And yet some of the most successful\nstartups, including Google, ignored revenue at first and concentrated\nexclusively on development.  The answer probably depends on the\ntype of company you're starting.  I can imagine some where trying\nto make sales would be a good heuristic for product design, and\nothers where it would just be a distraction.  The test is probably\nwhether it helps you to understand your users.<br/><br/>You can choose whichever revenue strategy you think is best for the\ntype of company you're starting, so long as you're profitable.\nBeing profitable ensures you'll get at least the average of the\nacquisition marketâ€”in which public companies do behave as pooled-risk\ncompany management companies.<br/><br/>David isn't mistaken in saying you should start a company to live\noff its revenues.  The mistake is thinking this is somehow opposed\nto starting a company and selling it.  In fact, for most people the\nlatter is merely the optimal case of the former.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, Michael\nMandel, Robert Morris, and Fred Wilson for reading drafts of this.<br/><br/>\n<!--\nhttp://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=254335\"\n--><br/><br/></font>","date":"2008-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
