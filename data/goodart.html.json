{"href":"goodart.html","title":"How Art Can Be Good","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">December 2006<br/><br/>I grew up believing that taste is just a matter of personal preference.\nEach person has things they like, but no one's preferences are any\nbetter than anyone else's.  There is no such thing as <i>good</i> taste.<br/><br/>Like a lot of things I grew up believing, this turns out to be\nfalse, and I'm going to try to explain why.<br/><br/>One problem with saying there's no such thing as good taste is that\nit also means there's no such thing as good art.  If there were\ngood art, then people who liked it would have better taste than\npeople who didn't.  So if you discard taste, you also have to discard\nthe idea of art being good, and artists being good at making it.<br/><br/>It was pulling on that thread that unravelled my childhood faith\nin relativism.  When you're trying to make things, taste becomes a\npractical matter.  You have to decide what to do next.  Would it\nmake the painting better if I changed that part?  If there's no\nsuch thing as better, it doesn't matter what you do.  In fact, it\ndoesn't matter if you paint at all.  You could just go out and buy\na ready-made blank canvas.  If there's no such thing as good, that\nwould be just as great an achievement as the ceiling of the Sistine\nChapel.  Less laborious, certainly, but if you can achieve the same\nlevel of performance with less effort, surely that's more impressive,\nnot less.<br/><br/>Yet that doesn't seem quite right, does it?<br/><br/><b>Audience</b><br/><br/>I think the key to this puzzle is to remember that art has an\naudience.  Art has a purpose, which is to interest its audience.\nGood art (like good anything) is art that achieves its purpose\nparticularly well.  The meaning of \"interest\" can vary.  Some works\nof art are meant to shock, and others to please; some are meant to\njump out at you, and others to sit quietly in the background. But\nall art has to work on an audience, and—here's the critical \npoint—members of the audience share things in common.<br/><br/>For example, nearly all humans find human faces engaging.  It seems\nto be wired into us.  Babies can recognize faces practically from\nbirth.  In fact, faces seem to have co-evolved with our interest\nin them; the face is the body's billboard.  So all other things\nbeing equal, a painting with faces in it will interest people more\nthan one without. \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/goodart.html#f1n\"><font color=\"#777777\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>One reason it's easy to believe that taste is merely personal\npreference is that, if it isn't, how do you pick out the people\nwith better taste?  There are billions of people, each with their\nown opinion; on what grounds can you prefer one to another?\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/goodart.html#f2n\"><font color=\"#777777\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>But if audiences have a lot in common, you're not in a position of\nhaving to choose one out of a random set of individual biases,\nbecause the set isn't random.  All humans find faces \nengaging—practically by definition: face recognition is \nin our DNA.  And so\nhaving a notion of good art, in the sense of art that does its job\nwell, doesn't require you to pick out a few individuals and label\ntheir opinions as correct.  No matter who you pick, they'll find\nfaces engaging.<br/><br/>Of course, space aliens probably wouldn't find human faces engaging.\nBut there might be other things they shared in common with us.  The\nmost likely source of examples is math.  I expect space aliens would\nagree with us most of the time about which of two proofs was better.\nErdos thought so.  He called a maximally elegant proof one out of\nGod's book, and presumably God's book is universal.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/goodart.html#f3n\"><font color=\"#777777\">3</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Once you start talking about audiences, you don't have to argue\nsimply that there are or aren't standards of taste.  Instead tastes\nare a series of concentric rings, like ripples in a pond.  There\nare some things that will appeal to you and your friends, others\nthat will appeal to most people your age, others that will appeal\nto most humans, and perhaps others that would appeal to most sentient\nbeings (whatever that means).<br/><br/>The picture is slightly more complicated than that, because in the\nmiddle of the pond there are overlapping sets of ripples.  For\nexample, there might be things that appealed particularly to men,\nor to people from a certain culture.<br/><br/>If good art is art that interests its audience, then when you talk\nabout art being good, you also have to say for what audience.  So\nis it meaningless to talk about art simply being good or bad?  No,\nbecause one audience is the set of all possible humans.  I think\nthat's the audience people are implicitly talking about when they\nsay a work of art is good: they mean it would engage any human.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/goodart.html#f4n\"><font color=\"#777777\">4</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>And that is a meaningful test, because although, like any everyday\nconcept, \"human\" is fuzzy around the edges, there are a lot of\nthings practically all humans have in common.  In addition to our\ninterest in faces, there's something special about primary colors\nfor nearly all of us, because it's an artifact of the way our eyes\nwork.  Most humans will also find images of 3D objects engaging,\nbecause that also seems to be built into our visual perception.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/goodart.html#f5n\"><font color=\"#777777\">5</font></a>]</font>\nAnd beneath that there's edge-finding, which makes images\nwith definite shapes more engaging than mere blur.<br/><br/>Humans have a lot more in common than this, of course.  My goal is\nnot to compile a complete list, just to show that there's some solid\nground here.  People's preferences aren't random.  So an artist\nworking on a painting and trying to decide whether to change some\npart of it doesn't have to think \"Why bother?  I might as well flip\na coin.\" Instead he can ask \"What would make the painting more\ninteresting to people?\"  And the reason you can't equal Michelangelo\nby going out and buying a blank canvas is that the ceiling of the\nSistine Chapel is more interesting to people.<br/><br/>A lot of philosophers have had a hard time believing it was possible\nfor there to be objective standards for art. It seemed obvious that\nbeauty, for example, was something that happened in the head of the observer,\nnot something that was a property of objects.  It was thus \n\"subjective\" rather than \"objective.\"  But in fact if you narrow the\ndefinition of beauty to something that works a certain way on\nhumans, and you observe how much humans have in common, it turns out\nto be a property of objects after all.   You don't\nhave to choose between something being a property of the   \nsubject or the object if subjects all react similarly.\nBeing good art is thus a property of objects as much as, say, being\ntoxic to humans is: it's good art if it consistently affects humans \nin a certain way.<br/><br/>\n<b>Error</b><br/><br/>So could we figure out what the best art is by taking a vote?  After\nall, if appealing to humans is the test, we should be able to just\nask them, right?<br/><br/>Well, not quite.  For products of nature that might work.  I'd be\nwilling to eat the apple the world's population had voted most\ndelicious, and I'd probably be willing to visit the beach they voted\nmost beautiful, but having to look at the painting they voted the\nbest would be a crapshoot.<br/><br/>Man-made stuff is different.  For one thing, artists, unlike apple\ntrees, often deliberately try to trick us.  Some tricks are quite\nsubtle.  For example, any work of art sets expectations by its level\nof finish.  You don't expect photographic accuracy in something\nthat looks like a quick sketch.  So one widely used trick, especially\namong illustrators, is to intentionally make a painting or drawing\nlook like it was done faster than it was.  The average person looks\nat it and thinks: how amazingly skillful.  It's like saying something\nclever in a conversation as if you'd thought of it on the spur of\nthe moment, when in fact you'd worked it out the day before.<br/><br/>Another much less subtle influence is brand.  If you go to see the\nMona Lisa, you'll probably be disappointed, because it's hidden\nbehind a thick glass wall and surrounded by a frenzied crowd taking\npictures of themselves in front of it.  At best you can see it the\nway you see a friend across the room at a crowded party.  The Louvre\nmight as well replace it with copy; no one would be able to tell.\nAnd yet the Mona Lisa is a small, dark painting.  If you found\npeople who'd never seen an image of it and sent them to a museum\nin which it was hanging among other paintings with a tag labelling\nit as a portrait by an unknown fifteenth century artist, most would\nwalk by without giving it a second look.<br/><br/>For the average person, brand dominates all other factors in the\njudgement of art.  Seeing a painting they recognize from reproductions\nis so overwhelming that their response to it as a painting is drowned\nout.<br/><br/>And then of course there are the tricks people play on themselves.\nMost adults looking at art worry that if they don't like what they're\nsupposed to, they'll be thought uncultured.  This doesn't just\naffect what they claim to like; they actually make themselves like\nthings they're supposed to.<br/><br/>That's why you can't just take a vote.  Though appeal to people is\na meaningful test, in practice you can't measure it, just as you\ncan't find north using a compass with a magnet sitting next to it.\nThere are sources of error so powerful that if you take a vote, all\nyou're measuring is the error.<br/><br/>We can, however, approach our goal from another direction, by using\nourselves as guinea pigs.  You're human.  If you want to know what\nthe basic human reaction to a piece of art would be, you can at\nleast approach that by getting rid of the sources of error in your\nown judgements.<br/><br/>For example, while anyone's reaction to a famous painting will be\nwarped at first by its fame, there are ways to decrease its effects.\nOne is to come back to the painting over and over.  After a few\ndays the fame wears off, and you can start to see it as a painting.\nAnother is to stand close.  A painting familiar from reproductions\nlooks more familiar from ten feet away; close in you see details\nthat get lost in reproductions, and which you're therefore seeing\nfor the first time.<br/><br/>There are two main kinds of error that get in the way of seeing a\nwork of art: biases you bring from your own circumstances, and\ntricks played by the artist.  Tricks are straightforward to correct\nfor. Merely being aware of them usually prevents them from working.\nFor example, when I was ten I used to be very impressed by airbrushed\nlettering that looked like shiny metal.  But once you study how\nit's done, you see that it's a pretty cheesy trick—one of the\nsort that relies on pushing a few visual buttons really hard to\ntemporarily overwhelm the viewer.  It's like trying to convince\nsomeone by shouting at them.<br/><br/>The way not to be vulnerable to tricks is to explicitly seek out\nand catalog them.  When you notice a whiff of dishonesty coming\nfrom some kind of art, stop and figure out what's going on.  When\nsomeone is obviously pandering to an audience that's easily fooled,\nwhether it's someone making shiny stuff to impress ten year olds,\nor someone making conspicuously avant-garde stuff to impress would-be\nintellectuals, learn how they do it.  Once you've seen enough\nexamples of specific types of tricks, you start to become a connoisseur\nof trickery in general, just as professional magicians are.<br/><br/>What counts as a trick?  Roughly, it's something done with contempt\nfor the audience.  For example, the guys designing Ferraris in the\n1950s were probably designing cars that they themselves admired.\nWhereas I suspect over at General Motors the marketing people are\ntelling the designers, \"Most people who buy SUVs do it to seem\nmanly, not to drive off-road. So don't worry about the suspension;\njust make that sucker as big and tough-looking as you can.\" \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/goodart.html#f6n\"><font color=\"#777777\">6</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>I think with some effort you can make yourself nearly immune to\ntricks.  It's harder to escape the influence of your own circumstances,\nbut you can at least move in that direction.  The way to do it is\nto travel widely, in both time and space.  If you go and see all\nthe different kinds of things people like in other cultures, and\nlearn about all the different things people have liked in the past,\nyou'll probably find it changes what you like.  I doubt you could\never make yourself into a completely universal person, if only\nbecause you can only travel in one direction in time.  But if you\nfind a work of art that would appeal equally to your friends, to\npeople in Nepal, and to the ancient Greeks, you're probably onto\nsomething.<br/><br/>My main point here is not how to have good taste, but that there\ncan even be such a thing.  And I think I've shown that.  There is\nsuch a thing as good art. It's art that interests its human audience,\nand since humans have a lot in common, what interests them is not\nrandom.  Since there's such a thing as good art, there's\nalso such a thing as good taste, which is the ability to recognize\nit.<br/><br/>If we were talking about the taste of apples, I'd agree that taste\nis just personal preference.  Some people like certain kinds of\napples and others like other kinds, but how can you say that one\nis right and the other wrong? \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/goodart.html#f7n\"><font color=\"#777777\">7</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The thing is, art isn't apples.  Art is man-made. It comes with a\nlot of cultural baggage, and in addition the people who make it\noften try to trick us.  Most people's judgement of art is dominated\nby these extraneous factors; they're like someone trying to judge\nthe taste of apples in a dish made of equal parts apples and jalapeno\npeppers.  All they're tasting is the peppers.  So it turns out you\ncan pick out some people and say that they have better taste than\nothers: they're the ones who actually taste art like apples.<br/><br/>Or to put it more prosaically, they're the people who (a) are hard\nto trick, and (b) don't just like whatever they grew up with.  If\nyou could find people who'd eliminated all such influences on their\njudgement, you'd probably still see variation in what they liked.\nBut because humans have so much in common, you'd also find they\nagreed on a lot.  They'd nearly all prefer the ceiling of the Sistine\nChapel to a blank canvas.<br/><br/><b>Making It</b><br/><br/>I wrote this essay because I was tired of hearing \"taste is subjective\"\nand wanted to kill it once and for all. Anyone who makes things\nknows intuitively that's not true.  When you're trying to make art,\nthe temptation to be lazy is as great as in any other kind of work.\nOf course it matters to do a good job.  And yet you can see how\ngreat a hold \"taste is subjective\" has even in the art world by how\nnervous it makes people to talk about art being good or bad.  Those\nwhose jobs require them to judge art, like curators, mostly resort\nto euphemisms like \"significant\" or \"important\" or (getting dangerously\nclose) \"realized.\" \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/goodart.html#f8n\"><font color=\"#777777\">8</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>I don't have any illusions that being able to talk about art being\ngood or bad will cause the people who talk about it to have anything\nmore useful to say.  Indeed, one of the reasons \"taste is subjective\"\nfound such a receptive audience is that, historically, the things\npeople have said about good taste have generally been such nonsense.<br/><br/>It's not for the people who talk about art that I want to free the\nidea of good art, but for those who \n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/taste.html\">make</a> it.  Right now, ambitious\nkids going to art school run smack into a brick wall.  They arrive\nhoping one day to be as good as the famous artists they've seen in\nbooks, and the first thing they learn is that the concept of good\nhas been retired.  Instead everyone is just supposed to explore\ntheir own personal vision. \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/goodart.html#f9n\"><font color=\"#777777\">9</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>When I was in art school, we were looking one day at a slide of\nsome great fifteenth century painting, and one of the students asked\n\"Why don't artists paint like that now?\" The room suddenly got\nquiet.  Though rarely asked out loud, this question lurks uncomfortably\nin the back of every art student's mind.  It was as if someone had\nbrought up the topic of lung cancer in a meeting within Philip\nMorris.<br/><br/>\"Well,\" the professor replied, \"we're interested in different\nquestions now.\"  He was a pretty nice guy, but at the time I couldn't\nhelp wishing I could send him back to fifteenth century Florence\nto explain in person to Leonardo &amp; Co. how we had moved beyond their\nearly, limited concept of art.  Just imagine that conversation.<br/><br/>In fact, one of the reasons artists in fifteenth century Florence made\nsuch great things was that they believed you could make great things.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/goodart.html#f10n\"><font color=\"#777777\">10</font></a>]</font>\nThey were intensely competitive and were always trying to outdo\none another, like mathematicians or physicists today—maybe like\nanyone who has ever done anything really well.<br/><br/>The idea that you could make great things was not just a useful\nillusion.  They were actually right.  So the most important consequence\nof realizing there can be good art is that it frees artists to try\nto make it.  To the ambitious kids arriving at art school this year\nhoping one day to make great things, I say: don't believe it when\nthey tell you this is a naive and outdated ambition.  There is such\na thing as good art, and if you try to make it, there are people\nwho will notice.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nThis is not to say, of course, that good paintings must\nhave faces in them, just that everyone's visual piano has that key\non it.  There are situations in which you want to avoid faces,\nprecisely because they attract so much attention.  But you can see\nhow universally faces work by their prevalence in\nadvertising.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nThe other reason it's easy to believe is that it makes people\nfeel good.  To a kid, this idea is crack.  In every other respect\nthey're constantly being told that they have a lot to learn.  But\nin this they're perfect.  Their opinion carries the same weight as\nany adult's.  You should probably question anything you believed\nas a kid that you'd want to believe this much.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nIt's conceivable that the elegance of proofs is quantifiable,\nin the sense that there may be some formal measure that turns out\nto coincide with mathematicians' judgements.  Perhaps it would be\nworth trying to make a formal language for proofs in which those\nconsidered more elegant consistently came out shorter (perhaps after\nbeing macroexpanded or compiled).<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f4n\"><font color=\"#000000\">4</font></a>]\nMaybe it would be possible to make art that would appeal to\nspace aliens, but I'm not going to get into that because (a) it's\ntoo hard to answer, and (b) I'm satisfied if I can establish that\ngood art is a meaningful idea for human audiences.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f5n\"><font color=\"#000000\">5</font></a>]\nIf early abstract paintings seem more interesting than later\nones, it may be because the first abstract painters were trained\nto paint from life, and their hands thus tended to make the kind\nof gestures you use in representing physical things.  In effect\nthey were saying \"scaramara\" instead of \"uebfgbsb.\"<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f6n\"><font color=\"#000000\">6</font></a>]\nIt's a bit more complicated, because sometimes artists\nunconsciously use tricks by imitating art that does.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f7n\"><font color=\"#000000\">7</font></a>]\nI phrased this in terms of the taste of apples because if\npeople can see the apples, they can be fooled.  When I was a kid\nmost apples were a variety called Red Delicious that had been bred\nto look appealing in stores, but which didn't taste very good.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f8n\"><font color=\"#000000\">8</font></a>]\nTo be fair, curators are in a difficult position.  If they're\ndealing with recent art, they have to include things in shows that\nthey think are bad.  That's because the test for what gets included\nin shows is basically the market price, and for recent art that is\nlargely determined by successful businessmen and their wives.  So\nit's not always intellectual dishonesty that makes curators and\ndealers use neutral-sounding language.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f9n\"><font color=\"#000000\">9</font></a>]\nWhat happens in practice is that everyone gets really good at\n<i>talking</i> about art.  As the art itself gets more random, the effort\nthat would have gone into the work goes instead into the intellectual\nsounding theory behind it.  \"My work represents an exploration of\ngender and sexuality in an urban context,\" etc.  Different people\nwin at that game.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f10n\"><font color=\"#000000\">10</font></a>]\nThere were several other reasons, including that Florence was\nthen the richest and most sophisticated city in the world, and that\nthey lived in a time before photography had (a) killed portraiture\nas a source of income and (b) made brand the dominant factor in the\nsale of art.<br/><br/>Incidentally, I'm not saying that good art = fifteenth century\nEuropean art.  I'm not saying we should make what they made, but\nthat we should work like they worked.  There are fields now in which\nmany people work with the same energy and honesty that fifteenth\ncentury artists did, but art is not one of them.<br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris \nfor reading drafts of this, and to Paul Watson for permission to \nuse the image at the top.<br/><br/><!-- <a href=\"http://reddit.com\"><img src=\"https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/redditino.png?t=1688221954&\" border=0></a>\n<a href=\"http://reddit.com/info/ufsk/comments\">\nComment</a> on this essay. --><br/><br/><br clear=\"all\"/></font>","date":"2006-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
