{"href":"best.html","title":"The Best Essay","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">March 2024<br/><br/>Despite its title this isn't meant to be the best essay. My goal\nhere is to figure out what the best essay would be like.<br/><br/>It would be well-written, but you can write well about any topic.\nWhat made it special would be what it was about.<br/><br/>Obviously some topics would be better than others. It probably\nwouldn't be about this year's lipstick colors. But it wouldn't be\nvaporous talk about elevated themes either. A good essay has to be\nsurprising. It has to tell people something they don't already know.<br/><br/>The best essay would be on the most important topic you could tell\npeople something surprising about.<br/><br/>That may sound obvious, but it has some unexpected consequences.\nOne is that science enters the picture like an elephant stepping\ninto a rowboat. For example, Darwin first described the idea of\nnatural selection in an essay written in 1844.\nTalk about an\nimportant topic you could tell people something surprising about.\nIf that's the test of a great essay, this was surely the best one\nwritten in 1844. \nAnd indeed, the best possible essay at any given\ntime would usually be one describing the most important scientific\nor technological discovery it was possible to make.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/best.html#f1n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Another unexpected consequence: I imagined when I started writing\nthis that the best essay would be fairly timeless — that the best\nessay you could write in 1844 would be much the same as the best\none you could write now. But in fact the opposite seems to be true.\nIt might be true that the best painting would be timeless in this\nsense. But it wouldn't be impressive to write an essay introducing\nnatural selection now. The best essay <i>now</i> would be one describing\na great discovery we didn't yet know about.<br/><br/>If the question of how to write the best possible essay reduces to\nthe question of how to make great discoveries, then I started with\nthe wrong question. Perhaps what this exercise shows is that we\nshouldn't waste our time writing essays but instead focus on making\ndiscoveries in some specific domain. But I'm interested in essays\nand what can be done with them, so I want to see if there's some\nother question I could have asked.<br/><br/>There is, and on the face of it, it seems almost identical to the\none I started with. Instead of asking <i>what would the best essay\nbe?</i> I should have asked <i>how do you write essays well?</i> Though\nthese seem only phrasing apart, their answers diverge. The answer\nto the first question, as we've seen, isn't really about essay\nwriting. The second question forces it to be.<br/><br/>Writing essays, at its best, is a way of discovering ideas. How do\nyou do that well? How do you discover by writing?<br/><br/>An essay should ordinarily start with what I'm going to call a\nquestion, though I mean this in a very general sense: it doesn't\nhave to be a question grammatically, just something that acts like\none in the sense that it spurs some response.<br/><br/>How do you get this initial question? It probably won't work to\nchoose some important-sounding topic at random and go at it.\nProfessional traders won't even trade unless they have what they\ncall an <i>edge</i> — a convincing story about why in some class of\ntrades they'll win more than they lose. Similarly, you shouldn't\nattack a topic unless you have a way in — some new insight about\nit or way of approaching it.<br/><br/>You don't need to have a complete thesis; you just need some kind\nof gap you can explore. In fact, merely having questions about\nsomething other people take for granted can be edge enough.<br/><br/>If you come across a question that's sufficiently puzzling, it could\nbe worth exploring even if it doesn't seem very momentous. Many an\nimportant discovery has been made by pulling on a thread that seemed\ninsignificant at first. How can they <i>all</i> be finches? \n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/best.html#f2n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Once you've got a question, then what? You start thinking out loud\nabout it. Not literally out loud, but you commit to a specific\nstring of words in response, as you would if you were talking. This\ninitial response is usually mistaken or incomplete. Writing converts\nyour ideas from vague to bad. But that's a step forward, because\nonce you can see the brokenness, you can fix it.<br/><br/>Perhaps beginning writers are alarmed at the thought of starting\nwith something mistaken or incomplete, but you shouldn't be, because\nthis is why essay writing works. Forcing yourself to commit to some\nspecific string of words gives you a starting point, and if it's\nwrong, you'll see that when you reread it. At least half of essay\nwriting is rereading what you've written and asking <i>is this correct\nand complete?</i> You have to be very strict when rereading, not just\nbecause you want to keep yourself honest, but because a gap between\nyour response and the truth is often a sign of new ideas to be\ndiscovered.<br/><br/>The prize for being strict with what you've written is not just\nrefinement. When you take a roughly correct answer and try to make\nit exactly right, sometimes you find that you can't, and that the\nreason is that you were depending on a false assumption. And when\nyou discard it, the answer turns out to be completely different.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/best.html#f3n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">3</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Ideally the response to a question is two things: the first step\nin a process that converges on the truth, and a source of additional\nquestions (in my very general sense of the word). So the process\ncontinues recursively, as response spurs response. \n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/best.html#f4n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">4</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Usually there are several possible responses to a question, which\nmeans you're traversing a tree. But essays are linear, not tree-shaped,\nwhich means you have to choose one branch to follow at each point.\nHow do you choose? Usually you should follow whichever offers the\ngreatest combination of generality and novelty. I don't consciously\nrank branches this way; I just follow whichever seems most exciting;\nbut generality and novelty are what make a branch exciting. \n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/best.html#f5n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">5</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>If you're willing to do a lot of rewriting, you don't have to guess\nright. You can follow a branch and see how it turns out, and if it\nisn't good enough, cut it and backtrack. I do this all the time.\nIn this essay I've already cut a 17-paragraph subtree, in addition\nto countless shorter ones. Maybe I'll reattach it at the end, or\nboil it down to a footnote, or spin it off as its own essay; we'll\nsee. \n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/best.html#f6n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">6</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>In general you want to be quick to cut. One of the most dangerous\ntemptations in writing (and in software and painting) is to keep\nsomething that isn't right, just because it contains a few good bits\nor cost you a lot of effort.<br/><br/>The most surprising new question being thrown off at this point is\n<i>does it really matter what the initial question is?</i> If the space\nof ideas is highly connected, it shouldn't, because you should be\nable to get from any question to the most valuable ones in a few\nhops. And we see evidence that it's highly connected in the way,\nfor example, that people who are obsessed with some topic can turn\nany conversation toward it. But that only works if you know where\nyou want to go, and you don't in an essay. That's the whole point.\nYou don't want to be the obsessive conversationalist, or all your\nessays will be about the same thing. \n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/best.html#f7n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">7</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The other reason the initial question matters is that you usually\nfeel somewhat obliged to stick to it. I don't think about this when\nI decide which branch to follow. I just follow novelty and generality.\nSticking to the question is enforced later, when I notice I've\nwandered too far and have to backtrack. But I think this is\nthe optimal solution. You don't want the hunt for novelty and\ngenerality to be constrained in the moment. Go with it and see what\nyou get.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/best.html#f8n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">8</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Since the initial question does constrain you, in the best case it\nsets an upper bound on the quality of essay you'll write. If you\ndo as well as you possibly can on the chain of thoughts that follow\nfrom the initial question, the initial question itself is the only\nplace where there's room for variation.<br/><br/>It would be a mistake to let this make you too conservative though,\nbecause you can't predict where a question will lead. Not if you're\ndoing things right, because doing things right means making\ndiscoveries, and by definition you can't predict those. So the way\nto respond to this situation is not to be cautious about which\ninitial question you choose, but to write a lot of essays. Essays\nare for taking risks.<br/><br/>Almost any question can get you a good essay. Indeed, it took some\neffort to think of a sufficiently unpromising topic in the third\nparagraph, because any essayist's first impulse on hearing that the\nbest essay couldn't be about x would be to try to write it. But if\nmost questions yield good essays, only some yield great ones.<br/><br/>Can we predict which questions will yield great essays? Considering\nhow long I've been writing essays, it's alarming how novel that\nquestion feels.<br/><br/>One thing I like in an initial question is outrageousness. I love\nquestions that seem naughty in some way — for example, by seeming\ncounterintuitive or overambitious or heterodox. Ideally all three.\nThis essay is an example. Writing about the best essay implies there\nis such a thing, which pseudo-intellectuals will dismiss as reductive,\nthough it follows necessarily from the possibility of one essay\nbeing better than another. And thinking about how to do something\nso ambitious is close enough to doing it that it holds your attention.<br/><br/>I like to start an essay with a gleam in my eye. This could be just\na taste of mine, but there's one aspect of it that probably isn't:\nto write a really good essay on some topic, you have to be interested\nin it. A good writer can write well about anything, but to stretch\nfor the novel insights that are the raison d'etre of the essay, you\nhave to care.<br/><br/>If caring about it is one of the criteria for a good initial question,\nthen the optimal question varies from person to person. It also\nmeans you're more likely to write great essays if you care about a\nlot of different things. The more curious you are, the greater the\nprobable overlap between the set of things you're curious about and\nthe set of topics that yield great essays.<br/><br/>What other qualities would a great initial question have? It's\nprobably good if it has implications in a lot of different areas.\nAnd I find it's a good sign if it's one that people think has already\nbeen thoroughly explored. But the truth is that I've barely thought\nabout how to choose initial questions, because I rarely do it. I\nrarely <i>choose</i> what to write about; I just start thinking about\nsomething, and sometimes it turns into an essay.<br/><br/>Am I going to stop writing essays about whatever I happen to be\nthinking about and instead start working my way through some\nsystematically generated list of topics? That doesn't sound like\nmuch fun. And yet I want to write good essays, and if the initial\nquestion matters, I should care about it.<br/><br/>Perhaps the answer is to go one step earlier: to write about whatever\npops into your head, but try to ensure that what pops into your\nhead is good. Indeed, now that I think about it, this has to be the\nanswer, because a mere list of topics wouldn't be any use if you\ndidn't have edge with any of them. To start writing an essay, you\nneed a topic plus some initial insight about it, and you can't\ngenerate those systematically. If only. \n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/best.html#f9n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">9</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>You can probably cause yourself to have more of them, though. The\nquality of the ideas that come out of your head depends on what goes\nin, and you can improve that in two dimensions, breadth and depth.<br/><br/>You can't learn everything, so getting breadth implies learning\nabout topics that are very different from one another. When I tell\npeople about my book-buying trips to Hay and they ask what I buy\nbooks about, I usually feel a bit sheepish answering, because the\ntopics seem like a laundry list of unrelated subjects. But perhaps\nthat's actually optimal in this business.<br/><br/>You can also get ideas by talking to people, by doing and building\nthings, and by going places and seeing things. I don't think it's\nimportant to talk to new people so much as the sort of people who\nmake you have new ideas. I get more new ideas after talking for an\nafternoon with Robert Morris than from talking to 20 new smart\npeople. I know because that's what a block of office hours at Y\nCombinator consists of.<br/><br/>While breadth comes from reading and talking and seeing, depth comes\nfrom doing. The way to really learn about some domain is to have\nto solve problems in it. Though this could take the form of writing,\nI suspect that to be a good essayist you also have to do, or have\ndone, some other kind of work. That may not be true for most other\nfields, but essay writing is different. You could spend half your\ntime working on something else and be net ahead, so long as it was\nhard.<br/><br/>I'm not proposing that as a recipe so much as an encouragement to\nthose already doing it. If you've spent all your life so far working\non other things, you're already halfway there. Though of course to\nbe good at writing you have to like it, and if you like writing\nyou'd probably have spent at least some time doing it.<br/><br/>Everything I've said about initial questions applies also to the\nquestions you encounter in writing the essay. They're the same\nthing; every subtree of an essay is usually a shorter essay, just\nas every subtree of a Calder mobile is a smaller mobile. So any\ntechnique that gets you good initial questions also gets you good\nwhole essays.<br/><br/>At some point the cycle of question and response reaches what feels\nlike a natural end. Which is a little suspicious; shouldn't every\nanswer suggest more questions? I think what happens is that you\nstart to feel sated. Once you've covered enough interesting ground,\nyou start to lose your appetite for new questions. Which is just\nas well, because the reader is probably feeling sated too. And it's\nnot lazy to stop asking questions, because you could instead be\nasking the initial question of a new essay.<br/><br/>That's the ultimate source of drag on the connectedness of ideas:\nthe discoveries you make along the way. If you discover enough\nstarting from question A, you'll never make it to question B. Though\nif you keep writing essays you'll gradually fix this problem by\nburning off such discoveries. So bizarrely enough, writing lots of\nessays makes it as if the space of ideas were more highly connected.<br/><br/>When a subtree comes to an end, you can do one of two things. You\ncan either stop, or pull the Cubist trick of laying separate subtrees\nend to end by returning to a question you skipped earlier. Usually\nit requires some sleight of hand to make the essay flow continuously\nat this point, but not this time. This time I actually need an\nexample of the phenomenon. For example, we discovered earlier that\nthe best possible essay wouldn't usually be timeless in the way the\nbest painting would. This seems surprising enough to be\nworth investigating further.<br/><br/>There are two senses in which an essay can be timeless: to be about\na matter of permanent importance, and always to have the same effect\non readers. With art these two senses blend together. Art that\nlooked beautiful to the ancient Greeks still looks beautiful to us.\nBut with essays the two senses diverge, because essays\nteach, and you can't teach people something they already know.\nNatural selection is certainly a matter of permanent importance,\nbut an essay explaining it couldn't have the same effect on us that\nit would have had on Darwin's contemporaries, precisely because his\nideas were so successful that everyone already knows about them.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/best.html#f10n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">10</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>I imagined when I started writing this that the best possible essay\nwould be timeless in the stricter, evergreen sense: that it would\ncontain some deep, timeless wisdom that would appeal equally to\nAristotle and Feynman. That doesn't seem to be true. But if the\nbest possible essay wouldn't usually be timeless in this stricter\nsense, what would it take to write essays that were?<br/><br/>The answer to that turns out to be very strange: to be the evergreen\nkind of timeless, an essay has to be ineffective, in the sense that\nits discoveries aren't assimilated into our shared culture. Otherwise\nthere will be nothing new in it for the second generation of readers.\nIf you want to surprise readers not just now but in the future as\nwell, you have to write essays that won't stick — essays that,\nno matter how good they are, won't become part of what people in\nthe future learn before they read them. \n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/best.html#f11n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">11</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>I can imagine several ways to do that. One would be to write about\nthings people never learn. For example, it's a long-established\npattern for ambitious people to chase after various types of prizes,\nand only later, perhaps too late, to realize that some of them\nweren't worth as much as they thought. If you write about that, you\ncan be confident of a conveyor belt of future readers to be surprised\nby it.<br/><br/>Ditto if you write about the tendency of the inexperienced to overdo\nthings — of young engineers to produce overcomplicated solutions,\nfor example. There are some kinds of mistakes people never learn\nto avoid except by making them. Any of those should be a timeless\ntopic.<br/><br/>Sometimes when we're slow to grasp things it's not just because\nwe're obtuse or in denial but because we've been deliberately lied\nto. There are a lot of things adults <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/lies.html\"><u>lie</u></a> \nto kids about, and when\nyou reach adulthood, they don't take you aside and hand you a list\nof them. They don't remember which lies they told you, and most\nwere implicit anyway. So contradicting such lies will be a source\nof surprises for as long as adults keep telling them.<br/><br/>Sometimes it's systems that lie to you. For example, the educational\nsystems in most countries train you to win by \n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/lesson.html\"><u>hacking the test</u></a>. But\nthat's not how you win at the most important real-world tests, and\nafter decades of training, this is hard for new arrivals in the real\nworld to grasp. Helping them overcome such institutional lies will\nwork as long as the institutions remain broken. \n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/best.html#f12n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">12</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Another recipe for timelessness is to write about things readers\nalready know, but in much more detail than can be transmitted\nculturally. \"Everyone knows,\" for example, that it can be rewarding\nto have <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/kids.html\"><u>kids</u></a>. But till you have them you don't know precisely what\nforms that takes, and even then much of what you know you may never\nhave put into words.<br/><br/>I've written about all these kinds of topics. But I didn't do it\nin a deliberate attempt to write essays that were timeless in the\nstricter sense. And indeed, the fact that this depends on one's ideas\nnot sticking suggests that it's not worth making a deliberate attempt\nto. You should write about topics of timeless importance, yes, but\nif you do such a good job that your conclusions stick and future\ngenerations find your essay obvious instead of novel, so much the\nbetter. You've crossed into Darwin territory.<br/><br/>Writing about topics of timeless importance is an instance of\nsomething even more general, though: breadth of applicability. And\nthere are more kinds of breadth than chronological — applying to\nlots of different fields, for example. So breadth is the ultimate\naim.<br/><br/>I already aim for it. Breadth and novelty are the two things I'm\nalways chasing. But I'm glad I understand where timelessness fits.<br/><br/>I understand better where a lot of things fit now. This essay has\nbeen a kind of tour of essay writing. I started out hoping to get\nadvice about topics; if you assume good writing, the only thing\nleft to differentiate the best essay is its topic. And I did get\nadvice about topics: discover natural selection. Yeah, that would\nbe nice. But when you step back and ask what's the best you can do\nshort of making some great discovery like that, the answer turns\nout to be about procedure. Ultimately the quality of an essay is a\nfunction of the ideas discovered in it, and the way you get them\nis by casting a wide net for questions and then being very exacting\nwith the answers.<br/><br/>The most striking feature of this map of essay writing are the\nalternating stripes of inspiration and effort required. The questions\ndepend on inspiration, but the answers can be got by sheer persistence.\nYou don't have to get an answer right the first time, but there's\nno excuse for not getting it right eventually, because you can keep\nrewriting till you do. And this is not just a theoretical possibility.\nIt's a pretty accurate description of the way I work. I'm rewriting\nas we speak.<br/><br/>But although I wish I could say that writing great essays depends mostly\non effort, in the limit case it's inspiration that makes the\ndifference. In the limit case, the questions are the harder thing\nto get. That pool has no bottom.<br/><br/>How to get more questions? That is the most important question of\nall.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nThere might be some resistance to this conclusion on the\ngrounds that some of these discoveries could only be understood by\na small number of readers. But you get into all sorts of difficulties\nif you want to disqualify essays on this account. How do you decide\nwhere the cutoff should be? If a virus kills off everyone except a \nhandful of people sequestered at Los Alamos,\ncould an essay that had been disqualified now be eligible? Etc.<br/><br/>Darwin's 1844 essay was derived from an earlier version written in 1839.\nExtracts from it were published in 1858.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nWhen you find yourself very curious about an apparently minor\nquestion, that's an exciting sign. Evolution has designed you to\npay attention to things that matter. So when you're very curious\nabout something random, that could mean you've unconsciously noticed\nit's less random than it seems.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nCorollary: If you're not intellectually honest, your writing\nwon't just be biased, but also boring, because you'll miss all the\nideas you'd have discovered if you pushed for the truth.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f4n\"><font color=\"#000000\">4</font></a>]\nSometimes this process begins before you start writing.\nSometimes you've already figured out the first few things you want\nto say. Schoolchildren are often taught they should decide <i>everything</i>\nthey want to say, and write this down as an outline before they\nstart writing the essay itself. Maybe that's a good way to get them\nstarted — or not, I don't know — but it's antithetical to the\nspirit of essay writing. The more detailed your outline, the less\nyour ideas can benefit from the sort of discovery that essays are for.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f5n\"><font color=\"#000000\">5</font></a>]\nThe problem with this type of \"greedy\" algorithm is that you\ncan end up on a local maximum. If the most valuable question is\npreceded by a boring one, you'll overlook it. But I can't imagine\na better strategy. There's no lookahead except by writing. So use\na greedy algorithm and a lot of time.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f6n\"><font color=\"#000000\">6</font></a>]\nI ended up reattaching the first 5 of the 17 paragraphs, and\ndiscarding the rest.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f7n\"><font color=\"#000000\">7</font></a>]\nStephen Fry confessed to making use of this phenomenon when\ntaking exams at Oxford. He had in his head a standard essay about\nsome general literary topic, and he would find a way to turn the\nexam question toward it and then just reproduce it again.<br/><br/>Strictly speaking it's the graph of ideas that would be highly\nconnected, not the space, but that usage would confuse people who\ndon't know graph theory, whereas people who do know it will get\nwhat I mean if I say \"space\".<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f8n\"><font color=\"#000000\">8</font></a>]\nToo far doesn't depend just on the distance from the original\ntopic. It's more like that distance divided by the value of whatever\nI've discovered in the subtree.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f9n\"><font color=\"#000000\">9</font></a>]\nOr can you? I should try writing about this.

The ancient Greeks' naturalistic sculptures\nrepresented a new idea, and must have been extra exciting to\ncontemporaries on that account.
