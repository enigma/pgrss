I could see the average town was\nlike a roach motel for startup ambitions: smart, ambitious people\nwent in, but no startups came out.  But I was never able to figure\nout exactly what happened inside the motel—exactly what was\nkilling all the potential startups.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/hubs.html#f1n\"><font color=\"#999999\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>A couple weeks ago I finally figured it out. I was framing the\nquestion wrong.  The problem is not that most towns kill startups.\nIt's that death is the <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/die.html\">default</a> for startups,\nand most towns don't save them.  Instead of thinking of most places\nas being sprayed with startupicide, it's more accurate to think of\nstartups as all being poisoned, and a few places being sprayed with\nthe antidote.<br/><br/>Startups in other places are just doing what startups naturally do:\nfail.  The real question is, what's <i>saving</i> startups in places\nlike Silicon Valley?\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/hubs.html#f2n\"><font color=\"#999999\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/><b>Environment</b><br/><br/>I think there are two components to the antidote: being in a place\nwhere startups are the cool thing to do, and chance meetings with\npeople who can help you.  And what drives them both is the number\nof startup people around you.<br/><br/>The first component is particularly helpful in the first stage of\na startup's life, when you go from merely having an interest in\nstarting a company to actually doing it.  It's quite a leap to start\na startup.  It's an unusual thing to do. But in Silicon Valley it\nseems normal.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/hubs.html#f3n\"><font color=\"#999999\">3</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>In most places, if you start a startup, people treat you as if\nyou're unemployed.  People in the Valley aren't automatically\nimpressed with you just because you're starting a company, but they\npay attention.  Anyone who's been here any amount of time knows not\nto default to skepticism, no matter how inexperienced you seem or\nhow unpromising your idea sounds at first, because they've all seen\ninexperienced founders with unpromising sounding ideas who a few\nyears later were billionaires.<br/><br/>Having people around you care about what you're doing is an\nextraordinarily <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/cities.html\">powerful</a> force.  Even the\nmost willful people are susceptible to it.  About a year after we\nstarted Y Combinator I said something to a partner at a well known\nVC firm that gave him the (mistaken) impression I was considering\nstarting another startup.  He responded so eagerly that for about\nhalf a second I found myself considering doing it.<br/><br/>In most other cities, the prospect of starting a startup just doesn't\nseem real.  In the Valley it's not only real but fashionable.  That\nno doubt causes a lot of people to start startups who shouldn't.\nBut I think that's ok.  Few people are suited to running a startup,\nand it's very hard to predict beforehand which are (as I know all\ntoo well from being in the business of trying to predict beforehand),\nso lots of people starting startups who shouldn't is probably the\noptimal state of affairs.  As long as you're at a point in your\nlife when you can bear the risk of failure, the best way to find\nout if you're suited to running a startup is to <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/notnot.html\">try\nit</a>.<br/><br/><b>Chance</b><br/><br/>The second component of the antidote is chance meetings with people\nwho can help you.  This force works in both phases: both in the\ntransition from the desire to start a startup to starting one, and\nthe transition from starting a company to succeeding.  The power\nof chance meetings is more variable than people around you caring\nabout startups, which is like a sort of background radiation that\naffects everyone equally, but at its strongest it is far stronger.<br/><br/>Chance meetings produce miracles to compensate for the disasters\nthat characteristically befall startups.  In the Valley, terrible\nthings happen to startups all the time, just like they do to startups\neverywhere.  The reason startups are more likely to make it here\nis that great things happen to them too.  In the Valley, lightning\nhas a sign bit.<br/><br/>For example, you start a site for college students and you decide\nto move to the Valley for the summer to work on it.  And then on a\nrandom suburban street in Palo Alto you happen to run into Sean\nParker, who understands the domain really well because he started\na similar startup himself, and also knows all the investors.  And\nmoreover has advanced views, for 2004, on founders retaining <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/control.html\">control</a> of their companies.<br/><br/>You can't say precisely what the miracle will be, or even for sure\nthat one will happen.  The best one can say is: if you're in a\nstartup hub, unexpected good things will probably happen to you,\nespecially if you deserve them.<br/><br/>I bet this is true even for startups we fund.  Even with us working\nto make things happen for them on purpose rather than by accident,\nthe frequency of helpful chance meetings in the Valley is so high\nthat it's still a significant increment on what we can deliver.<br/><br/>Chance meetings play a role like the role relaxation plays in having\nideas.  Most people have had the experience of working hard on some\nproblem, not being able to solve it, giving up and going to bed,\nand then thinking of the answer in the shower in the morning.  What\nmakes the answer appear is letting your thoughts <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/top.html\">drift</a> a bit—and thus drift off the wrong\npath you'd been pursuing last night and onto the right one adjacent\nto it.<br/><br/>Chance meetings let your acquaintance drift in the same way taking\na shower lets your thoughts drift. The critical thing in both cases\nis that they drift just the right amount.  The meeting between Larry\nPage and Sergey Brin was a good example.  They let their acquaintance\ndrift, but only a little; they were both meeting someone they had\na lot in common with.<br/><br/>For Larry Page the most important component of the antidote was\nSergey Brin, and vice versa.  The antidote is \n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/siliconvalley.html\">people</a>.  It's not the\nphysical infrastructure of Silicon Valley that makes it work, or\nthe weather, or anything like that.  Those helped get it started,\nbut now that the reaction is self-sustaining what drives it is the\npeople.<br/><br/>Many observers have noticed that one of the most distinctive things\nabout startup hubs is the degree to which people help one another\nout, with no expectation of getting anything in return.  I'm not\nsure why this is so.  Perhaps it's because startups are less of a\nzero sum game than most types of business; they are rarely killed\nby competitors.  Or perhaps it's because so many startup founders\nhave backgrounds in the sciences, where collaboration is encouraged.<br/><br/>A large part of YC's function is to accelerate that process.  We're\na sort of Valley within the Valley, where the density of people\nworking on startups and their willingness to help one another are\nboth artificially amplified.<br/><br/><b>Numbers</b><br/><br/>Both components of the antidote—an environment that encourages\nstartups, and chance meetings with people who help you—are\ndriven by the same underlying cause: the number of startup people\naround you.  To make a startup hub, you need a <i>lot</i> of people\ninterested in startups.<br/><br/>There are three reasons. The first, obviously, is that if you don't\nhave enough density, the chance meetings don't happen.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/hubs.html#f4n\"><font color=\"#999999\">4</font></a>]</font>\nThe second is that different startups need such different things, so\nyou need a lot of people to supply each startup with what they need\nmost.  Sean Parker was exactly what Facebook needed in 2004.  Another\nstartup might have needed a database guy, or someone with connections\nin the movie business.<br/><br/>This is one of the reasons we fund such a large number of companies,\nincidentally.  The bigger the community, the greater the chance it\nwill contain the person who has that one thing you need most.<br/><br/>The third reason you need a lot of people to make a startup hub is\nthat once you have enough people interested in the same problem,\nthey start to set the social norms.  And it is a particularly\nvaluable thing when the atmosphere around you encourages you to do\nsomething that would otherwise seem too ambitious.  In most places\nthe atmosphere pulls you back toward the mean.<br/><br/>I flew into the Bay Area a few days ago.  I notice this every time\nI fly over the Valley: somehow you can sense something is going on.  \nObviously you can sense prosperity in how well kept a\nplace looks.  But there are different kinds of prosperity.  Silicon\nValley doesn't look like Boston, or New York, or LA, or DC.  I tried\nasking myself what word I'd use to describe the feeling the Valley\nradiated, and the word that came to mind was optimism.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nI'm not saying it's impossible to succeed in a city with few\nother startups, just harder.  If you're sufficiently good at\ngenerating your own morale, you can survive without external\nencouragement.  Wufoo was based in Tampa and they succeeded.  But\nthe Wufoos are exceptionally disciplined.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nIncidentally, this phenomenon is not limited to startups.  Most\nunusual ambitions fail, unless the person who has them manages to\nfind the right sort of community.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nStarting a company is common, but starting a startup is rare.\nI've talked about the distinction between the two elsewhere, but\nessentially a startup is a new business designed for scale.  Most\nnew businesses are service businesses and except in rare cases those\ndon't scale.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f4n\"><font color=\"#000000\">4</font></a>]\nAs I was writing this, I had a demonstration of the density of\nstartup people in the Valley.  Jessica and I bicycled to University\nAve in Palo Alto to have lunch at the fabulous Oren's Hummus.  As\nwe walked in, we met Charlie Cheever sitting near the door.  Selina\nTobaccowala stopped to say hello on her way out.  Then Josh Wilson\ncame in to pick up a take out order.  After lunch we went to get\nfrozen yogurt.  On the way we met Rajat Suri.  When we got to the\nyogurt place, we found Dave Shen there, and as we walked out we ran\ninto Yuri Sagalov.  We walked with him for a block or so and we ran\ninto Muzzammil Zaveri, and then a block later we met Aydin Senkut.\nThis is everyday life in Palo Alto.  I wasn't trying to meet people;\nI was just having lunch.  And I'm sure for every startup founder\nor investor I saw that I knew, there were 5 more I didn't.  If Ron\nConway had been with us he would have met 30 people he knew.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Jessica Livingston, and\nHarj Taggar for reading drafts of this.<br/><br/></br></p></font>","date":"2011-10-01T00:00:00Z"}
