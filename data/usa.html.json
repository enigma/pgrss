{"href":"usa.html","title":"Made in USA","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">November 2004<br/><br/><i>(This is a new essay for the Japanese edition of \n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0596006624\">Hackers \n&amp; Painters</a>.\nIt tries to explain why Americans make some things well \nand others badly.)</i><br/><br/>A few years ago an Italian friend of mine travelled by train from\nBoston to Providence.  She had only been in America for a\ncouple weeks and hadn't seen much of the country yet.  She arrived\nlooking astonished.  \"It's so <i>ugly!\"</i><br/><br/>People from other rich countries can scarcely imagine\nthe squalor of the man-made bits of America.  In travel books\nthey show you mostly natural environments: the Grand Canyon,\nwhitewater rafting, horses in a field.  If you see\npictures with man-made things in them, it will be either a\nview of the New York skyline shot from a discreet distance,\nor a carefully cropped image of a seacoast town in Maine.<br/><br/>How can it be, visitors must wonder.  How can the richest country\nin the world look like this?<br/><br/>Oddly enough, it may not be a coincidence.  Americans are good\nat some things and bad at others.  We're good at making\nmovies and software, and bad at making cars and cities.\nAnd I think we may be good at what we're good at for the same\nreason we're bad at what we're bad at.  We're impatient.\nIn America, if you want to do something, you don't worry that\nit might come out badly, or upset delicate social balances, or\nthat people might think you're getting above yourself.  If you\nwant to do something, as Nike says, <i>just do it.</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>This works well in some fields and badly in others.  I suspect\nit works in movies and software because they're both messy  \nprocesses.  \"Systematic\"\nis the last word I'd use to describe the way \n<a href=\"gh.html\">good programmers</a> write software.\nCode is not something they assemble painstakingly after\ncareful planning, like the pyramids.  It's something they\nplunge into, working fast and constantly changing their minds,\nlike a charcoal sketch.<br/><br/>In software, paradoxical\nas it sounds, good craftsmanship means working fast.\nIf you work slowly and meticulously,\nyou merely end up with a very fine implementation of your initial,\nmistaken idea.\nWorking slowly and meticulously is\npremature optimization.  Better to get a\nprototype done fast, and see what new ideas\nit gives you.<br/><br/>It sounds like making movies works a lot like making software.\nEvery movie is a Frankenstein, full of imperfections\nand usually quite different from what was originally envisioned.  \nBut interesting, and finished fairly quickly.  <!--If you tried to\nmake movies perfect, they'd never be done.--><br/><br/>I think we get away with this in movies and software\nbecause they're both malleable mediums.  Boldness pays.\n<!-- Nothing is\nset in stone.  You can get away\nwith last minute changes.-->\nAnd if at the last minute two parts don't quite   \nfit, you can figure out some hack that will at least conceal\nthe problem.<br/><br/>Not so with cars, or cities.  They are all too physical.\nIf the car business worked like software or movies, you'd\nsurpass your competitors by making a car that weighed only\nfifty pounds, or folded up to the size of a motorcycle when   \nyou wanted to park it.  But with physical products there are\nmore constraints.  You don't win by dramatic innovations\nso much as by good taste and attention to detail.<br/><br/>The trouble is, the very word \"taste\"\nsounds slightly ridiculous to American ears.\nIt seems pretentious, or frivolous, or even effeminate.\nBlue staters think it's \"subjective,\" and red staters \nthink it's for sissies.  So anyone in America\nwho really cares about design will be sailing upwind.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Twenty years ago we used to hear that the problem with\nthe US car industry was the workers.\nWe don't hear that any more now that Japanese companies\nare building cars in the US.   The problem with\nAmerican cars is bad design.  You can see that just by\nlooking at them.<br/><br/>All that extra sheet metal on the <a href=\"matador.html\">AMC Matador</a> wasn't\nadded by the workers.  The problem\nwith this car, as with American cars today, is that it was\ndesigned by marketing people instead of designers.<br/><br/>Why do the Japanese make better cars than us?  Some say it's\nbecause their culture encourages cooperation.  That may come\ninto it.   But in this case it seems more to the point that\ntheir culture prizes design and craftsmanship.<br/><br/>For centuries the Japanese have made finer things than we\nhave in the West.  When you look at swords they\nmade in 1200, you just can't believe the date on the label\nis right.\nPresumably their cars fit together more   \nprecisely than ours for the same reason their joinery always has.\nThey're obsessed with making things well.<br/><br/>Not us.\nWhen we make something in America, our aim is just to get the   \njob done.  Once we reach that point, we take one of two routes.\nWe can stop there, and have something crude but\nserviceable, like a Vise-grip.  Or we can improve it,\nwhich usually means encrusting it with gratuitous ornament.\nWhen we want to make a car \"better,\"\nwe stick <a href=\"59eldorado.html\">tail fins</a> on it, or make it \n<a href=\"75eldorado.html\">longer</a>, or make the  \n<a href=\"04magnum.html\">windows smaller</a>, depending on the current fashion.<br/><br/>Ditto for houses.  In America you can have either a flimsy box banged\ntogether out of two by fours and drywall, or a McMansion-- a\nflimsy box banged together out of two by fours and drywall,\nbut larger, more dramatic-looking, and full of expensive fittings.\nRich people don't get better design or craftsmanship;\nthey just get a larger, more conspicuous version of the\nstandard house.<br/><br/>We don't especially prize design or craftsmanship here.  What\nwe like is speed, and we're willing to do something in an ugly\nway to get it done fast.  In some\nfields, like software or movies, this is a net win.  \n<!-- But in\nothers, like cars or consumer electronics, it isn't.  --><br/><br/>But it's not just that software and movies are malleable mediums.\nIn those businesses, the designers (though they're\nnot generally called that) have more power.   \nSoftware companies, at least successful ones, tend to be run\nby programmers.  And in the film industry, though producers\nmay second-guess directors, the director controls most of\nwhat appears on the screen.\nAnd so American software and movies, and Japanese cars, all\nhave this in common: the people in charge care about\ndesign-- the former because the designers are in charge, and the latter\nbecause the whole culture cares about design.<br/><br/>I think most Japanese executives would be horrified at\nthe idea of making a bad car.  Whereas American executives,\nin their hearts, still believe the most important thing about\na car is the image it projects.\nMake a good car?  What's \"good?\"  It's so <i>subjective.</i>\nIf you want to know how to design a car, ask a focus group.<br/><br/>Instead of relying on their own internal design compass\n(like Henry Ford did),\nAmerican car companies try to make what marketing people\nthink consumers want.  But it isn't working.  American cars continue\nto lose market share.  And the reason is that the customer\ndoesn't want what he thinks he wants.<br/><br/>Letting focus groups design your cars for you  \nonly wins in the short term.  In the long term, it pays\nto bet on good design.  The focus group may say they want the\nmeretricious feature du jour, but what they want even more is\nto imitate sophisticated buyers, and they, though a\nsmall minority, really do care about good design.\nEventually the\npimps and drug dealers notice that the doctors and lawyers\nhave switched from Cadillac to Lexus, and do the same.<br/><br/>Apple is an interesting counterexample to the general\nAmerican trend.  If you want to buy a nice CD player, you'll\nprobably buy a Japanese one.  But if you want to buy an\nMP3 player, you'll probably buy an iPod.  What happened?\nWhy doesn't Sony dominate MP3 players?  Because Apple is\nin the consumer electronics business now, and unlike\nother American companies, they're obsessed with good design.  \nOr more precisely, their CEO is.<br/><br/>I just got an iPod, and it's not just nice.  It's     \n<i>surprisingly</i> nice.  For it to surprise me, it must be\nsatisfying expectations I didn't know I had.  No focus\ngroup is going to discover those.  Only a great   \ndesigner can.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Cars aren't the worst thing we make in America.\nWhere the just-do-it model fails most dramatically is in our cities-- or\nrather, <a href=\"denver.html\">exurbs</a>.\nIf real estate developers operated on a large enough scale, if\nthey built whole towns, market forces would compel\nthem to build towns that didn't suck.  But they only build a\ncouple office buildings or suburban streets at a time, and the\nresult is so depressing that the inhabitants consider it a great\ntreat to fly to Europe and spend a couple weeks living what\nis, for people there, just everyday life. [1]<br/><br/>But the just-do-it model does have advantages.  It seems the clear\nwinner for generating wealth and technical innovations\n(which are practically the same thing).  I think speed is the reason.\nIt's hard to create wealth by making a commodity.  The\nreal value is in things that are new, and if you want to\nbe the first to make something, it helps to work fast.\nFor better or worse, the just-do-it model is fast,\nwhether you're Dan Bricklin writing the prototype of VisiCalc in\na weekend, or a real estate developer\nbuilding a block of shoddy condos in a month.<br/><br/>If I had to choose between the just-do-it model and the\ncareful model, I'd probably choose just-do-it.\nBut do we have to choose?  Could we have it both ways?\nCould Americans have nice\nplaces to live without undermining the impatient, individualistic spirit\nthat makes us good at software?  Could other countries\nintroduce more individualism into their technology companies\nand research labs without having it metastasize as strip malls?\nI'm optimistic.  It's harder to\nsay about other countries, but in the US, at least, I think \nwe can have both.<br/><br/>Apple is an encouraging example.  They've managed to preserve\nenough of the impatient, hackerly spirit you need to write\nsoftware.  And yet when\nyou pick up a new Apple laptop, well, it doesn't\nseem American.  It's too perfect.  It seems as if it\nmust have been made by a Swedish or a Japanese company.<br/><br/>In many technologies, version 2 has higher resolution.  Why\nnot in design generally?  I think we'll gradually see\nnational characters superseded\nby occupational characters: hackers in Japan will be allowed\nto behave with a <a href=\"gba.html\">willfulness</a> \nthat would now seem unJapanese,\nand products in America will be designed with an\ninsistence on <a href=\"taste.html\">taste</a> that would now seem unAmerican.\nPerhaps the most successful countries, in the future, will be\nthose most willing to ignore what are now considered\nnational characters, and do each kind of work in the way\nthat works best.  Race you.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[1] Japanese cities are ugly too, but for different reasons.\nJapan is prone to earthquakes, so buildings are traditionally\nseen as temporary; there is no grand tradition of  city planning\nlike the one Europeans inherited from Rome.  The other cause is\nthe notoriously corrupt relationship between the government\nand construction companies.<br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Barry Eisler, Sarah Harlin,\nShiro Kawai, Jessica Livingston, Jackie McDonough, Robert Morris, \nand Eric Raymond\nfor reading drafts of this.<br/><br/><br clear=\"all\"/></font>","date":"2004-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
