{"href":"hs.html","title":"What You'll Wish You'd Known","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">January 2005<br/><br/><i>(I wrote this talk for a\nhigh school.  I never actually \ngave it, because the school authorities vetoed the plan to invite me.)</i><br/><br/>When I said I was speaking at a high school, my friends were curious.\nWhat will you say to high school students?  So I asked them, what\ndo you wish someone had told you in high school?  Their answers\nwere remarkably similar.  So I'm going to tell you what we all wish\nsomeone had told us.<br/><br/>I'll start by telling you something you don't have to know in high\nschool: what you want to do with your life.  People are always\nasking you this, so you think you're supposed to have an answer.\nBut adults ask this mainly as a conversation starter.   They want\nto know what sort of person you are, and this question is just to\nget you talking.  They ask it the way you might poke a hermit crab\nin a tide pool, to see what it does.<br/><br/>If I were back in high school and someone asked about my plans, I'd\nsay that my first priority was to learn what the options were.  You\ndon't need to be in a rush to choose your life's work.  What you   \nneed to do is discover what you like.  You have to work on stuff  \nyou like if you want to be good at what you do.<br/><br/>It might seem that nothing would be easier than deciding what you\nlike, but it turns out to be hard, partly because it's hard to get\nan accurate picture of most jobs.  Being a doctor is not the way\nit's portrayed on TV.  Fortunately you can also watch real doctors,\nby volunteering in hospitals. [1]<br/><br/>But there are other jobs you can't learn about, because no one is\ndoing them yet.  Most of the work I've done in the last ten years\ndidn't exist when I was in high school.  The world changes fast,  \nand the rate at which it changes is itself speeding up.  In such a\nworld it's not a good idea to have fixed plans.<br/><br/>And yet every May, speakers all over the country fire up the Standard \nGraduation Speech, the theme of which is: don't give up on your\ndreams.  I know what they mean, but this is a bad way to put it,\nbecause it implies you're supposed to be bound by some plan you\nmade early on.  The computer world has a name for this: premature\noptimization.  And it is synonymous with disaster.  These speakers\nwould do better to say simply, don't give up.<br/><br/>What they really mean is, don't get demoralized.  Don't think that   \nyou can't do what other people can.   And I agree you shouldn't  \nunderestimate your potential.  People who've done great things tend\nto seem as if they were a race apart.  And most biographies only   \nexaggerate this illusion, partly due to the worshipful attitude   \nbiographers inevitably sink into, and partly because, knowing how\nthe story ends, they can't help streamlining the plot till it seems\nlike the subject's life was a matter of destiny, the mere unfolding\nof some innate genius.   In fact I suspect if you had the sixteen\nyear old Shakespeare or Einstein in school with you, they'd seem\nimpressive, but not totally unlike your other friends.<br/><br/>Which is an uncomfortable thought.  If they were just like us, then\nthey had to work very hard to do what they did.  And that's one  \nreason we like to believe in genius.  It gives us an excuse for\nbeing lazy.  If these guys were able to do what they did only because\nof some magic Shakespeareness or Einsteinness, then it's not our\nfault if we can't do something as good.<br/><br/>I'm not saying there's no such thing as genius.  But if you're\ntrying to choose between two theories and one gives you an excuse \nfor being lazy, the other one is probably right.<br/><br/>So far we've cut the Standard Graduation Speech down from \"don't\ngive up on your dreams\" to \"what someone else can do, you can do.\"\nBut it needs to be cut still further.  There is <i>some</i> variation\nin natural ability.  Most people overestimate its role, but it does  \nexist.  If I were talking to a guy four feet tall whose ambition \nwas to play in the NBA, I'd feel pretty stupid saying, you can\ndo anything if you really try. [2]<br/><br/>We need to cut the Standard Graduation Speech down to, \"what someone\nelse with your abilities can do, you can do; and don't underestimate\nyour abilities.\"  But as so often happens, the closer you get to\nthe truth, the messier your sentence gets.  We've taken a nice, \nneat (but wrong) slogan, and churned it up like a mud puddle.  It\ndoesn't make a very good speech anymore.  But worse still, it doesn't\ntell you what to do anymore.  Someone with your abilities?  What  \nare your abilities?<br/><br/><b>Upwind</b><br/><br/>I think the solution is to work in the other direction.  Instead\nof working back from a goal, work forward from promising situations.\nThis is what most successful people actually do anyway.<br/><br/>In the graduation-speech approach, you decide where you want to be\nin twenty years, and then ask: what should I do now to get there?  \nI propose instead that you don't commit to anything in the future,\nbut just look at the options available now, and choose those that\nwill give you the most promising range of options afterward.<br/><br/>It's not so important what you work on, so long as you're not wasting\nyour time.  Work on things that interest you and increase your\noptions, and worry later about which you'll take.<br/><br/>Suppose you're a college freshman deciding whether to major in math   \nor economics.  Well, math will give you more options: you can go into\nalmost any field from math.  If you major in math it will be easy\nto get into grad school in economics, but if you major in economics\nit will be hard to get into grad school in math.<br/><br/>Flying a glider is a good metaphor here.  Because a glider doesn't\nhave an engine, you can't fly into the wind without losing a lot\nof altitude.  If you let yourself get far downwind of good places    \nto land, your options narrow uncomfortably.  As a rule you want to\nstay upwind.  So I propose that as a replacement for \"don't give   \nup on your dreams.\"  Stay upwind.<br/><br/>How do you do that, though?  Even if math is upwind of economics,\nhow are you supposed to know that as a high school student?<br/><br/>Well, you don't, and that's what you need to find out.  <!-- I can give\nyou some tips on how to recognize upwind. --> Look for smart people\nand hard problems.  Smart people tend to clump together, and if you\ncan find such a clump, it's probably worthwhile to join it.  But\nit's not straightforward to find these, because there is a lot of  \nfaking going on.<br/><br/>To a newly arrived undergraduate, all university departments look\nmuch the same.  The professors all seem forbiddingly intellectual\nand publish papers unintelligible to outsiders.  But while in some\nfields the papers are unintelligible because they're full of hard\nideas, in others they're deliberately written in an obscure way to\nseem as if they're saying something important.  This may seem a   \nscandalous proposition, but it has been experimentally verified,\nin the famous <i>Social Text</i> affair.  Suspecting that the papers\npublished by literary theorists were often just intellectual-sounding\nnonsense, a physicist deliberately wrote a paper full of\nintellectual-sounding nonsense, and submitted it to a literary\ntheory journal, which published it.<br/><br/>The best protection is always to be working on hard problems.   \nWriting novels is hard.  Reading novels isn't. \nHard means worry: if you're not worrying that\nsomething you're making will come out badly, or that you won't be \nable to understand something you're studying, then it isn't hard\nenough.  There has to be suspense.<br/><br/>Well, this seems a grim view of the world, you may think.  What I'm\ntelling you is that you should worry?  Yes, but it's not as bad as\nit sounds.  It's exhilarating to overcome worries.  You don't see\nfaces much happier than people winning gold medals.  And you know\nwhy they're so happy?  Relief.<br/><br/>I'm not saying this is the only way to be happy.  Just that some\nkinds of worry are not as bad as they sound.<br/><br/><b>Ambition</b><br/><br/>In practice, \"stay upwind\" reduces to \"work on hard problems.\"  And  \nyou can start today.  I wish I'd grasped that in\nhigh school.<br/><br/>Most people like to be good at what they do.  In the so-called real  \nworld this need is a powerful force.  But high school students\nrarely benefit from it, because they're given a fake thing to do.  \nWhen I was in high school, I let myself believe that my job was to \nbe a high school student.  And so I let my need to be good at what \nI did be satisfied by merely doing well in school.<br/><br/>If you'd asked me in high school what the difference was between\nhigh school kids and adults, I'd have said it was that adults had \nto earn a living.  Wrong.  It's that adults take responsibility for\nthemselves.  Making a living is only a small part of it.\nFar more important is to take intellectual responsibility for oneself.<br/><br/>If I had to go through high school again, I'd treat it like a day\njob.  I don't mean that I'd slack in school.  Working at something\nas a day job doesn't mean doing it badly.  It means not being defined\nby it.  I mean I wouldn't think of myself as a high school student,\njust as a musician with a day job as a waiter doesn't think of   \nhimself as a waiter. [3]   And when I wasn't working at my day job\nI'd start trying to do real work.<br/><br/>When I ask people what they regret most about high school, they\nnearly all say the same thing: that they wasted so much time.  If\nyou're wondering what you're doing now that you'll regret most\nlater, that's probably it. [4]<br/><br/>Some people say this is inevitable â€” that high school students\naren't capable of getting anything done yet.  But I don't think\nthis is true.  And the proof is that you're bored.  You probably\nweren't bored when you were eight.  When you're eight it's called\n\"playing\" instead of \"hanging out,\" but it's the same thing.  And\nwhen I was eight, I was rarely bored.  Give me a back yard and a\nfew other kids and I could play all day.<br/><br/>The reason this got stale in middle school and high school, I now\nrealize, is that I was ready for something else.  Childhood was\ngetting old.<br/><br/>I'm not saying you shouldn't hang out with your friends â€” that you\nshould all become humorless little robots who do nothing but work.\nHanging out with friends is like chocolate cake.  You enjoy it more\nif you eat it occasionally than if you eat nothing but chocolate  \ncake for every meal.  No matter how much you like chocolate cake,\nyou'll be pretty queasy after the third meal of it.  And that's  \nwhat the malaise one feels in high school is: mental queasiness.\n[5]<br/><br/>You may be thinking, we have to do more than get good grades.  We\nhave to have <i>extracurricular activities.</i>  But you know\nperfectly well how bogus most of these are.  Collecting donations\nfor a charity is an admirable thing to do, but it's not <i>hard.</i>\nIt's not getting something done.  What I mean by getting something\ndone is learning how to write well, or how to program computers,\nor what life was really like in preindustrial societies, or how to   \ndraw the human face from life.  This sort of thing rarely translates\ninto a line item on a college application.<br/><br/><b>Corruption</b><br/><br/>It's dangerous to design your life around getting into college,  \nbecause the people you have to impress to get into college are not \na very discerning audience.  At most colleges, it's not the professors\nwho decide whether you get in, but admissions officers, and they\nare nowhere near as smart.  They're the NCOs of the intellectual\nworld. They can't tell how smart you are.\nThe mere existence of prep schools is proof of that.<br/><br/>Few parents\nwould pay so much for their kids to go to a school that didn't \nimprove their admissions prospects.  Prep schools openly say this\nis one of their aims.  But what that means, if you stop to \nthink about it, is that they can\nhack the admissions process: that they can take the very same kid\nand make him seem a more appealing candidate than he would if he  \nwent to the local public school. [6]<br/><br/>Right now most of you feel your job in life is to be a promising\ncollege applicant.  But that means you're designing your life to\nsatisfy a process so mindless that there's a whole industry devoted\nto subverting it.  No wonder you become cynical.  The malaise you\nfeel is the same that a producer of reality TV shows or a tobacco \nindustry executive feels.  And you don't even get paid a lot.<br/><br/>So what do you do?  What you should not do is rebel.  That's what\nI did, and it was a mistake.  I didn't realize exactly what was   \nhappening to us, but I smelled a major rat.  And so I just gave up.\nObviously the world sucked, so why bother?<br/><br/>When I discovered that one of our teachers was herself using Cliff's\nNotes, it seemed par for the course.  Surely it meant nothing to\nget a good grade in such a class.<br/><br/>In retrospect this was stupid.  It was like someone getting fouled\nin a soccer game and saying, hey, you fouled me, that's against the\nrules, and walking off the field in indignation.  Fouls happen. \nThe thing to do when you get fouled is not to lose your cool.  Just\nkeep playing.  <!-- Don't even foul the guy back; if you really want  \nrevenge, you'll make him more unhappy by winning the game than by\nelbowing him in the jaw. --><br/><br/>By putting you in this situation, society has fouled you.   Yes, \nas you suspect, a lot of the stuff you learn in your classes is   \ncrap.  And yes, as you suspect, the college admissions process is\nlargely a charade.  But like many fouls, this one was unintentional.\n[7] So just keep playing.<br/><br/>Rebellion is almost as stupid as obedience.  In either case you let\nyourself be defined by what they tell you to do.  The best plan, I\nthink, is to step onto an orthogonal vector.  Don't just do what \nthey tell you, and don't just refuse to.  Instead treat school as\na day job.  As day jobs go, it's pretty sweet.  You're done at 3\no'clock, and you can even work on your own stuff while you're there.<br/><br/><b>Curiosity</b><br/><br/>And what's your real job supposed to be?  Unless you're Mozart,   \nyour first task is to figure that out.  What are the great things\nto work on?  Where are the imaginative people?  And most importantly,\nwhat are you interested in?  The word \"aptitude\" is misleading,\nbecause it implies something innate.  The most powerful sort of\naptitude is a consuming interest in some question, and such interests\nare often acquired tastes.<br/><br/>A distorted version of this idea has filtered into popular culture\nunder the name \"passion.\"  I recently saw an ad for waiters saying\nthey wanted people with a \"passion for service.\"  The real thing \nis not something one could have for waiting on tables.  And passion\nis a bad word for it. A better name would be curiosity.<br/><br/>Kids are curious, but the curiosity I mean has a different shape from kid\ncuriosity.  Kid curiosity is broad and shallow; they ask why at\nrandom about everything.  In most adults this curiosity dries up\nentirely.  It has to: you can't get anything done if you're always\nasking why about everything.  But in ambitious adults, instead of\ndrying up, curiosity becomes narrow and deep.  The mud flat morphs\ninto a well.<br/><br/>Curiosity turns work into play.  For Einstein, relativity wasn't a\nbook full of hard stuff he had to learn for an exam.  It was a\nmystery he was trying to solve.  So it probably felt like less work\nto him to invent it than it would seem to someone now to learn it\nin a class.<br/><br/>One of the most dangerous illusions you get from school is the idea\nthat doing great things requires a lot of discipline.  Most subjects\nare taught in such a boring way that it's only by discipline that\nyou can flog yourself through them.  So I was surprised when, early\nin college, I read a quote by Wittgenstein saying that he had no \nself-discipline and had never been able to deny himself anything, \nnot even a cup of coffee.<br/><br/>Now I know a number of people who do great work, and it's the same\nwith all of them.  They have little discipline.  They're all terrible\nprocrastinators and find it almost impossible to make themselves\ndo anything they're not interested in.  One still hasn't sent out\nhis half of the thank-you notes from his wedding, four years ago.\nAnother has 26,000 emails in her inbox.<br/><br/>I'm not saying you can get away with zero self-discipline.  You \nprobably need about the amount you need to go running.  I'm often  \nreluctant to go running, but once I do, I enjoy it.  And if I don't  \nrun for several days, I feel ill.  It's the same with people who \ndo great things.  They know they'll feel bad if they don't work,\nand they have enough discipline to get themselves to their desks\nto start working.  But once they get started, interest takes over,\nand discipline is no longer necessary.<br/><br/>Do you think Shakespeare was gritting his teeth and diligently\ntrying to write Great Literature?  Of course not.  He was having\nfun.  That's why he's so good.<br/><br/>If you want to do good work, what you need is a great curiosity   \nabout a promising question.   The critical moment for Einstein\nwas when he looked at Maxwell's equations and said, what the hell\nis going on here?<br/><br/>It can take years to zero in on a productive question, because it\ncan take years to figure out what a subject is really about.  To\ntake an extreme example, consider math.  Most people think they\nhate math, but the boring stuff you do in school under the name\n\"mathematics\" is not at all like what mathematicians do.<br/><br/>The great mathematician G. H.  Hardy said he didn't like math in \nhigh school either.  He only took it up because he was better at\nit than the other students.  Only later did he realize math was\ninteresting â€” only later did he start to ask questions instead of\nmerely answering them correctly.<br/><br/>When a friend of mine used to grumble because he had to write a\npaper for school, his mother would tell him: find a way to make it\ninteresting.  That's what you need to do: find a question that makes\nthe world interesting.  People who do great things look at the same\nworld everyone else does, but notice some odd detail that's\ncompellingly mysterious.<br/><br/>And not only in intellectual matters.  Henry Ford's great question \nwas, why do cars have to be a luxury item?  What would happen if\nyou treated them as a commodity?  Franz Beckenbauer's was, in effect,\nwhy does everyone have to stay in his position?  Why can't defenders\nscore goals too?<br/><br/><b>Now</b><br/><br/>If it takes years to articulate great questions, what do you do now,\nat sixteen?  Work toward finding one.  Great questions don't appear\nsuddenly.  They gradually congeal in your head.  And what makes\nthem congeal is experience.  So the way to find great questions is\nnot to search for them â€” not to wander about thinking, what great  \ndiscovery shall I make?  You can't answer that; if you could, you'd \nhave made it.<br/><br/>The way to get a big idea to appear in your head is not to hunt for\nbig ideas, but to put in a lot of time on work that interests you,\nand in the process keep your mind open enough that a big idea can\ntake roost.  Einstein, Ford, and Beckenbauer all used this recipe.\nThey all knew their work like a piano player knows the keys.  So  \nwhen something seemed amiss to them, they had the confidence to\nnotice it.<br/><br/>Put in time how and on what?  Just pick a project that seems\ninteresting: to master some chunk of material, or to make something,\nor to answer some question.  Choose a project that will take less\nthan a month, and make it something you have the means to finish.\nDo something hard enough to stretch you, but only just, especially \nat first.  If you're deciding between two projects, choose whichever \nseems most fun. If one blows up in your face, start another.  Repeat\ntill, like an internal combustion engine, the process becomes   \nself-sustaining, and each project generates the next one.  (This\ncould take years.)<br/><br/>It may be just as well not to do a project \"for school,\" if that\nwill restrict you or make it seem like work.  Involve your friends\nif you want, but not too many, and only if they're not flakes.  \nFriends offer moral support (few startups are started by one person),\nbut secrecy also has its advantages.  There's something pleasing\nabout a secret project.  And you can take more risks, because no  \none will know if you fail.<br/><br/>Don't worry if a project doesn't seem to be on the path to some\ngoal you're supposed to have. Paths can bend a lot more than you\nthink.  So let the path grow out the project.  The most important\nthing is to be excited about it, because it's by doing that you \nlearn.<br/><br/>Don't disregard unseemly motivations.  One of the most powerful is\nthe desire to be better than other people at something.  Hardy said\nthat's what got him started, and I think the only unusual thing  \nabout him is that he admitted it.  Another powerful motivator is\nthe desire to do, or know, things you're not supposed to.  Closely\nrelated is the desire to do something audacious.  Sixteen year olds\naren't supposed to write novels.  So if you try, anything you achieve\nis on the plus side of the ledger; if you fail utterly, you're doing\nno worse than expectations.  [8]<br/><br/>Beware of bad models.  Especially when they excuse laziness.  When  \nI was in high school I used to write \"existentialist\" short stories\nlike ones I'd seen by famous writers.  My stories didn't have a lot\nof plot, but they were very deep.  And they were less work to write\nthan entertaining ones would have been.  I should have known that\nwas a danger sign.  And in fact I found my stories pretty boring;  \nwhat excited me was the idea of writing serious, intellectual stuff\nlike the famous writers.<br/><br/>Now I have enough experience to realize that those famous writers\nactually sucked.  Plenty of famous people do; in the short term,\nthe quality of one's work is only a small component of fame.  \nI should have been less worried about doing something\nthat seemed cool, and just done something I liked.  That's the\nactual road to coolness anyway.<br/><br/>A key ingredient in many projects, almost a project on its own, is \nto find good books.  Most books are bad.  Nearly all textbooks are\nbad. [9]  So don't assume a subject is to be learned from whatever\nbook on it happens to be closest.  You have to search actively for \nthe tiny number of good books.<br/><br/>The important thing is to get out there and do stuff.  Instead of\nwaiting to be taught, go out and learn.<br/><br/>Your life doesn't have to be shaped by admissions officers.  It  \ncould be shaped by your own curiosity.  It is for all ambitious   \nadults.  And you don't have to wait to start.  In fact, you don't \nhave to wait to be an adult.  There's no switch inside you that\nmagically flips when you turn a certain age or graduate from some\ninstitution.  You start being an adult when you decide to take\nresponsibility for your life.  You can do that at any age.  [10]<br/><br/>This may sound like bullshit.  I'm just a minor, you may think, I\nhave no money, I have to live at home, I have to do what adults  \ntell me all day long.  Well, most adults labor under restrictions  \njust as cumbersome, and they manage to get things done.  If you\nthink it's restrictive being a kid, imagine having kids.<br/><br/>The only real difference between adults and high school kids is\nthat adults realize they need to get things done, and high school\nkids don't.  That realization hits most people around 23.  But I'm\nletting you in on the secret early.  So get to work.  Maybe you can\nbe the first generation whose greatest regret from high school isn't\nhow much time you wasted.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[1] A doctor friend warns that even this can give an inaccurate \npicture. \"Who knew how much time it would take up, how little\nautonomy one would have for endless years of training, and how\nunbelievably annoying it is to carry a beeper?\"<br/><br/>[2] His best bet would probably be to become dictator and intimidate\nthe NBA into letting him play.  So far the closest anyone has come\nis Secretary of Labor.<br/><br/>[3] A day job is one you take to pay the bills so you can do what\nyou really want, like play in a band, or invent relativity.<br/><br/>Treating high school as a day job might actually make it easier for\nsome students to get good grades.  If you treat your classes\nas a game, you won't be demoralized if they seem pointless.<br/><br/>However bad your classes, you need to get good grades in them to   \nget into a decent college.  And that <i>is</i> worth doing, because\nuniversities are where a lot of the clumps of smart people are these\ndays.<br/><br/>[4] The second biggest regret was caring so much about unimportant\nthings.  And especially about what other people thought of them.<br/><br/>I think what they really mean, in the latter case, is caring what\nrandom people thought of them.  Adults care just as much what other\npeople think, but they get to be more selective about the other\npeople.<br/><br/>I have about thirty friends whose opinions I care about,\nand the opinion of the rest of the world barely affects me.  The\nproblem in high school is that your peers are chosen for you by    \naccidents of age and geography, rather than by you based on respect\nfor their judgement.<br/><br/>[5] The key to wasting time is distraction.  Without distractions\nit's too obvious to your brain that you're not doing anything with\nit, and you start to feel uncomfortable.  If you want to measure \nhow dependent you've become on distractions, try this experiment:\nset aside a chunk of time on a weekend and sit alone and think.\nYou can have a notebook to write your thoughts down in, but nothing\nelse: no friends, TV, music, phone, IM, email, Web, games, books, \nnewspapers, or magazines.  Within an hour most people will feel a \nstrong craving for distraction.<br/><br/>[6] I don't mean to imply that the only function of prep schools\nis to trick admissions officers.  They also generally provide a \nbetter education.  But try this thought experiment: suppose prep\nschools supplied the same superior education but had a tiny (.001)\nnegative effect on college admissions.  How many parents would still\nsend their kids to them?<br/><br/>It might also be argued that kids who went to prep schools, because\nthey've learned more, <i>are</i> better college candidates.  But\nthis seems empirically false.  What you learn in even the best high\nschool is rounding error compared to what you learn in college.  \nPublic school kids arrive at college with a slight disadvantage,  \nbut they start to pull ahead in the sophomore year.<br/><br/>(I'm not saying public school kids are smarter than preppies, just\nthat they are within any given college.  That follows necessarily\nif you agree prep schools improve kids' admissions prospects.)<br/><br/>[7] Why does society foul you?  Indifference, mainly.  There are\nsimply no outside forces pushing high school to be good.  The air\ntraffic control system works because planes would crash otherwise.\nBusinesses have to deliver because otherwise competitors would take\ntheir customers.  But no planes crash if your school sucks, and it\nhas no competitors.  High school isn't evil; it's random; but random\nis pretty bad.<br/><br/>[8] And then of course there is money.  It's not a big factor in\nhigh school, because you can't do much that anyone wants.  But a\nlot of great things were created mainly to make money.  Samuel\nJohnson said \"no man but a blockhead ever wrote except for money.\"\n(Many hope he was exaggerating.)<br/><br/>[9] Even college textbooks are bad.  When you get to college,\nyou'll find that (with a few stellar exceptions) the textbooks are\nnot written by the leading scholars in the field they describe.\nWriting college textbooks is unpleasant work, done mostly by people\nwho need the money.  It's unpleasant because the publishers exert\nso much control, and there are few things worse than close supervision\nby someone who doesn't understand what you're doing.  This phenomenon\nis apparently \n<a href=\"http://www.edutopia.org/muddle-machine\">even worse</a> in the production of high school textbooks.<br/><br/>[10] Your teachers are always telling you to behave like adults.\nI wonder if they'd like it if you did.  You may be loud and\ndisorganized, but you're very docile compared to adults.  If you\nactually started acting like adults, it would be just as if a bunch\nof adults had been transposed into your bodies.  Imagine the reaction\nof an FBI agent or taxi driver or reporter to being told they had\nto ask permission to go the bathroom, and only one person could go\nat a time.  To say nothing of the things you're taught.  If a bunch\nof actual adults suddenly found themselves trapped in high school,\nthe first thing they'd do is form a union and renegotiate all the\nrules with the administration.<br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Ingrid Bassett, Trevor Blackwell, \nRich Draves, Dan Giffin, Sarah\nHarlin, Jessica Livingston, Jackie McDonough, Robert Morris, Mark Nitzberg, Lisa \nRandall, and Aaron Swartz for reading drafts of this, and to many\nothers for talking to me about high school.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
