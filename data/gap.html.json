{"href":"gap.html","title":"Mind the Gap","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">May 2004<br/><br/>When people care enough about something to do it well, those who\ndo it best tend to be far better than everyone else.  There's a\nhuge gap between Leonardo and second-rate contemporaries like\nBorgognone.  You see the same gap between Raymond Chandler and the\naverage writer of detective novels.  A top-ranked professional chess\nplayer could play ten thousand games against an ordinary club player\nwithout losing once.<br/><br/>Like chess or painting or writing novels, making money is a very\nspecialized skill.   But for some reason we treat this skill\ndifferently.  No one complains when a few people surpass all the\nrest at playing chess or writing novels, but when a few people make\nmore money than the rest, we get editorials saying this is wrong.<br/><br/>Why?  The pattern of variation seems no different than for any other\nskill.  What causes people to react so strongly when the skill is\nmaking money?<br/><br/>I think there are three reasons we treat making money as different:\nthe misleading model of wealth we learn as children; the disreputable\nway in which, till recently, most fortunes were accumulated; and\nthe worry that great variations in income are somehow bad for\nsociety.  As far as I can tell, the first is mistaken, the second\noutdated, and the third empirically false.  Could it be that, in a\nmodern democracy, variation in income is actually a sign of health?<br/><br/><b>The Daddy Model of Wealth</b><br/><br/>When I was five I thought electricity was created by electric\nsockets.  I didn't realize there were power plants out there\ngenerating it.  Likewise, it doesn't occur to most kids that wealth\nis something that has to be generated.  It seems to be something\nthat flows from parents.<br/><br/>Because of the circumstances in which they encounter it, children\ntend to misunderstand wealth.  They confuse it with money.  They\nthink that there is a fixed amount of it.  And they think of it as\nsomething that's distributed by authorities (and so should be\ndistributed equally), rather than something that has to be created\n(and might be created unequally).<br/><br/>In fact, wealth is not money.  Money is just a convenient way of\ntrading one form of wealth for another.  Wealth is the underlying\nstuff—the goods and services we buy.  When you travel to a\nrich or poor country, you don't have to look at people's bank\naccounts to tell which kind you're in.  You can <i>see</i>\nwealth—in buildings and streets, in the clothes and the health\nof the people.<br/><br/>Where does wealth come from?  People make it.  This was easier to\ngrasp when most people lived on farms, and made many of the things\nthey wanted with their own hands.  Then you could see in the house,\nthe herds, and the granary the wealth that each family created.  It\nwas obvious then too that the wealth of the world was not a fixed\nquantity that had to be shared out, like slices of a pie.  If you\nwanted more wealth, you could make it.<br/><br/>This is just as true today, though few of us create wealth directly\nfor ourselves (except for a few vestigial domestic tasks).  Mostly\nwe create wealth for other people in exchange for money, which we\nthen trade for the forms of wealth we want. \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f1n\"><font color=\"#777777\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Because kids are unable to create wealth, whatever they have has\nto be given to them.  And when wealth is something you're given,\nthen of course it seems that it should be distributed equally.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f2n\"><font color=\"#777777\">2</font></a>]</font>\nAs in most families it is.  The kids see to that.  \"Unfair,\" they\ncry, when one sibling gets more than another.<br/><br/>In the real world, you can't keep living off your parents.  If you\nwant something, you either have to make it, or do something of\nequivalent value for someone else, in order to get them to give you\nenough money to buy it.  In the real world, wealth is (except for\na few specialists like thieves and speculators) something you have\nto create, not something that's distributed by Daddy.  And since\nthe ability and desire to create it vary from person to person,\nit's not made equally.<br/><br/>You get paid by doing or making something people want, and those\nwho make more money are often simply better at doing what people\nwant.  Top actors make a lot more money than B-list actors.  The\nB-list actors might be almost as charismatic, but when people go\nto the theater and look at the list of movies playing, they want\nthat extra oomph that the big stars have.<br/><br/>Doing what people want is not the only way to get money, of course.\nYou could also rob banks, or solicit bribes, or establish a monopoly.\nSuch tricks account for some variation in wealth, and indeed for\nsome of the biggest individual fortunes, but they are not the root\ncause of variation in income.  The root cause of variation in income,\nas Occam's Razor implies, is the same as the root cause of variation\nin every other human skill.<br/><br/>In the United States, the CEO of a large public company makes about\n100 times as much as the average person. \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f3n\"><font color=\"#777777\">3</font></a>]</font>\nBasketball players\nmake about 128 times as much, and baseball players 72 times as much.\nEditorials quote this kind of statistic with horror.  But I have\nno trouble imagining that one person could be 100 times as productive\nas another.  In ancient Rome the price of <i>slaves</i> varied by\na factor of 50 depending on their skills. \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f4n\"><font color=\"#777777\">4</font></a>]</font>\nAnd that's without\nconsidering motivation, or the extra leverage in productivity that\nyou can get from modern technology.<br/><br/>Editorials about athletes' or CEOs' salaries remind me of early\nChristian writers, arguing from first principles about whether the\nEarth was round, when they could just walk outside and check.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f5n\"><font color=\"#777777\">5</font></a>]</font>\nHow much someone's work is worth is not a policy question.  It's\nsomething the market already determines.<br/><br/>\"Are they really worth 100 of us?\" editorialists ask.  Depends on\nwhat you mean by worth.  If you mean worth in the sense of what\npeople will pay for their skills, the answer is yes, apparently.<br/><br/>A few CEOs' incomes reflect some kind of wrongdoing.  But are there\nnot others whose incomes really do reflect the wealth they generate?\nSteve Jobs saved a company that was in a terminal decline.  And not\nmerely in the way a turnaround specialist does, by cutting costs;\nhe had to decide what Apple's next products should be.  Few others\ncould have done it.  And regardless of the case with CEOs, it's\nhard to see how anyone could argue that the salaries of professional\nbasketball players don't reflect supply and demand.<br/><br/>It may seem unlikely in principle that one individual could really\ngenerate so much more wealth than another.  The key to this mystery\nis to revisit that question, are they really worth 100 of us?\n<i>Would</i> a basketball team trade one of their players for 100\nrandom people?  What would Apple's next product look like if you\nreplaced Steve Jobs with a committee of 100 random people? \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f6n\"><font color=\"#777777\">6</font></a>]</font>\nThese\nthings don't scale linearly.  Perhaps the CEO or the professional\nathlete has only ten times (whatever that means) the skill and\ndetermination of an ordinary person.  But it makes all the difference\nthat it's concentrated in one individual.<br/><br/>When we say that one kind of work is overpaid and another underpaid,\nwhat are we really saying?  In a free market, prices are determined\nby what buyers want.  People like baseball more than  poetry, so\nbaseball players make more than poets.  To say that a certain kind\nof work is underpaid is thus identical with saying that people want\nthe wrong things.<br/><br/>Well, of course people want the wrong things.  It seems odd to be\nsurprised by that.  And it seems even odder to say that it's\n<i>unjust</i> that certain kinds of work are underpaid. \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f7n\"><font color=\"#777777\">7</font></a>]</font>\nThen\nyou're saying that it's unjust that people want the wrong things.\nIt's  lamentable that people prefer reality TV and corndogs to\nShakespeare and steamed vegetables, but unjust?  That seems like\nsaying that blue is heavy, or that up is circular.<br/><br/>The appearance of the word \"unjust\" here is the unmistakable spectral\nsignature of the Daddy Model.  Why else would this idea occur in\nthis odd context?  Whereas if the speaker were still operating on\nthe Daddy Model, and saw wealth as something that flowed from a\ncommon source and had to be shared out, rather than something\ngenerated by doing what other people wanted, this is exactly what\nyou'd get on noticing that some people made much more than others.<br/><br/>When we talk about \"unequal distribution of income,\" we should\nalso ask, where does that income come from?\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f8n\"><font color=\"#777777\">8</font></a>]</font>\nWho made the wealth\nit represents?  Because to the extent that income varies simply\naccording to how much wealth people create, the distribution may\nbe unequal, but it's hardly unjust.<br/><br/><b>Stealing It</b><br/><br/>The second reason we tend to find great disparities of wealth\nalarming is that for most of human history the usual way to accumulate\na fortune was to steal it: in pastoral societies by cattle raiding;\nin agricultural societies by appropriating others' estates in times\nof war, and taxing them in times of peace.<br/><br/>In conflicts, those on the winning side would receive the estates\nconfiscated from the losers.  In England in the 1060s, when William\nthe Conqueror distributed the estates of the defeated Anglo-Saxon\nnobles to his followers, the conflict was military.  By the 1530s,\nwhen Henry VIII distributed the estates of the monasteries to his\nfollowers, it was mostly political. \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f9n\"><font color=\"#777777\">9</font></a>]</font>\nBut the principle was the\nsame.  Indeed, the same principle is at work now in Zimbabwe.<br/><br/>In more organized societies, like China, the ruler and his officials\nused taxation instead of confiscation.  But here too we see the\nsame principle: the way to get rich was not to create wealth, but\nto serve a ruler powerful enough to appropriate it.<br/><br/>This started to change in Europe with the rise of the middle class.\nNow we think of the middle class as people who are neither rich nor\npoor, but originally they were a distinct group.  In a feudal\nsociety, there are just two classes: a warrior aristocracy, and the\nserfs who work their estates.  The middle class were a new, third\ngroup who lived in towns and supported themselves by manufacturing\nand trade.<br/><br/>Starting in the tenth and eleventh centuries, petty nobles and\nformer serfs banded together in towns that gradually became powerful\nenough to ignore the local feudal lords. \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f10n\"><font color=\"#777777\">10</font></a>]</font>\nLike serfs, the middle\nclass made a living largely by creating wealth.  (In port cities\nlike Genoa and Pisa, they also engaged in piracy.) But unlike serfs\nthey had an incentive to create a lot of it.  Any wealth a serf\ncreated belonged to his master.  There was not much point in making\nmore than you could hide.  Whereas the independence of the townsmen\nallowed them to keep whatever wealth they created.<br/><br/>Once it became possible to get rich by creating wealth, society as\na whole started to get richer very rapidly.  Nearly everything we\nhave was created by the middle class.  Indeed, the other two classes\nhave effectively disappeared in industrial societies, and their\nnames been given to either end of the middle class.  (In the original\nsense of the word, Bill Gates is middle class.)<br/><br/>But it was not till the Industrial Revolution that wealth creation\ndefinitively replaced corruption as the best way to get rich.  In\nEngland, at least, corruption only became unfashionable (and in\nfact only started to be called \"corruption\") when there started to\nbe other, faster ways to get rich.<br/><br/>Seventeenth-century England was much like the third world today,\nin that government office was a recognized route to wealth.  The\ngreat fortunes of that time still derived more from what we would\nnow call corruption than from commerce. \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f11n\"><font color=\"#777777\">11</font></a>]</font>\nBy the nineteenth\ncentury that had changed.  There continued to be bribes, as there\nstill are everywhere, but politics had by then been left to men who\nwere driven more by vanity than greed.  Technology had made it\npossible to create wealth faster than you could steal it.  The\nprototypical rich man of the nineteenth century was not a courtier\nbut an industrialist.<br/><br/>With the rise of the middle class, wealth stopped being a zero-sum\ngame.  Jobs and Wozniak didn't have to make us poor to make themselves\nrich.  Quite the opposite: they created things that made our lives\nmaterially richer.  They had to, or we wouldn't have paid for them.<br/><br/>But since for most of the world's history the main route to wealth\nwas to steal it, we tend to be suspicious of rich people.  Idealistic\nundergraduates find their unconsciously preserved child's model of\nwealth confirmed by eminent writers of the past.  It is a case of\nthe mistaken meeting the outdated.<br/><br/>\"Behind every great fortune, there is a crime,\" Balzac wrote.  Except\nhe didn't.  What he actually said was that a great fortune with no\napparent cause was probably due to a crime well enough executed\nthat it had been forgotten.  If we were talking about Europe in\n1000, or most of the third world today, the standard misquotation\nwould be spot on.  But Balzac lived in nineteenth-century France,\nwhere the Industrial Revolution was well advanced.  He knew you\ncould make a fortune without stealing it.  After all, he did himself,\nas a popular novelist.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f12n\"><font color=\"#777777\">12</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Only a few countries (by no coincidence, the richest ones) have\nreached this stage.  In most, corruption still has the upper hand.\nIn most, the fastest way to get wealth is by stealing it.  And so\nwhen we see increasing differences in income in a rich country,\nthere is a tendency to worry that it's sliding back toward becoming\nanother Venezuela.  I think the opposite is happening. I think\nyou're seeing a country a full step ahead of Venezuela.<br/><br/><b>The Lever of Technology</b><br/><br/>Will technology increase the gap between rich and poor?  It will\ncertainly increase the gap between the productive and the unproductive.\nThat's the whole point of technology.   With a tractor an energetic\nfarmer could plow six times as much land in a day as he could with\na team of horses.  But only if he mastered a new kind of farming.<br/><br/>I've seen the lever of technology grow visibly in my own time.  In\nhigh school I made money by mowing lawns and scooping ice cream at\nBaskin-Robbins.  This was the only kind of work available at the\ntime.  Now high school kids could write software or design web\nsites.  But only some of them will; the rest will still be scooping\nice cream.<br/><br/>I remember very vividly when in 1985 improved technology made it\npossible for me to buy a computer of my own.  Within months I was\nusing it to make money as a freelance programmer.  A few years\nbefore, I couldn't have done this.  A few years before, there was\nno such <i>thing</i> as a freelance programmer.  But Apple created\nwealth, in the form of powerful, inexpensive computers, and programmers\nimmediately set to work using it to create more.<br/><br/>As this example suggests, the rate at which technology increases\nour productive capacity is probably exponential, rather than linear.\nSo we should expect to see ever-increasing variation in individual\nproductivity as time goes on.   Will that increase the gap between\nrich and the poor?  Depends which gap you mean.<br/><br/>Technology should increase the gap in income, but it seems to\ndecrease other gaps.  A hundred years ago, the rich led a different\n<i>kind</i> of life from ordinary people.  They lived in houses\nfull of servants, wore elaborately uncomfortable clothes, and\ntravelled about in carriages drawn by teams of horses which themselves\nrequired their own houses and servants.  Now, thanks to technology,\nthe rich live more like the average person.<br/><br/>Cars are a good example of why.  It's possible to buy expensive,\nhandmade cars that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.  But there\nis not much point.  Companies make more money by building a large\nnumber of ordinary cars than a small number of expensive ones.  So\na company making a mass-produced car can afford to spend a lot more\non its design.  If you buy a custom-made car, something will always\nbe breaking.  The only point of buying one now is to advertise that\nyou can.<br/><br/>Or consider watches.  Fifty years ago, by spending a lot of money\non a watch you could get better performance.  When watches had\nmechanical movements, expensive watches kept better time.  Not any\nmore.  Since the invention of the quartz movement, an ordinary Timex\nis more accurate than a Patek Philippe costing hundreds of thousands\nof dollars.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f13n\"><font color=\"#777777\">13</font></a>]</font>\nIndeed, as with expensive cars, if you're determined\nto spend a lot of money on a watch, you have to put up with some\ninconvenience to do it: as well as keeping worse time, mechanical\nwatches have to be wound.<br/><br/>The only thing technology can't cheapen is brand.  Which is precisely\nwhy we hear ever more about it.  Brand is the residue left as the\nsubstantive differences between rich and poor evaporate.  But what\nlabel you have on your stuff is a much smaller matter than having\nit versus not having it.  In 1900, if you kept a carriage, no one\nasked what year or brand it was.  If you had one, you were rich.\nAnd if you weren't rich, you took the omnibus or walked.  Now even\nthe poorest Americans drive cars, and it is only because we're so\nwell trained by advertising that we can even recognize the especially\nexpensive ones.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f14n\"><font color=\"#777777\">14</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The same pattern has played out in industry after industry.  If\nthere is enough demand for something, technology will make it cheap\nenough to sell in large volumes, and the mass-produced versions\nwill be, if not better, at least more convenient.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f15n\"><font color=\"#777777\">15</font></a>]</font>\nAnd there\nis nothing the rich like more than convenience.  The rich people I\nknow drive the same cars, wear the same clothes, have the same kind\nof furniture, and eat the same foods as my other friends.  Their\nhouses are in different neighborhoods, or if in the same neighborhood\nare different sizes, but within them life is similar.  The houses\nare made using the same construction techniques and contain much\nthe same objects.  It's inconvenient to do something expensive and\ncustom.<br/><br/>The rich spend their time more like everyone else too.  Bertie\nWooster seems long gone.  Now, most people who are rich enough not\nto work do anyway.  It's not just social pressure that makes them;\nidleness is lonely and demoralizing.<br/><br/>Nor do we have the social distinctions there were a hundred years\nago.   The novels and etiquette manuals of that period read now\nlike descriptions of some strange tribal society.  \"With respect\nto the continuance of friendships...\" hints <i>Mrs. Beeton's Book\nof Household Management</i> (1880), \"it may be found necessary, in\nsome cases, for a mistress to relinquish, on assuming the responsibility\nof a household, many of those commenced in the earlier part of her\nlife.\" A woman who married a rich man was expected to drop friends\nwho didn't.  You'd seem a barbarian if you behaved that way today.\nYou'd also have a very boring life.  People still tend to segregate\nthemselves somewhat, but much more on the basis of education than\nwealth.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f16n\"><font color=\"#777777\">16</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Materially and socially, technology seems to be decreasing the gap\nbetween the rich and the poor, not increasing it.  If Lenin walked\naround the offices of a company like Yahoo or Intel or Cisco, he'd\nthink communism had won.  Everyone would be wearing the same clothes,\nhave the same kind of office (or rather, cubicle) with the same\nfurnishings, and address one another by their first names instead\nof by honorifics.  Everything would seem exactly as he'd predicted,\nuntil he looked at their bank accounts.  Oops.<br/><br/>Is it a problem if technology increases that gap?  It doesn't seem\nto be so far.  As it increases the gap in income, it seems to\ndecrease most other gaps.<br/><br/><b>Alternative to an Axiom</b><br/><br/>One often hears a policy criticized on the grounds that it would\nincrease the income gap between rich and poor.  As if it were an\naxiom that this would be bad.  It might be true that increased\nvariation in income would be bad, but I don't see how we can say\nit's <i>axiomatic.</i><br/><br/>Indeed, it may even be false, in industrial democracies.  In a\nsociety of serfs and warlords, certainly, variation in income is a\nsign of an underlying problem.  But serfdom is not the only cause\nof variation in income.  A 747 pilot doesn't make 40 times as much\nas a checkout clerk because he is a warlord who somehow holds her\nin thrall.  His skills are simply much more valuable.<br/><br/>I'd like to propose an alternative idea: that in a modern society,\nincreasing variation in income is a sign of health.  Technology\nseems to increase the variation in productivity at faster than\nlinear rates.  If we don't see corresponding variation in income,\nthere are three possible explanations: (a) that technical innovation\nhas stopped, (b) that the people who would create the most wealth\naren't doing it, or (c) that they aren't getting paid for it.<br/><br/>I think we can safely say that (a) and (b) would be bad.  If you\ndisagree, try living for a year using only the resources available\nto the average Frankish nobleman in 800, and report back to us.\n(I'll be generous and not send you back to the stone age.)<br/><br/>The only option, if you're going to have an increasingly prosperous\nsociety without increasing variation in income, seems to be (c),\nthat people will create a lot of wealth without being paid for it.\nThat Jobs and Wozniak, for example, will cheerfully work 20-hour\ndays to produce the Apple computer for a society that allows them,\nafter taxes, to keep just enough of their income to match what they\nwould have made working 9 to 5 at a big company.<br/><br/>Will people create wealth if they can't get paid for it?  Only if\nit's fun.  People will write operating systems for free.  But they\nwon't install them, or take support calls, or train customers to\nuse them.  And at least 90% of the work that even the highest tech\ncompanies do is of this second, unedifying kind.<br/><br/>All the unfun kinds of wealth creation slow dramatically in a society\nthat confiscates private fortunes.  We can confirm this empirically.\nSuppose you hear a strange noise that you think may be due to a\nnearby fan.  You turn the fan off, and the noise stops.  You turn\nthe fan back on, and the noise starts again.  Off, quiet.  On,\nnoise.  In the absence of other information, it would seem the noise\nis caused by the fan.<br/><br/>At various times and places in history, whether you could accumulate\na fortune by creating wealth has been turned on and off.  Northern\nItaly in 800, off (warlords would steal it).  Northern Italy in\n1100, on.  Central France in 1100, off (still feudal).  England in\n1800, on.  England in 1974, off (98% tax on investment income).\nUnited States in 1974, on.  We've even had a twin study: West\nGermany, on;  East Germany, off.  In every case, the creation of\nwealth seems to appear and disappear like the noise of a fan as you\nswitch on and off the prospect of keeping it.<br/><br/>There is some momentum involved.  It probably takes at least a\ngeneration to turn people into East Germans (luckily for England).\nBut if it were merely a fan we were studying, without all the extra\nbaggage that comes from the controversial topic of wealth, no one\nwould have any doubt that the fan was causing the noise.<br/><br/>If you suppress variations in income, whether by stealing private\nfortunes, as feudal rulers used to do, or by taxing them away, as\nsome modern governments have done, the result always seems to be\nthe same.    Society as a whole ends up poorer.<br/><br/>If I had a choice of living in a society where I was materially\nmuch better off than I am now, but was among the poorest, or in one\nwhere I was the richest, but much worse off than I am now, I'd take\nthe first option.  If I had children, it would arguably be immoral\nnot to.  It's absolute poverty you want to avoid, not relative\npoverty.  If, as the evidence so far implies, you have to have one\nor the other in your society, take relative poverty.<br/><br/>You need rich people in your society not so much because in spending\ntheir money they create jobs, but because of what they have to do\nto <i>get</i> rich.  I'm not talking about the trickle-down effect\nhere.  I'm not saying that if you let Henry Ford get rich, he'll\nhire you as a waiter at his next party.  I'm saying that he'll make\nyou a tractor to replace your horse.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nPart of the reason this subject is so contentious is that some\nof those most vocal on the subject of wealth—university\nstudents, heirs, professors, politicians, and journalists—have\nthe least experience creating it.  (This phenomenon will be familiar\nto anyone who has overheard conversations about sports in a bar.)<br/><br/>Students are mostly still on the parental dole, and have not stopped\nto think about where that money comes from.  Heirs will be on the\nparental dole for life.  Professors and politicians live within\nsocialist eddies of the economy, at one remove from the creation\nof wealth, and are paid a flat rate regardless of how hard they\nwork.  And journalists as part of their professional code segregate\nthemselves from the revenue-collecting half of the businesses they\nwork for (the ad sales department).  Many of these people never\ncome face to face with the fact that the money they receive represents\nwealth—wealth that, except in the case of journalists, someone\nelse created earlier.  They live in a world in which income <i>is</i>\ndoled out by a central authority according to some abstract notion\nof fairness (or randomly, in the case of heirs), rather than given\nby other people in return for something they wanted, so it may seem\nto them unfair that things don't work the same in the rest of the\neconomy.<br/><br/>(Some professors do create a great deal of wealth for\nsociety.  But the money they're paid isn't a <i>quid pro quo</i>.\nIt's more in the nature of an investment.)<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nWhen one reads about the origins of the Fabian Society, it\nsounds like something cooked up by the high-minded Edwardian\nchild-heroes of Edith Nesbit's <i>The Wouldbegoods</i>.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nAccording to a study by the Corporate Library, the median total\ncompensation, including salary, bonus, stock grants, and the exercise\nof stock options, of S&amp;P 500 CEOs in 2002 was $3.65 million.\nAccording to <i>Sports Illustrated</i>, the average NBA player's\nsalary during the 2002-03 season was $4.54 million, and the average\nmajor league baseball player's salary at the start of the 2003\nseason was $2.56 million.  According to the Bureau of Labor\nStatistics, the mean annual wage in the US in 2002 was $35,560.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f4n\"><font color=\"#000000\">4</font></a>]\nIn the early empire the price of an ordinary adult slave seems\nto have been about 2,000 sestertii (e.g. Horace, <i>Sat.</i> ii.7.43).\nA servant girl cost 600 (Martial vi.66), while Columella (iii.3.8)\nsays that a skilled vine-dresser was worth 8,000.  A doctor, P.\nDecimus Eros Merula, paid 50,000 sestertii for his freedom (Dessau,\n<i>Inscriptiones</i> 7812).  Seneca (<i>Ep.</i> xxvii.7) reports\nthat one Calvisius Sabinus paid 100,000 sestertii apiece for slaves\nlearned in the Greek classics.  Pliny (<i>Hist. Nat.</i> vii.39)\nsays that the highest price paid for a slave up to his time was\n700,000 sestertii, for the linguist (and presumably teacher) Daphnis,\nbut that this had since been exceeded by actors buying their own\nfreedom.<br/><br/>Classical Athens saw a similar variation in prices.  An ordinary\nlaborer was worth about 125 to 150 drachmae.  Xenophon (<i>Mem.</i>\nii.5) mentions prices ranging from 50 to 6,000 drachmae (for the\nmanager of a silver mine).<br/><br/>For more on the economics of ancient slavery see:<br/><br/>Jones, A. H.

In the Daddy Model, hard\nwork is in itself deserving.  In reality, wealth is measured by\nwhat one delivers, not how much effort it costs.  If I paint someone's\nhouse, the owner shouldn't pay me extra for doing it with a toothbrush.<br/><br/>It will seem to someone still implicitly operating on the Daddy\nModel that it is unfair when someone works hard and doesn't get\npaid much.  To help clarify the matter, get rid of everyone else\nand put our worker on a desert island, hunting and gathering fruit.\nIf he's bad at it he'll work very hard and not end up with much\nfood.  Is this unfair?  Who is being unfair to him?<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f8n\"><font color=\"#000000\">8</font></a>]\nPart of the reason for the tenacity of the Daddy Model may be\nthe dual meaning of \"distribution.\" When economists talk about\n\"distribution of income,\" they mean statistical distribution.  But\nwhen you use the phrase frequently, you can't help associating it\nwith the other sense of the word (as in e.g. \"distribution of alms\"),\nand thereby subconsciously seeing wealth as something that flows\nfrom some central tap.  The word \"regressive\" as applied to tax\nrates has a similar effect, at least on me; how can anything\n<i>regressive</i> be good?<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f9n\"><font color=\"#000000\">9</font></a>]\n\"From the beginning of the reign Thomas Lord Roos was an assiduous\ncourtier of the young Henry VIII and was soon to reap the rewards.\nIn 1525 he was made a Knight of the Garter and given the Earldom\nof Rutland.

Robert in particular\ntook bribery to the point of treason.  \"As Secretary of State and\nthe leading advisor to King James on foreign policy, [he] was a\nspecial recipient of favour, being offered large bribes by the Dutch\nnot to make peace with Spain, and large bribes by Spain to make\npeace.\" (Stone, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 17.)<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f12n\"><font color=\"#000000\">12</font></a>]\nThough Balzac made a lot of money from writing, he was notoriously\nimprovident and was troubled by debts all his life.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f13n\"><font color=\"#000000\">13</font></a>]\nA Timex will gain or lose about .5 seconds per day.

For example, if you were going back\nto 1970 it would certainly be less than $500, because the processing\npower you can get for $500 today would have been worth at least\n$150 million in 1970.  The function goes asymptotic fairly quickly,\nbecause for times over a hundred years or so you could get all you\nneeded in present-day trash.  In 1800 an empty plastic drink bottle\nwith a screw top would have seemed a miracle of workmanship.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f16n\"><font color=\"#000000\">16</font></a>]\nSome will say this amounts to the same thing, because the rich\nhave better opportunities for education.  That's a valid point.  It\nis still possible, to a degree, to buy your kids' way into top\ncolleges by sending them to private schools that in effect hack the\ncollege admissions process.<br/><br/>According to a 2002 report by the National Center for Education\nStatistics, about 1.7% of American kids attend private, non-sectarian\nschools.  At Princeton, 36% of the class of 2007 came from such\nschools.  (Interestingly, the number at Harvard is significantly\nlower, about 28%.)  Obviously this is a huge loophole.  It does at\nleast seem to be closing, not widening.<br/><br/>Perhaps the designers of admissions processes should take a lesson\nfrom the example of computer security, and instead of just assuming\nthat their system can't be hacked, measure the degree to which it\nis.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2004-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
