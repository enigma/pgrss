{"href":"divergence.html","title":"Could VC be a Casualty of the Recession?","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">December 2008<br/><br/><i>(I originally wrote this at the request of a company producing\na report about entrepreneurship.  Unfortunately after reading it\nthey decided  it was too controversial to include.)</i><br/><br/>\nVC funding will probably dry up somewhat during the present recession,\nlike it usually does in bad times.  But this time the result may\nbe different.  This time the number of new startups may not decrease.\nAnd that could be dangerous for VCs.<br/><br/>When VC funding dried up after the Internet Bubble, startups dried\nup too.   There were not a lot of new startups being founded in\n2003.  But startups aren't tied to VC the way they were 10 years\nago.  It's now possible for VCs and startups to diverge.  And if\nthey do, they may not reconverge once the economy gets better.<br/><br/>The reason startups no longer depend so much on VCs is one that\neveryone in the startup business knows by now: it has gotten much\ncheaper to start a startup.  There are four main reasons: Moore's\nlaw has made hardware cheap; open source has made software free;\nthe web has made marketing and distribution free; and more powerful\nprogramming languages mean development teams can be smaller.  These\nchanges have pushed the cost of starting a startup down into the\nnoise.  In a lot of startups—probaby most startups funded by\nY Combinator—the biggest expense is simply the founders'\nliving expenses.  We've had startups that were profitable on revenues\nof $3000 a month.<br/><br/>$3000 is insignificant as revenues go.  Why should anyone care about\na startup making $3000 a month?  Because, although insignificant\nas <i>revenue</i>, this amount of money can change a startup's\n<i>funding</i> situation completely.<br/><br/>Someone running a startup is always calculating in the back of their\nmind how much \"runway\" they have—how long they have till the\nmoney in the bank runs out and they either have to be profitable,\nraise more money, or go out of business.  Once you cross the threshold\nof profitability, however low, your runway becomes infinite.  It's\na qualitative change, like the stars turning into lines and\ndisappearing when the Enterprise accelerates to warp speed.  Once\nyou're profitable you don't need investors' money.  And because\nInternet startups have become so cheap to run, the threshold of\nprofitability can be trivially low.  Which means many Internet\nstartups don't need VC-scale investments anymore.  For many startups,\nVC funding has, in the language of VCs, gone from a must-have to a\nnice-to-have.<br/><br/>This change happened while no one was looking, and its effects have\nbeen largely masked so far.  It was during the trough after the\nInternet Bubble that it became trivially cheap to start a startup,\nbut few realized it because startups were so out of fashion.   When\nstartups came back into fashion, around 2005, investors were starting\nto write checks again.  And while founders may not have needed VC\nmoney the way they used to, they were willing to take it if\noffered—partly because there was a tradition of startups\ntaking VC money, and partly because startups, like dogs, tend to\neat when given the opportunity.  As long as VCs were writing checks,\nfounders were never forced to explore the limits of how little they\nneeded them.  There were a few startups who hit these limits\naccidentally because of their unusual circumstances—most\nfamously 37signals, which hit the limit because they crossed into\nstartup land from the other direction: they started as a consulting\nfirm, so they had revenue before they had a product.<br/><br/>VCs and founders are like two components that used to be bolted\ntogether.  Around 2000 the bolt was removed.  Because the components\nhave so far been subjected to the same forces, they still seem to\nbe joined together, but really one is just resting on the other.\nA sharp impact would make them fly apart.  And the present recession\ncould be that impact.<br/><br/>Because of Y Combinator's position at the extreme end of the spectrum,\nwe'd be the first to see signs of a separation between founders and\ninvestors, and we are in fact seeing it.  For example, though the\nstock market crash does seem to have made investors more cautious,\nit doesn't seem to have had any effect on the number of people who\nwant to start startups.  We take applications for funding every 6\nmonths.  Applications for the current funding cycle closed on October\n17, well after the markets tanked, and even so we got a record\nnumber, up 40% from the same cycle a year before.<br/><br/>Maybe things will be different a year from now, if the economy\ncontinues to get worse, but so far there is zero slackening of\ninterest among potential founders.  That's different from the way\nthings felt in 2001.  Then there was a widespread feeling among\npotential founders that startups were over, and that one should\njust go to grad school.   That isn't happening this time, and part\nof the reason is that even in a bad economy it's not that hard to\nbuild something that makes $3000 a month.  If investors stop writing\nchecks, who cares?<br/><br/>We also see signs of a divergence between founders and investors\nin the attitudes of existing startups we've funded.  I was talking\nto one recently that had a round fall through at the last minute\nover the sort of trifle that breaks deals when investors feel they\nhave the upper hand—over an uncertainty about whether the\nfounders had correctly filed their 83(b) forms, if you can believe\nthat.  And yet this startup is obviously going to succeed: their\ntraffic and revenue graphs look like a jet taking off.  So I asked\nthem if they wanted me to introduce them to more investors.  To my\nsurprise, they said no—that they'd just spent four months\ndealing with investors, and they were actually a lot happier now\nthat they didn't have to.  There was a friend they wanted to hire\nwith the investor money, and now they'd have to postpone that.  But\notherwise they felt they had enough in the bank to make it to\nprofitability.  To make sure, they were moving to a cheaper apartment.\nAnd in this economy I bet they got a good deal on it.<br/><br/>I've detected this \"investors aren't worth the trouble\" vibe from\nseveral YC founders I've talked to recently.  At least one startup\nfrom the most recent (summer) cycle may not even raise angel money,\nlet alone VC.  <a href=\"http://ticketstumbler.com\">Ticketstumbler</a>\nmade it to profitability on Y Combinator's $15,000 investment and\nthey hope not to need more.  This surprised even us.  Although YC\nis based on the idea of it being cheap to start a startup, we never\nanticipated that founders would grow successful startups on nothing\nmore than YC funding.<br/><br/>If founders decide VCs aren't worth the trouble, that could be bad\nfor VCs.  When the economy bounces back in a few years and they're\nready to write checks again, they may find that founders have moved\non.<br/><br/>There is a founder community just as there's a VC community.  They\nall know one another, and techniques spread rapidly between them.\nIf one tries a new programming language or a new hosting provider\nand gets good results, 6 months later half of them are using it.\nAnd the same is true for funding.  The current generation of founders\nwant to raise money from VCs, and Sequoia specifically, because\nLarry and Sergey took money from VCs, and Sequoia specifically.\nImagine what it would do to the VC business if the next hot company\ndidn't take VC at all.<br/><br/>VCs think they're playing a zero sum game.  In fact, it's not even\nthat.  If you lose a deal to Benchmark, you lose that deal, but VC\nas an industry still wins.  If you lose a deal to None, all VCs\nlose.<br/><br/>This recession may be different from the one after the Internet\nBubble.  This time founders may keep starting startups.  And if\nthey do, VCs will have to keep writing checks, or they could become\nirrelevant.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, David Hornik, Jessica\nLivingston, Robert Morris, and Fred Wilson for reading drafts of\nthis.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2008-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
