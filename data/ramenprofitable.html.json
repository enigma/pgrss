This is a different form of profitability\nthan startups have traditionally aimed for.  Traditional profitability\nmeans a big bet is finally paying off, whereas the main importance\nof ramen profitability is that it buys you time.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f1n\"><font color=\"#999999\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>In the past, a startup would usually become profitable only\nafter raising and spending quite a lot of money.  A company making\ncomputer hardware might not become profitable for 5 years, during\nwhich they spent $50 million.  But when they did\nthey might have revenues of $50 million a year.   This kind of\nprofitability means the startup has succeeded.<br/><br/>Ramen profitability is the other extreme: a startup that becomes\nprofitable after 2 months, even though its revenues are only $3000\na month, because the only employees are a couple 25 year old founders\nwho can live on practically nothing.  Revenues of $3000 a month do\nnot mean the company has succeeded.\nBut it does share something with the one\nthat's profitable in the traditional way: they don't need to raise\nmoney to survive.<br/><br/>Ramen profitability is an unfamiliar idea to most people because\nit only recently became feasible.  It's still not feasible for a\nlot of startups; it would not be for most biotech startups, for\nexample; but it is for many software startups because they're now\nso cheap.  For many, the only real cost is the founders'\nliving expenses.<br/><br/>The main significance of this type of profitability is that you're\nno longer at the mercy of investors.  If you're still losing money,\nthen eventually you'll either have to raise more\nor shut down.  Once you're\nramen profitable this painful choice goes away.\nYou can still raise money, but you don't have to do it now.<br/><br/><center>* * *</center><br/><br/>The most obvious advantage of not needing money is that\nyou can get better terms.  If investors know you need money, they'll\nsometimes take advantage of you.  Some may even deliberately\nstall, because they know that as you run out of money you'll become\nincreasingly pliable.<br/><br/>But there are also three less obvious advantages of ramen profitability.\nOne is that it makes you more attractive to investors.  If you're\nalready profitable, on however small a scale, it shows that (a) you\ncan get at least someone to pay you, (b) you're serious about\nbuilding things people want, and (c) you're disciplined enough to\nkeep expenses low.<br/><br/>This is reassuring to investors, because you've addressed three of\ntheir biggest worries.  It's common for them to fund companies that\nhave smart founders and a big market, and yet still fail.  When\nthese companies fail, it's usually because (a) people wouldn't pay\nfor what they made, e.g. because it was too hard to sell to them,\nor the market wasn't ready yet, (b) the founders solved the wrong\nproblem, instead of paying attention to what users needed, or (c)\nthe company spent too much and burned through their funding before\nthey started to make money.  If you're ramen profitable, you're\nalready avoiding these mistakes.<br/><br/>Another advantage of ramen profitability is that it's good for\nmorale.  A company\ntends to feel rather theoretical when you first start it.  It's\nlegally a company, but you feel like you're lying when you call it\none.  When people start to pay you significant amounts, the company\nstarts to feel real.  And your own living expenses are the milestone\nyou feel most, because at that point the future flips state.  Now\nsurvival is the default, instead of dying.<br/><br/>A morale boost on that scale is very valuable in a startup, because\nthe moral weight of running a startup is what makes it hard.  Startups\nare still very rare.  Why don't more people do it?  The financial\nrisk?  Plenty of 25 year olds save nothing anyway.  The long hours?\nPlenty of people work just as long hours in regular jobs. What keeps\npeople from starting startups is the fear of having so much\nresponsibility.  And this is not an irrational fear: it really is\nhard to bear.  Anything that takes some of that weight off you will \ngreatly increase your chances of surviving.<br/><br/>A startup that reaches ramen profitability may be more likely\nto succeed than not.  Which is pretty exciting, considering the\nbimodal distribution of outcomes in startups: you either fail or\nmake a lot of money.<br/><br/>The fourth advantage of ramen profitability is the least obvious\nbut may be the most important.  If you don't need to raise money,\nyou don't have to interrupt working on the company to do it.<br/><br/><a href=\"fundraising.html\">Raising money</a> is terribly distracting.  \nYou're lucky if your\nproductivity is a third of what it was before.  And it can last for\nmonths.<br/><br/>I didn't understand (or rather, remember) precisely why raising\nmoney was so distracting till earlier this year.  I'd noticed that\nstartups we funded would usually grind to a halt when they switched\nto raising money, but I didn't remember exactly why till YC raised\nmoney itself.  We had a comparatively easy time of it; the first\npeople I asked said yes; but it took months to work out the\ndetails, and during that time I got hardly any real work done.  Why?\nBecause I thought about it all the time.<br/><br/>At any given time there tends to be one problem that's the most\nurgent for a startup.  This is what you think about as you fall\nasleep at night and when you take a shower in the morning.  And\nwhen you start raising money, that becomes the problem you think\nabout.  You only take one shower in the morning, and if you're\nthinking about investors during it, then you're not thinking about\nthe product.<br/><br/>Whereas if you can choose when you raise money, you can pick a time\nwhen you're not in the middle of something else, and you can probably\nalso insist that the round close fast.  You may even be able to\navoid having the round occupy your thoughts, if you don't care\nwhether it closes.<br/><br/><center>* * *</center><br/><br/>Ramen profitable means no more than the definition implies.  It\ndoes not, for example, imply that you're \"bootstrapping\" the\nstartupâ€”that you're never going to take money from investors.\nEmpirically that doesn't seem to work very well.  Few startups\nsucceed without taking investment.  Maybe as startups get cheaper\nit will become more common.  On the other hand, the money is there,\nwaiting to be invested.  If startups need it less, they'll be able\nto get it on better terms, which will make them more inclined to\ntake it.  That will tend to produce an equilibrium.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f2n\"><font color=\"#999999\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Another thing ramen profitability doesn't imply is Joe Kraus's idea\nthat you should put your \n<a href=\"http://www.brendonwilson.com/blog/2006/04/30/joe-kraus-confessions-of-a-startup-addict/\">business model</a> in beta when you put your\nproduct in beta.  He believes you should get\npeople to pay you from the beginning.  I think that's too constraining.\nFacebook didn't, and they've done better than most startups.  Making\nmoney right away was not only unnecessary for them, but probably\nwould have been harmful.  I do think Joe's rule could be useful for\nmany startups, though.  When founders seem unfocused, I sometimes\nsuggest they try to get customers to pay them for something, in the\nhope that this constraint will prod them into action.<br/><br/>The difference between Joe's idea and ramen profitability is that\na ramen profitable company doesn't have to be making money the way\nit ultimately will.  It just has to be making money.  The most\nfamous example is Google, which initially made money by licensing\nsearch to sites like Yahoo.<br/><br/>Is there a downside to ramen profitability?  Probably the biggest\ndanger is that it might turn you into a consulting firm.  Startups\nhave to be product companies, in the sense of making a single thing\nthat everyone uses.  The defining quality of startups is that they\ngrow fast, and consulting just can't scale the way a product can.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f3n\"><font color=\"#999999\">3</font></a>]</font>\nBut it's pretty easy to make $3000 a month consulting; in\nfact, that would be a low rate for contract programming.  So there\ncould be a temptation to slide into consulting, and telling\nyourselves you're a ramen profitable startup, when in fact\nyou're not a startup at all.<br/><br/>It's ok to do a little consulting-type work at first.  Startups\nusually have to do something weird at first.  But remember\nthat ramen profitability is not the destination.  A startup's\ndestination is to grow really big; ramen profitability is a trick\nfor <a href=\"die.html\">not dying</a> en route.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nThe \"ramen\" in \"ramen profitable\" refers to instant ramen,\nwhich is just about the cheapest food available.<br/><br/>Please do not take the term literally.  Living on instant ramen\nwould be very unhealthy.  Rice and beans are a better source of\nfood.  Start by investing in a rice cooker, if you don't have one.<br/><br/>Rice and Beans for 2n\n<pre>\n  olive oil or butter\n  n yellow onions\n  other fresh vegetables; experiment\n  3n cloves garlic\n  n 12-oz cans white, kidney, or black beans\n  n cubes Knorr beef or vegetable bouillon\n  n teaspoons freshly ground black pepper\n  3n teaspoons ground cumin\n  n cups dry rice, preferably brown\n</pre>\nPut rice in rice cooker. Add water as specified on rice package.\n(Default: 2 cups water per cup of rice.) Turn on rice cooker and\nforget about it.<br/><br/>Chop onions and other vegetables and fry in oil, over fairly low\nheat, till onions are glassy. Put in chopped garlic, pepper, cumin,\nand a little more fat, and stir.  Keep heat low. Cook another 2 or\n3 minutes, then add beans (don't drain the beans), and stir. Throw\nin the bouillon cube(s), cover, and cook on lowish heat for at least\n10 minutes more. Stir vigilantly to avoid sticking.<br/><br/>If you want to save money, buy beans in giant cans from discount\nstores.  Spices are also much cheaper when bought in bulk.\nIf there's an Indian grocery store near you, they'll have big \nbags of cumin for the same price as the little jars in supermarkets.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nThere's a good chance that a shift in power from investors\nto founders would actually increase the size of the venture business.\nI think investors currently err too far on the side of being harsh\nto founders.  If they were forced to stop, the whole venture business\nwould work better, and you might see something like the increase\nin trade you always see when restrictive laws are removed.<br/><br/>Investors\nare one of the biggest sources of pain for founders; if they stopped\ncausing so much pain, it would be better to be a founder; and if\nit were better to be a founder, more people would do it.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nIt's conceivable that a startup could grow big by transforming\nconsulting into a form that would scale.  But if they did that\nthey'd really be a product company.<br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Jessica Livingston for reading drafts of this.<br/><br/></br></p></font>","date":"2009-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
