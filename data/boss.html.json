June 2008<br><br/>Technology tends to separate normal from natural.  Our bodies\nweren't designed to eat the foods that people in rich countries eat, or\nto get so little exercise.  \nThere may be a similar problem with the way we work: \na normal job may be as bad for us intellectually as white flour\nor sugar is for us physically.<br/><br/>I began to suspect this after spending several years working \nwith startup founders.  I've now worked with over 200 of them, and I've\nnoticed a definite difference between programmers working on their\nown startups and those working for large organizations.\nI wouldn't say founders seem happier, necessarily;\nstarting a startup can be very stressful. Maybe the best way to put\nit is to say that they're happier in the sense that your body is\nhappier during a long run than sitting on a sofa eating\ndoughnuts.<br/><br/>Though they're statistically abnormal, startup founders seem to be\nworking in a way that's more natural for humans.<br/><br/>I was in Africa last year and saw a lot of animals in the wild that\nI'd only seen in zoos before. It was remarkable how different they\nseemed. Particularly lions. Lions in the wild seem about ten times\nmore alive. They're like different animals. I suspect that working\nfor oneself feels better to humans in much the same way that living\nin the wild must feel better to a wide-ranging predator like a lion.\nLife in a zoo is easier, but it isn't the life they were designed\nfor.<br/><br/>\n<b>Trees</b><br/><br/>What's so unnatural about working for a big company?  The root of\nthe problem is that humans weren't meant to work in such large\ngroups.<br/><br/>Another thing you notice when you see animals in the wild is that\neach species thrives in groups of a certain size.  A herd of impalas\nmight have 100 adults; baboons maybe 20; lions rarely 10.  Humans\nalso seem designed to work in groups, and what I've read about\nhunter-gatherers accords with research on organizations and my own\nexperience to suggest roughly what the ideal size is: groups of 8\nwork well; by 20 they're getting hard to manage; and a group of 50\nis really unwieldy.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f1n\"><font color=\"#999999\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>\nWhatever the upper limit is, we are clearly not meant to work in\ngroups of several hundred.  And yet—for reasons having more\nto do with technology than human nature—a great many people\nwork for companies with hundreds or thousands of employees.<br/><br/>Companies know groups that large wouldn't work, so they divide\nthemselves into units small enough to work together.  But to\ncoordinate these they have to introduce something new: bosses.<br/><br/>These smaller groups are always arranged in a tree structure.  Your\nboss is the point where your group attaches to the tree.  But when\nyou use this trick for dividing a large group into smaller ones,\nsomething strange happens that I've never heard anyone mention\nexplicitly.  In the group one level up from yours, your boss\nrepresents your entire group.  A group of 10 managers is not merely\na group of 10 people working together in the usual way.  It's really\na group of groups.  Which means for a group of 10 managers to work\ntogether as if they were simply a group of 10 individuals, the group\nworking for each manager would have to work as if they were a single\nperson—the workers and manager would each share only one\nperson's worth of freedom between them.<br/><br/>In practice a group of people are never able to act as if they were\none person.  But in a large organization divided into groups in\nthis way, the pressure is always in that direction.  Each group\ntries its best to work as if it were the small group of individuals\nthat humans were designed to work in.  That was the point of creating\nit.  And when you propagate that constraint, the result is that\neach person gets freedom of action in inverse proportion to the\nsize of the entire tree.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f2n\"><font color=\"#999999\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Anyone who's worked for a large organization has felt this.  You\ncan feel the difference between working for a company with 100\nemployees and one with 10,000, even if your group has only 10 people.<br/><br/>\n<b>Corn Syrup</b><br/><br/>A group of 10 people within a large organization is a kind of fake\ntribe.  The number of people you interact with is about right.  But\nsomething is missing: individual initiative.  Tribes of hunter-gatherers\nhave much more freedom.  The leaders have a little more power than other\nmembers of the tribe, but they don't generally tell them what to\ndo and when the way a boss can.<br/><br/>It's not your boss's fault.  The real problem is that in the group\nabove you in the hierarchy, your entire group is one virtual person.\nYour boss is just the way that constraint is imparted to you.<br/><br/>So working in a group of 10 people within a large organization feels\nboth right and wrong at the same time.   On the surface it feels\nlike the kind of group you're meant to work in, but something major\nis missing.  A job at a big company is like high fructose corn\nsyrup: it has some of the qualities of things you're meant to like,\nbut is disastrously lacking in others.<br/><br/>Indeed, food is an excellent metaphor to explain what's wrong with\nthe usual sort of job.<br/><br/>For example, working for a big company is the default thing to do,\nat least for programmers.  How bad could it be?  Well, food shows\nthat pretty clearly.  If you were dropped at a random point in\nAmerica today, nearly all the food around you would be bad for you.\nHumans were not designed to eat white flour, refined sugar, high\nfructose corn syrup, and hydrogenated vegetable oil.  And yet if\nyou analyzed the contents of the average grocery store you'd probably\nfind these four ingredients accounted for most of the calories.\n\"Normal\" food is terribly bad for you.  The only people who eat\nwhat humans were actually designed to eat are a few Birkenstock-wearing\nweirdos in Berkeley.<br/><br/>If \"normal\" food is so bad for us, why is it so common?  There are\ntwo main reasons. One is that it has more immediate appeal.  You\nmay feel lousy an hour after eating that pizza, but eating the first\ncouple bites feels great.  The other is economies of scale.\nProducing junk food scales; producing fresh vegetables doesn't.\nWhich means (a) junk food can be very cheap, and (b) it's worth\nspending a lot to market it.<br/><br/>If people have to choose between something that's cheap, heavily\nmarketed, and appealing in the short term, and something that's\nexpensive, obscure, and appealing in the long term, which do you\nthink most will choose?<br/><br/>It's the same with work.  The average MIT graduate wants to work\nat Google or Microsoft, because it's a recognized brand, it's safe,\nand they'll get paid a good salary right away.  It's the job\nequivalent of the pizza they had for lunch.  The drawbacks will\nonly become apparent later, and then only in a vague sense of\nmalaise.<br/><br/>And founders and early employees of startups, meanwhile, are like\nthe Birkenstock-wearing weirdos of Berkeley:  though a tiny minority\nof the population, they're the ones living as humans are meant to.\nIn an artificial world, only extremists live naturally.<br/><br/>\n<b>Programmers</b><br/><br/>The restrictiveness of big company jobs is particularly hard on\nprogrammers, because the essence of programming is to build new\nthings.  Sales people make much the same pitches every day; support\npeople answer much the same questions; but once you've written a\npiece of code you don't need to write it again.  So a programmer\nworking as programmers are meant to is always making new things.\nAnd when you're part of an organization whose structure gives each\nperson freedom in inverse proportion to the size of the tree, you're\ngoing to face resistance when you do something new.<br/><br/>This seems an inevitable consequence of bigness.  It's true even\nin the smartest companies.  I was talking recently to a founder who\nconsidered starting a startup right out of college, but went to\nwork for Google instead because he thought he'd learn more there.\nHe didn't learn as much as he expected.  Programmers learn by doing,\nand most of the things he wanted to do, he couldn't—sometimes\nbecause the company wouldn't let him, but often because the company's\ncode wouldn't let him.  Between the drag of legacy code, the overhead\nof doing development in such a large organization, and the restrictions\nimposed by interfaces owned by other groups, he could only try a\nfraction of the things he would have liked to.  He said he has\nlearned much more in his own startup, despite the fact that he has\nto do all the company's errands as well as programming, because at\nleast when he's programming he can do whatever he wants.<br/><br/>An obstacle downstream propagates upstream.  If you're not allowed\nto implement new ideas, you stop having them.  And vice versa: when\nyou can do whatever you want, you have more ideas about what to do.\nSo working for yourself makes your brain more powerful in the same\nway a low-restriction exhaust system makes an engine more powerful.<br/><br/>Working for yourself doesn't have to mean starting a startup, of\ncourse.  But a programmer deciding between a regular job at a big\ncompany and their own startup is probably going to learn more doing\nthe startup.<br/><br/>You can adjust the amount of freedom you get by scaling the size\nof company you work for.  If you start the company, you'll have the\nmost freedom.  If you become one of the first 10 employees you'll\nhave almost as much freedom as the founders.  Even a company with\n100 people will feel different from one with 1000.<br/><br/>Working for a small company doesn't ensure freedom.  The tree\nstructure of large organizations sets an upper bound on freedom,\nnot a lower bound.  The head of a small company may still choose\nto be a tyrant.  The point is that a large organization is compelled\nby its structure to be one.<br/><br/>\n<b>Consequences</b><br/><br/>That has real consequences for both organizations and individuals.\nOne is that companies will inevitably slow down as they grow larger,\nno matter how hard they try to keep their startup mojo.  It's a\nconsequence of the tree structure that every large organization is\nforced to adopt.<br/><br/>Or rather, a large organization could only avoid slowing down if\nthey avoided tree structure.  And since human nature limits the\nsize of group that can work together, the only way I can imagine\nfor larger groups to avoid tree structure would be to have no\nstructure: to have each group actually be independent, and to work\ntogether the way components of a market economy do.<br/><br/>That might be worth exploring.  I suspect there are already some\nhighly partitionable businesses that lean this way.  But I don't\nknow any technology companies that have done it.<br/><br/>There is one thing companies can do short of structuring themselves\nas sponges:  they can stay small.  If I'm right, then it really\npays to keep a company as small as it can be at every stage.\nParticularly a technology company.  Which means it's doubly important\nto hire the best people.  Mediocre hires hurt you twice: they get\nless done, but they also make you big, because you need more of\nthem to solve a given problem.<br/><br/>For individuals the upshot is the same: aim small.  It will always\nsuck to work for large organizations, and the larger the organization,\nthe more it will suck.<br/><br/>In an <a href=\"start.html\">essay</a> I wrote a couple years ago \nI advised graduating seniors\nto work for a couple years for another company before starting their\nown.  I'd modify that now.  Work for another company if you want\nto, but only for a small one, and if you want to start your own\nstartup, go ahead.<br/><br/>The reason I suggested college graduates not start startups immediately\nwas that I felt most would fail.  And they will.  But ambitious\nprogrammers are better off doing their own thing and failing than\ngoing to work at a big company.  Certainly they'll learn more.  They\nmight even be better off financially.  A lot of people in their\nearly twenties get into debt, because their expenses grow even\nfaster than the salary that seemed so high when they left school.\nAt least if you start a startup and fail your net worth will be\nzero rather than negative.  \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f3n\"><font color=\"#999999\">3</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>We've now funded so many different types of founders that we have\nenough data to see patterns, and there seems to be no benefit from\nworking for a big company.  The people who've worked for a few years\ndo seem better than the ones straight out of college, but only\nbecause they're that much older.<br/><br/>The people who come to us from big companies often seem kind of\nconservative.  It's hard to say how much is because big companies\nmade them that way, and how much is the natural conservatism that\nmade them work for the big companies in the first place.  But\ncertainly a large part of it is learned.  I know because I've seen\nit burn off.<br/><br/>Having seen that happen so many times is one of the things that\nconvinces me that working for oneself, or at least for a small\ngroup, is the natural way for programmers to live.  Founders arriving\nat Y Combinator often have the downtrodden air of refugees.  Three\nmonths later they're transformed: they have so much more \n<a href=\"http://paulmckellar.com/photos/03l\">confidence</a>\nthat they seem as if they've grown several inches taller. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f4n\"><font color=\"#999999\">4</font></a>]</font>\nStrange as this sounds, they seem both more worried and happier at the same\ntime.  Which is exactly how I'd describe the way lions seem in the\nwild.<br/><br/>Watching employees get transformed into founders makes it clear\nthat the difference between the two is due mostly to environment—and\nin particular that the environment in big companies is toxic to\nprogrammers.   In the first couple weeks of working on their own\nstartup they seem to come to life, because finally they're working\nthe way people are meant to.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nWhen I talk about humans being meant or designed to live a\ncertain way, I mean by evolution.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nIt's not only the leaves who suffer.
