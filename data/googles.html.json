Google might simply have been nothing but Yahoo's or\n  MSN's search box.<br/><br/>Why isn't it? Because Google had a deeply felt sense of purpose:\n  a conviction to change the world for the better.\n</blockquote>\nThis has a nice sound to it, but it isn't true. \nGoogle's founders were willing to sell early on.\nThey just wanted more than acquirers were willing to pay.<br/><br/>It was the same with Facebook.  They would have sold, but Yahoo blew it \nby offering too little.<br/><br/>Tip for acquirers: when a startup turns you down, consider raising\nyour offer, because there's a good chance the outrageous price they \nwant will later seem a bargain. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/googles.html#f1n\"><font color=\"#999999\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>From the evidence I've seen so far,\nstartups that turn down acquisition offers usually end up doing better.  \nNot always, but usually there's a bigger offer coming, or\nperhaps even an IPO.<br/><br/>Of course, the reason startups do better when they turn down\nacquisition offers is not necessarily that all such offers undervalue\nstartups.  More likely the reason is that the kind of founders who\nhave the balls to turn down a big offer also tend to be very\nsuccessful.  That spirit is exactly what you want in a startup.<br/><br/>While I'm sure Larry and Sergey do want to change the world, at\nleast now, the reason Google survived to become a big, independent\ncompany is the same reason Facebook has so far remained independent:\nacquirers underestimated them.<br/><br/>Corporate M&amp;A is a strange business in that respect.  They consistently\nlose the best deals, because turning down reasonable offers is the\nmost reliable test you could invent for whether a startup will make\nit big.<br/><br/><b>VCs</b><br/><br/>So what's the real reason there aren't more Googles?  Curiously\nenough, it's the same reason Google and Facebook have remained\nindependent: money guys undervalue the most innovative startups.<br/><br/>The reason there aren't more Googles is not that investors encourage\ninnovative startups to sell out, but that they won't even fund them.\nI've learned a lot about VCs during the 3 years we've been doing Y\nCombinator, because we often have to work quite closely with them.\nThe most surprising thing I've learned is how conservative they\nare.  VC firms present an image of boldly encouraging innovation.\nOnly a handful actually do, and even they are more conservative in\nreality than you'd guess from reading their sites.<br/><br/>I used to think of VCs as piratical: bold but unscrupulous.  On\ncloser acquaintance they turn out to be more like bureaucrats.\nThey're more upstanding than I used to think (the good ones, at\nleast), but less bold.  Maybe the VC industry has changed.  Maybe\nthey used to be bolder.  \nBut I suspect it's the startup world that has\nchanged, not them.  The low cost of starting a startup means the\naverage good bet is a riskier one, but most existing VC firms still\noperate as if they were investing in hardware startups in 1985.<br/><br/>Howard Aiken said \"Don't worry about people stealing your ideas.\nIf your ideas are any good, you'll have to ram them down people's\nthroats.\" I have a similar feeling when I'm trying to convince VCs\nto invest in startups Y Combinator has funded.  They're terrified\nof really novel ideas, unless the founders are good enough salesmen\nto compensate.<br/><br/>But it's the bold ideas that generate the biggest returns.  Any\nreally good new idea will seem bad to most people; otherwise someone\nwould already be doing it.  And\nyet most VCs are driven by consensus, not just within their firms,\nbut within the VC community.  The biggest factor determining how a\nVC will feel about your startup is how other VCs feel about it.  I\ndoubt they realize it, but this algorithm guarantees they'll miss\nall the very best ideas.  The more people who have to like a new\nidea, the more outliers you lose.<br/><br/>Whoever the next Google is, they're probably being told right now\nby VCs to come back when they have more \"traction.\"<br/><br/>Why are VCs so conservative?  It's probably a combination of factors.\nThe large size of their investments makes them conservative.\nPlus they're investing other people's money, which makes\nthem worry they'll get in trouble if they do something risky and\nit fails.  Plus most of them are money guys rather than technical\nguys, so they don't understand what the startups they're investing\nin do.<br/><br/><a name=\"next\"><b>What's Next</b></a><br/><br/>The exciting thing about market economies is that stupidity equals\nopportunity.  And so it is in this case.  There is a huge, unexploited\nopportunity in startup investing.  Y Combinator funds startups at\nthe very beginning.  VCs will fund them once they're already starting\nto succeed.  But between the two there is a substantial gap.<br/><br/>There are companies that will give $20k to a startup that has nothing\nmore than the founders, and there are companies that will give $2\nmillion to a startup that's already taking off,\nbut there aren't enough investors who will give $200k to a startup\nthat seems very promising but still has some things to figure out.\nThis territory is occupied mostly by\nindividual angel investors—people like Andy Bechtolsheim, who\ngave Google $100k when they seemed promising but still had some\nthings to figure out. I like angels, but there just aren't enough\nof them, and investing is for most of them a part time job.<br/><br/>And yet as it gets cheaper to start startups, this sparsely occupied\nterritory is becoming more and more valuable.   Nowadays a lot of\nstartups don't want to raise multi-million dollar series A rounds.\nThey don't need that much money, and they don't want the hassles\nthat come with it.  The median startup coming out of Y Combinator\nwants to raise $250-500k.  When they go to VC firms they have to\nask for more because they know VCs aren't interested in such small\ndeals.<br/><br/>VCs are money managers.  They're looking for ways to put large sums\nto work.  But the startup world is evolving away from their current\nmodel.<br/><br/>Startups have gotten cheaper.  That means they want less money, but\nalso that there are more of them.  So you can still get large returns\non large amounts of money; you just have to spread it more broadly.<br/><br/>I've tried to explain this to VC firms.  Instead of making one $2\nmillion investment, make five $400k investments.  Would that mean\nsitting on too many boards?  Don't sit on their boards.  Would that\nmean too much due diligence?  Do less.  If you're investing at a\ntenth the valuation, you only have to be a tenth as sure.<br/><br/>It seems obvious.  But I've proposed to several VC firms that they\nset aside some money and designate one partner to make more, smaller\nbets, and they react as if I'd proposed the partners all get nose\nrings.  It's remarkable how wedded they are to their standard m.o.<br/><br/>But there is a big opportunity here, and one way or the other it's\ngoing to get filled.  Either VCs will evolve down into this gap or,\nmore likely, new investors will appear to fill it.  That will be a\ngood thing when it happens, because these new investors will be\ncompelled by the structure of the investments they make to be ten\ntimes bolder than present day VCs.  And that will get us a lot more\nGoogles.  At least, as long as acquirers remain stupid.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nAnother tip: If you want to get all that value, don't destroy the\nstartup after you buy it.  Give the founders enough autonomy that\nthey can grow the acquisition into what it would have become.<br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, David Hornik, Jessica \nLivingston, Robert Morris, and Fred Wilson for reading drafts of this.<br/><br/></br></p></font>","date":"2008-04-01T00:00:00Z"}
