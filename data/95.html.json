{"href":"95.html","title":"Let the Other 95% of Great Programmers In","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">December 2014<br/><br/>American technology companies want the government to make immigration\neasier because they say they can't find enough programmers in the\nUS.  Anti-immigration people say that instead of letting foreigners\ntake these jobs, we should train more Americans to be programmers.\nWho's right?<br/><br/>The technology companies are right. What the anti-immigration people\ndon't understand is that there is a huge variation in ability between\ncompetent programmers and exceptional ones, and while you can train\npeople to be competent, you can't train them to be exceptional.\nExceptional programmers have an aptitude for and \n<a href=\"genius.html\"><u>interest in</u></a>\nprogramming that is not merely the product of training.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f1n\"><font color=\"#999999\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The US has less than 5% of the world's population.  Which means if\nthe qualities that make someone a great programmer are evenly\ndistributed, 95% of great programmers are born outside the US.<br/><br/>The anti-immigration people have to invent some explanation to\naccount for all the effort technology companies have expended trying\nto make immigration easier.  So they claim it's because they want\nto drive down salaries.  But if you talk to startups, you find\npractically every one over a certain size has gone through legal\ncontortions to get programmers into the US, where they then\npaid them the same as they'd have paid an American.  Why would they\ngo to extra trouble to get programmers for the same price?  The\nonly explanation is that they're telling the truth: there are just\nnot enough great programmers to go around.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f2n\"><font color=\"#999999\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>I asked the CEO of a startup with about 70 programmers how many\nmore he'd hire if he could get all the great programmers he wanted.\nHe said \"We'd hire 30 tomorrow morning.\"  And this is one of the\nhot startups that always win recruiting battles. It's the same all\nover Silicon Valley.  Startups are that constrained for talent.<br/><br/>It would be great if more Americans were trained as programmers,\nbut no amount of training can flip a ratio as overwhelming as 95\nto 5. Especially since programmers are being trained in other\ncountries too.  Barring some cataclysm, it will always be true that\nmost great programmers are born outside the US.  It will always be\ntrue that most people who are great at anything are born outside\nthe US.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f3n\"><font color=\"#999999\">3</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Exceptional performance implies immigration.  A country with only\na few percent of the world's population will be exceptional in some\nfield only if there are a lot of immigrants working in it.<br/><br/>But this whole discussion has taken something for granted: that if\nwe let more great programmers into the US, they'll want to come.\nThat's true now, and we don't realize how lucky we are that it is.\nIf we want to keep this option open, the best way to do it is to\ntake advantage of it: the more of the world's great programmers are\nhere, the more the rest will want to come here.<br/><br/>And if we don't, the US could be seriously fucked. I realize that's\nstrong language, but the people dithering about this don't seem to\nrealize the power of the forces at work here.  Technology gives the\nbest programmers huge leverage.  The world market in programmers\nseems to be becoming dramatically more liquid.  And since good\npeople like good colleagues, that means the best programmers could\ncollect in just a few hubs.  Maybe mostly in one hub.<br/><br/>What if most of the great programmers collected in one hub, and it\nwasn't here?  That scenario may seem unlikely now, but it won't be\nif things change as much in the next 50 years as they did in the\nlast 50.<br/><br/>We have the potential to ensure that the US remains a technology\nsuperpower just by letting in a few thousand great programmers a\nyear.  What a colossal mistake it would be to let that opportunity\nslip.  It could easily be the defining mistake this generation of\nAmerican politicians later become famous for.  And unlike other\npotential mistakes on that scale, it costs nothing to fix.<br/><br/>So please, get on with it.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nHow much better is a great programmer than an ordinary one?\nSo much better that you can't even measure the difference directly.\nA great programmer doesn't merely do the same work faster.  A great\nprogrammer will invent things an ordinary programmer would never\neven think of.  This doesn't mean a great programmer is infinitely\nmore valuable, because any invention has a finite market value.\nBut it's easy to imagine cases where a great programmer might invent\nthings worth 100x or even 1000x an average programmer's salary.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nThere are a handful of consulting firms that rent out big\npools of foreign programmers they bring in on H1-B visas.  By all\nmeans crack down on these.  It should be easy to write legislation\nthat distinguishes them, because they are so different from technology\ncompanies.  But it is dishonest of the anti-immigration people to\nclaim that companies like Google and Facebook are driven by the\nsame motives.  An influx of inexpensive but mediocre programmers\nis the last thing they'd want; it would destroy them.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nThough this essay talks about programmers, the group of people\nwe need to import is broader, ranging from designers to programmers\nto electrical engineers.  The best one could do as a general term\nmight be \"digital talent.\" It seemed better to make the argument a\nlittle too narrow than to confuse everyone with a neologism.<br/><br/>\n<b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, John Collison, Patrick Collison, Jessica\nLivingston, Geoff Ralston, Fred Wilson, and Qasar Younis for reading\ndrafts of this.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2014-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
