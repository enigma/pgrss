One reason we don't see them is a phenomenon I call\n<i>schlep blindness</i>.  Schlep was originally a Yiddish word but has\npassed into general use in the US.  It means a tedious, unpleasant\ntask.<br/><br/>No one likes schleps, but hackers especially dislike them.  \nMost hackers who start startups wish they could do it by just writing\nsome clever software, putting it on a server somewhere, and watching\nthe money roll inâ€”without ever having to talk to users, or negotiate\nwith other companies, or deal with other people's broken code.\nMaybe that's possible, but I haven't seen it.<br/><br/>One of the many things we do at Y Combinator is teach hackers about\nthe inevitability of schleps.  No, you can't start a startup by\njust writing code.  I remember going through this realization myself.\nThere was a point in 1995 when I was still trying to convince myself\nI could start a company by just writing code.  But I soon learned\nfrom experience that schleps are not merely inevitable, but pretty\nmuch what business consists of.  A company is defined by the schleps\nit will undertake.  And schleps should be dealt with the same way\nyou'd deal with a cold swimming pool: just jump in.  Which is not\nto say you should seek out unpleasant work per se, but that you\nshould never shrink from it if it's on the path to something great.<br/><br/>The most dangerous thing about our dislike of schleps is that much\nof it is unconscious.  Your unconscious won't even let you see ideas\nthat involve painful schleps.  That's schlep blindness.<br/><br/>The phenomenon isn't limited to startups.  Most people don't\nconsciously decide not to be in as good physical shape as Olympic\nathletes, for example.  Their unconscious mind decides for them,\nshrinking from the work involved.<br/><br/>The most striking example I know of schlep blindness is \n<a href=\"http://stripe.com\">Stripe</a>, or\nrather Stripe's idea.  For over a decade, every hacker who'd ever\nhad to process payments online knew how painful the experience was.\nThousands of people must have known about this problem.  And yet\nwhen they started startups, they decided to build recipe sites, or\naggregators for local events.  Why?  Why work on problems few care\nmuch about and no one will pay for, when you could fix one of the\nmost important components of the world's infrastructure?  Because\nschlep blindness prevented people from even considering the idea\nof fixing payments.<br/><br/>Probably no one who applied to Y Combinator to work on a recipe\nsite began by asking \"should we fix payments, or build a recipe\nsite?\" and chose the recipe site.  Though the idea of fixing payments\nwas right there in plain sight, they never saw it, because their\nunconscious mind shrank from the complications involved.  You'd\nhave to make deals with banks.  How do you do that?  Plus you're\nmoving money, so you're going to have to deal with fraud, and people\ntrying to break into your servers.  Plus there are probably all\nsorts of regulations to comply with.  It's a lot more intimidating\nto start a startup like this than a recipe site.<br/><br/>That scariness makes ambitious ideas doubly valuable.  In addition\nto their intrinsic value, they're like undervalued stocks in the\nsense that there's less demand for them among founders.  If you\npick an ambitious idea, you'll have less competition, because\neveryone else will have been frightened off by the challenges\ninvolved.  (This is also true of starting a startup generally.)<br/><br/>How do you overcome schlep blindness?  Frankly, the most valuable\nantidote to schlep blindness is probably ignorance.  Most successful\nfounders would probably say that if they'd known when they were\nstarting their company about the obstacles they'd have to overcome,\nthey might never have started it.  Maybe that's one reason the most\nsuccessful startups of all so often have young founders.<br/><br/>In practice the founders grow with the problems.  But no one seems\nable to foresee that, not even older, more experienced founders.\nSo the reason younger founders have an advantage is that they make\ntwo mistakes that cancel each other out.  They don't know how much\nthey can grow, but they also don't know how much they'll need to.\nOlder founders only make the first mistake.<br/><br/>Ignorance can't solve everything though.  Some ideas so obviously\nentail alarming schleps that anyone can see them.  How do you see\nideas like that?  The trick I recommend is to take yourself out of\nthe picture.  Instead of asking \"what problem should I solve?\" ask\n\"what problem do I wish someone else would solve for me?\"  If someone\nwho had to process payments before Stripe had tried asking that,\nStripe would have been one of the first things they wished for.<br/><br/>It's too late now to be Stripe, but there's plenty still broken in\nthe world, if you know how to see it.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Patrick Collison,\nAaron Iba, Jessica Livingston, Emmett Shear, and Harj Taggar\nfor reading drafts of this.<br/><br/></br></p></font>","date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
