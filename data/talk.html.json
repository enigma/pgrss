They write\nin a different language than they'd use if they were talking to a\nfriend. The sentence structure and even the words are different.\nNo one uses \"pen\" as a verb in spoken English. You'd feel like an\nidiot using \"pen\" instead of \"write\" in a conversation with a friend.<br/><br/>The last straw for me was a sentence I read a couple days ago:\n<blockquote>\n  The mercurial Spaniard himself declared: \"After Altamira, all is\n  decadence.\"\n</blockquote>\nIt's from Neil Oliver's <i>A History of Ancient Britain</i>. I feel bad\nmaking an example of this book, because it's no worse than lots of\nothers.  But just imagine calling Picasso \"the mercurial Spaniard\" when\ntalking to a friend.  Even one\nsentence of this would raise eyebrows in conversation.  And yet\npeople write whole books of it.<br/><br/>Ok, so written and spoken language are different. Does that make\nwritten language worse?<br/><br/>If you want people to read and understand what you write, yes.\nWritten language is more complex, which makes it more work to read.\nIt's also more formal and distant, which gives the reader's attention\npermission to drift.  But perhaps worst of all, the complex sentences\nand fancy words give you, the writer, the false impression that\nyou're saying more than you actually are.<br/><br/>You don't need complex sentences to express complex ideas.  When\nspecialists in some abstruse topic talk to one another about ideas\nin their field, they don't use sentences any more complex than they\ndo when talking about what to have for lunch.  They use different\nwords, certainly.  But even those they use no more than necessary.\nAnd in my experience, the harder the subject, the more informally\nexperts speak. Partly, I think, because they have less to prove,\nand partly because the harder the ideas you're talking about, the\nless you can afford to let language get in the way.<br/><br/>Informal language is the athletic clothing of ideas.<br/><br/>I'm not saying spoken language always works best. Poetry is as much\nmusic as text, so you can say things you wouldn't say in conversation.\nAnd there are a handful of writers who can get away with using fancy\nlanguage in prose. And then of course there are cases where writers\ndon't want to make it easy to understand what they're sayingâ€”in\ncorporate announcements of bad news, for example, or at the more\n<a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=1,5&amp;q=transgression+narrative+postmodern+gender\"><u>bogus</u></a> end of the humanities.  But for nearly everyone else, spoken\nlanguage is better.<br/><br/>It seems to be hard for most people to write in spoken language.\nSo perhaps the best solution is to write your first draft the way\nyou usually would, then afterward look at each sentence and ask \"Is\nthis the way I'd say this if I were talking to a friend?\" If it\nisn't, imagine what you would say, and use that instead.  After a\nwhile this filter will start to operate as you write. When you write\nsomething you wouldn't say, you'll hear the clank as it hits the\npage.<br/><br/>Before I publish a new essay, I read it out loud and fix everything\nthat doesn't sound like conversation. I even fix bits that are\nphonetically awkward; I don't know if that's necessary, but it\ndoesn't cost much.<br/><br/>This trick may not always be enough.  I've seen writing so far\nremoved from spoken language that it couldn't be fixed sentence by\nsentence.  For cases like that there's a more drastic solution.\nAfter writing the first draft, try explaining to a friend what you\njust wrote. Then replace the draft with what you said to your friend.<br/><br/>People often tell me how much my essays sound like me talking.\nThe fact that this seems worthy of comment shows how rarely people\nmanage to write in spoken language.  Otherwise everyone's writing\nwould sound like them talking.<br/><br/>If you simply manage to write in spoken language, you'll be ahead\nof 95% of writers.  And it's so easy to do: just don't let a sentence\nthrough unless it's the way you'd say it to a friend.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Patrick Collison and Jessica Livingston for reading drafts of this.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2015-10-01T00:00:00Z"}
