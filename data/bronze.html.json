It's an experiment because\nwe're prepared to fund younger founders than most investors would.\nThat's why we're doing it during the summer—so even college\nstudents can participate.<br/><br/>We know from Google and Yahoo that grad students can start successful\nstartups.  And we know from experience that some undergrads are as\ncapable as most grad students.  The accepted age for startup founders\nhas been creeping downward. We're trying to find the lower bound.<br/><br/><!-- There have been cases, certainly, of startups founded by people\nstill in their teens.  But I suspect few of them were allowed\nby investors to be more than mascots.<br /><br />That's not how we plan to operate.  Having done it once, we have\nno desire to experience again the 24/7 timesuck of running even one\nstartup, let alone eight or ten.  We'll give these guys as much\nhelp as we can with their ideas, but it will be up to them to sink\nor swim.\n-->\nThe deadline has now passed, and we're sifting through 227 applications.\n<!--We've learned a few surprising things in the process.\nOne pleasant surprise is how few cranks we got.  We expected to\nattract flocks of them, but we've only had a handful.  We were\nsurprised, too, at how smart the applicants appear to be.  And how\nextraordinarily energetic.  But you know what the most surprising\nthing is?  How bad some of the smartest applicants' ideas are.-->\nWe expected to divide them into two categories, promising\nand unpromising.  But we soon saw we needed a third: promising\npeople with unpromising ideas.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/bronze.html#f1n\" name=\"f1\"><font color=\"#777777\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/><b>The Artix Phase</b><br/><br/>We should have expected this.  It's very common for a group of\nfounders to go through one lame idea before realizing that a startup\nhas to make something people will pay for.   In fact, we ourselves\ndid.<br/><br/>Viaweb wasn't the first startup Robert Morris and I started.  In\nJanuary 1995, we and a couple friends started a company called\nArtix.  The plan was to put art galleries on the Web.  In retrospect,\nI wonder how we could have wasted our time on anything so stupid.\nGalleries are not especially <a href=\"http://www.knoedlergallery.com/\">excited</a> about being on\nthe Web even now, ten years later.  They don't want to have their\nstock visible to any random visitor, like an antique store. \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/bronze.html#f2n\" name=\"f2\"><font color=\"#777777\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Besides which, art dealers are the most technophobic people on\nearth.  They didn't become art dealers after a difficult choice\nbetween that and a career in the hard sciences.  Most of them had\nnever seen the Web before we came to tell them why they should be\non it.  Some didn't even have computers.  It doesn't do justice to\nthe situation to describe it as a hard <i>sell</i>; we soon sank\nto building sites for free, and it was hard to convince galleries\neven to do that.<br/><br/>Gradually it dawned on us that \ninstead of trying to make Web sites for\npeople who didn't want them, we could make sites for\npeople who did.  In fact, software that would let people who wanted\nsites make their own.  So we ditched Artix and\nstarted a new company, Viaweb, to make software for building online stores.\nThat one succeeded.<br/><br/>We're in good company here.  Microsoft was not the first company\nPaul Allen and Bill Gates started either.  The first was called\nTraf-o-data.  <!-- I don't know exactly what happened to Traf-o-data,  \nbut i-->It does not seem to have done as well as Micro-soft.\n<!-- , as Microsoft was called then.--><br/><br/>In Robert's defense, he was skeptical about Artix.  I dragged him\ninto it. \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/bronze.html#f3n\" name=\"f3\"><font color=\"#777777\">3</font></a>]</font>\nBut there were moments when he was optimistic.  And\nif we, who were 29 and 30 at the time, could get excited about such\na thoroughly boneheaded idea, we should not be surprised that hackers\naged 21 or 22 are pitching us ideas with little hope of making money.<br/><br/><b>The Still Life Effect</b><br/><br/>Why does this happen?  Why do good hackers have bad business ideas?<br/><br/>Let's look at our case.  One reason we had such a lame idea was\nthat it was the first thing we thought of.  I was in New York trying\nto be a starving artist at the time (the starving part is actually\nquite easy), so I was haunting galleries anyway.  When I learned\nabout the Web, it seemed natural to mix the two.  Make Web sites\nfor galleries—that's the ticket!<br/><br/>If you're going to spend years working on something, you'd think\nit might be wise to spend at least a couple days considering different\nideas, instead of going with the first that comes into your head.\nYou'd think.  But people don't.  In fact, this is a constant problem\nwhen you're painting still lifes.  You plonk down a bunch of stuff\non a table, and maybe spend five or ten minutes rearranging it to \nlook interesting.  But you're so impatient to get started painting\nthat ten minutes of rearranging feels very long.  So you start\npainting.  Three days later, having spent twenty hours staring at\nit, you're kicking yourself for having set up such an awkward and   \nboring composition, but by then it's too late.<br/><br/>Part of the problem is that big projects tend to grow out of small\nones.  You set up a still life to make a quick sketch when you have\na spare hour, and days later you're still working on it.  I once\nspent a month painting three versions of a still life I set up in\nabout four minutes.  At each point (a day, a week, a month) I thought\nI'd already put in so much time that it was too late to change.<br/><br/>So the biggest cause of bad ideas is the still life effect:  you \ncome up with a random idea, plunge into it, and then at each point\n(a day, a week, a month) feel you've put so much time into it that\nthis must be <i>the</i> idea.<br/><br/>How do we fix that?  I don't think we should discard plunging.   \nPlunging into an idea is a good thing.  The solution is at the other\nend: to realize that having invested time in something doesn't make\nit good.<br/><br/>This is clearest in the case of names.  Viaweb was originally\ncalled Webgen, but we discovered someone else had a product called\nthat.  We were so attached to our name that we offered him <i>5%\nof the company</i> if he'd let us have it.   But he wouldn't, so\nwe had to think of another.  \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/bronze.html#f4n\" name=\"f4\"><font color=\"#777777\">4</font></a>]</font>\nThe best we could do was Viaweb,\nwhich we disliked at first.  It was like having a new mother.  But \nwithin three days we loved it, and Webgen sounded lame and\nold-fashioned.<br/><br/>If it's hard to change something so simple as a name, imagine\nhow hard it is to garbage-collect an idea.  A name only has one \npoint of attachment into your head.  An idea for a company gets\nwoven into your thoughts.  So you must consciously discount for   \nthat.  Plunge in, by all means, but remember later to look at your   \nidea in the harsh light of morning and ask: is this something people\nwill pay for?  Is this, of all the things we could make, the thing\npeople will pay most for?<br/><br/><b>Muck</b><br/><br/>The second mistake we made with Artix is also very common.  Putting\ngalleries on the Web seemed cool.<br/><br/>One of the most valuable things my father taught me is an old\nYorkshire saying: where there's muck, there's brass.  Meaning that \nunpleasant work pays.  And more to the point here, vice versa.  Work\npeople like doesn't pay well, for reasons of supply and demand.\nThe most extreme case is developing programming languages, which\ndoesn't pay at all, because people like it so much they do it for \nfree.<br/><br/>When we started Artix, I was still ambivalent about business.  I\nwanted to keep one foot in the art world.  Big, big, mistake.  Going\ninto business is like a hang-glider launch: you'd better do it \nwholeheartedly, or not at all.  The purpose of a company, and a\nstartup especially, is to make money.  You can't have divided\nloyalties.<br/><br/>Which is not to say that you have to do the most disgusting sort  \nof work, like spamming, or starting a company whose only purpose  \nis patent litigation.  What I mean is, if you're starting a company\nthat will do something cool, the aim had better be to make money \nand maybe be cool, not to be cool and maybe make money.<br/><br/>It's hard enough to make money that you can't do it by accident.\nUnless it's your first priority, it's unlikely to happen at all.<br/><br/><b>Hyenas</b><br/><br/>When I probe our motives with Artix, I see a third mistake: timidity.\nIf you'd proposed at the time that we go into the e-commerce business,\nwe'd have found the idea terrifying.  Surely a field like that would\nbe dominated by fearsome startups with five million dollars of VC\nmoney each.  Whereas we felt pretty sure that we could hold our own\nin the slightly less competitive business of generating Web sites \nfor art galleries.<br/><br/>We erred ridiculously far on the side of safety.  As it turns out,\nVC-backed startups are not that fearsome.  They're too busy trying\nto spend all that \n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/venturecapital.html\">money</a> to get software written.  In 1995, the\ne-commerce business was very competitive as measured in press\nreleases, but not as measured in software.  And really it never\nwas.  The big fish like Open Market (rest their souls) were just\nconsulting companies pretending to be product companies \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/bronze.html#f5n\" name=\"f5\"><font color=\"#777777\">5</font></a>]</font>, and  \nthe offerings at our end of the market were a couple hundred lines\nof Perl scripts.  Or could have been implemented as a couple hundred\nlines of Perl; in fact they were probably tens of thousands of lines\nof C++ or Java.  Once we actually took the plunge into e-commerce,\nit turned out to be surprisingly easy to compete.<br/><br/>So why were we afraid?  We felt we were good at programming, but\nwe lacked confidence in our ability to do a mysterious, undifferentiated\nthing we called \"business.\"  In fact there is no such thing as\n\"business.\" There's selling, promotion, figuring out what people\nwant, deciding how much to charge, customer support, paying your\nbills, getting customers to pay you, getting incorporated, raising\nmoney, and so on.  And the combination is not as hard as it seems,   \nbecause some tasks (like raising money and getting incorporated)\nare an O(1) pain in the ass, whether you're big or small, and others\n(like selling and promotion) depend more on energy and imagination\nthan any kind of special training.<br/><br/>Artix was like a hyena, content to survive on carrion because we\nwere afraid of the lions.  Except the lions turned out not to have \nany teeth, and the business of putting galleries online barely\nqualified as carrion.<br/><br/><b>A Familiar Problem</b><br/><br/>Sum up all these sources of error, and it's no wonder we had such\na bad idea for a company.  We did the first thing we thought of;\nwe were ambivalent about being in business at all; and we deliberately\nchose an impoverished market to avoid competition.<br/><br/>Looking at the applications for the Summer Founders Program, I see\nsigns of all three.  But the first is by far the biggest problem.  \nMost of the groups applying have not stopped to ask: of all the \nthings we could do, is <i>this</i> the one with the best chance of\nmaking money?<br/><br/>If they'd already been through their Artix phase, they'd have learned\nto ask that.  After the reception we got from art dealers, we were\nready to.  This time, we thought, let's make something people want.<br/><br/>Reading the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> for a week should give anyone\nideas for two or three new startups.  The articles are full of\ndescriptions of problems that need to be solved.  But most of the\napplicants don't seem to have looked far for ideas.<br/><br/>We expected the most common proposal to be for multiplayer games.\nWe were not far off: this was the second most common. \nThe most common was some combination of a blog, a calendar,\na dating site, and Friendster.  Maybe there is some new killer app\nto be discovered here, but it seems perverse to go poking around\nin this fog when there are valuable, unsolved problems lying about\nin the open for anyone to see.  Why did no one propose a new scheme   \nfor micropayments?  An ambitious project, perhaps, but I can't    \nbelieve we've considered every alternative.  And newspapers and\nmagazines are (literally) dying for a solution.<br/><br/>Why did so few applicants really think about what customers want?\nI think the problem with many, as with people in their early twenties\ngenerally, is that they've been trained their whole lives to jump\nthrough predefined hoops.  They've spent 15-20 years solving problems\nother people have set for them.  And how much time deciding what  \nproblems would be good to solve?  Two or three course projects?   \n<!-- Robert is one of us trying to rank the applications.  He's a professor\nnow, and he said recently that reading the proposals felt awfully \nfamiliar.  -->\nThey're good at solving problems, but bad at choosing them.<br/><br/>But that, I'm convinced, is just the effect of training.  Or more\nprecisely, the effect of grading.  To make grading efficient,\neveryone has to solve the same problem, and that means it has to\nbe decided in advance.  It would be great if schools taught students\nhow to choose problems as well as how to solve them, but I don't\nknow how you'd run such a class in practice.<br/><br/><b>Copper and Tin</b><br/><br/>The good news is, choosing problems is something that can be learned.\nI know that from experience.  Hackers can learn to make things\ncustomers want. \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/bronze.html#f6n\" name=\"f6\"><font color=\"#777777\">6</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>This is a controversial view.  One expert on \"entrepreneurship\"\ntold me that any startup had to include business people, because\nonly they could focus on what customers wanted.  I'll probably\nalienate this guy forever by quoting him, but I have to risk it,\nbecause his email was such a perfect example of this view:\n<blockquote> \n  80% of MIT spinoffs succeed <i>provided</i> they \n  have at least one management person in the team at the start. The   \n  business person represents the \"voice of the customer\" and that's\n  what keeps the engineers and product development on track.\n</blockquote>\nThis is, in my opinion, a crock.  Hackers are perfectly capable of\nhearing the voice of the customer without a business person to\namplify the signal for them.  Larry Page and Sergey Brin were grad\nstudents in computer science, which presumably makes them \"engineers.\"\nDo you suppose Google is only good because they had some business\nguy whispering in their ears what customers wanted?   It seems to \nme the business guys who did the most for Google were the ones who \nobligingly flew Altavista into a hillside just as Google was getting\nstarted.<br/><br/>The hard part about figuring out what customers want is figuring \nout that you need to figure it out.  But that's something you can\nlearn quickly.  It's like seeing the other interpretation of an\nambiguous picture.  As soon as someone tells you there's a rabbit\nas well as a duck, it's hard not to see it.<br/><br/>And compared to the sort of problems hackers are used to solving,\ngiving customers what they want is easy.  Anyone who can write an \noptimizing compiler can design a UI that doesn't confuse users, \nonce they <i>choose</i> to focus on that problem.  And once you   \napply that kind of brain power to petty but profitable questions,     \nyou can create wealth very rapidly.<br/><br/>That's the essence of a startup: having brilliant people do work\nthat's beneath them.   Big companies try to hire the right person\nfor the job.  Startups win because they don't—because they take\npeople so smart that they would in a big company be doing \"research,\"\nand set them to work instead on problems of the most immediate and\nmundane sort.  Think Einstein designing refrigerators.\n<font color=\"#555555\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/bronze.html#f7n\" name=\"f7\"><font color=\"#555555\">7</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>If you want to learn what people want, read\nDale Carnegie's <i>How to Win Friends and Influence People.</i>\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/bronze.html#f8n\" name=\"f8\"><font color=\"#777777\">8</font></a>]</font>\nWhen a friend recommended this book, I couldn't believe he was\nserious.  But he insisted it was good, so I read it, and he was   \nright.  It deals with the most difficult problem in human experience:\nhow to see things from other people's point of view, instead of\nthinking only of yourself.<br/><br/>Most smart people don't do that very well.  But adding this ability\nto raw brainpower is like adding tin to copper.  The result is\nbronze, which is so much harder that it seems a different metal.<br/><br/>A hacker who has learned what to make, and not just how to make,\nis extraordinarily powerful.  And not just at making money: look\nwhat a small group of volunteers has achieved with Firefox.<br/><br/>Doing an Artix teaches you to make something people want in the\nsame way that not drinking anything would teach you how much you\ndepend on water.  But it would be more convenient for all involved\nif the Summer Founders didn't learn this on our dime—if they could\nskip the Artix phase and go right on to make something customers\nwanted.  That, I think, is going to be the real experiment this \nsummer.  How long will it take them to grasp this?<br/><br/><!--With us beating it into their heads constantly, that is.-->  We decided\nwe ought to have T-Shirts for the SFP, and we'd been thinking about   \nwhat to print on the back.
