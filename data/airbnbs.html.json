{"href":"airbnbs.html","title":"The Airbnbs","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">December 2020<br/><br/>To celebrate Airbnb's IPO and to help future founders, I thought\nit might be useful to explain what was special about Airbnb.<br/><br/>What was special about the Airbnbs was how earnest they were. They\ndid nothing half-way, and we could sense this even in the interview.\nSometimes after we interviewed a startup we'd be uncertain what to\ndo, and have to talk it over. Other times we'd just look at one\nanother and smile. The Airbnbs' interview was that kind. We didn't\neven like the idea that much. Nor did users, at that stage; they\nhad no growth. But the founders seemed so full of energy that it\nwas impossible not to like them.<br/><br/>That first impression was not misleading. During the batch our\nnickname for Brian Chesky was The Tasmanian Devil, because like the\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StG2u5qfFRg&amp;t=2m27s\">cartoon\ncharacter</a> he seemed a tornado of energy. All three of them were\nlike that. No one ever worked harder during YC than the Airbnbs\ndid. When you talked to the Airbnbs, they took notes. If you suggested\nan idea to them in office hours, the next time you talked to them\nthey'd not only have implemented it, but also implemented two new\nideas they had in the process. \"They probably have the best attitude\nof any startup we've funded\" I wrote to Mike Arrington during the\nbatch.<br/><br/>They're still like that. Jessica and I had dinner with Brian in the\nsummer of 2018, just the three of us. By this point the company is\nten years old. He took a page of notes about ideas for new things\nAirbnb could do.<br/><br/>What we didn't realize when we first met Brian and Joe and Nate was\nthat Airbnb was on its last legs. After working on the company for\na year and getting no growth, they'd agreed to give it one last\nshot. They'd try this Y Combinator thing, and if the company still\ndidn't take off, they'd give up.<br/><br/>Any normal person would have given up already. They'd been funding\nthe company with credit cards. They had a <i>binder</i> full of\ncredit cards they'd maxed out. Investors didn't think much of the\nidea. One investor they met in a cafe walked out in the middle of\nmeeting with them. They thought he was going to the bathroom, but\nhe never came back. \"He didn't even finish his smoothie,\" Brian\nsaid. And now, in late 2008, it was the worst recession in decades.\nThe stock market was in free fall and wouldn't hit bottom for another\nfour months.<br/><br/>Why hadn't they given up? This is a useful question to ask. People,\nlike matter, reveal their nature under extreme conditions. One thing\nthat's clear is that they weren't doing this just for the money.\nAs a money-making scheme, this was pretty lousy: a year's work and\nall they had to show for it was a binder full of maxed-out credit\ncards. So why were they still working on this startup? Because of\nthe experience they'd had as the first hosts.<br/><br/>When they first tried renting out airbeds on their floor during a\ndesign convention, all they were hoping for was to make enough money\nto pay their rent that month. But something surprising happened:\nthey enjoyed having those first three guests staying with them. And\nthe guests enjoyed it too. Both they and the guests had done it\nbecause they were in a sense forced to, and yet they'd all had a\ngreat experience. Clearly there was something new here: for hosts,\na new way to make money that had literally been right under their\nnoses, and for guests, a new way to travel that was in many ways\nbetter than hotels.<br/><br/>That experience was why the Airbnbs didn't give up. They knew they'd\ndiscovered something. They'd seen a glimpse of the future, and they\ncouldn't let it go.<br/><br/>They knew that once people tried staying in what is now called \"an\nairbnb,\" they would also realize that this was the future. But only\nif they tried it, and they weren't. That was the problem during Y\nCombinator: to get growth started.<br/><br/>Airbnb's goal during YC was to reach what we call <a href=\"http://paulgraham.com/ramenprofitable.html\">ramen profitability</a>,\nwhich means making enough money that the company can pay the founders'\nliving expenses, if they live on ramen noodles. Ramen profitability\nis not, obviously, the end goal of any startup, but it's the most\nimportant threshold on the way, because this is the point where\nyou're airborne. This is the point where you no longer need investors'\npermission to continue existing. For the Airbnbs, ramen profitability\nwas $4000 a month: $3500 for rent, and $500 for food. They taped\nthis goal to the mirror in the bathroom of their apartment.<br/><br/>The way to get growth started in something like Airbnb is to focus\non the hottest subset of the market. If you can get growth started\nthere, it will spread to the rest. When I asked the Airbnbs where\nthere was most demand, they knew from searches: New York City. So\nthey focused on New York. They went there <a href=\"http://paulgraham.com/ds.html\">in person</a> to visit their\nhosts and help them make their listings more attractive. A big part\nof that was better pictures. So Joe and Brian rented a professional\ncamera and took pictures of the hosts' places themselves.<br/><br/>This didn't just make the listings better. It also taught them about\ntheir hosts. When they came back from their first trip to New York,\nI asked what they'd noticed about hosts that surprised them, and\nthey said the biggest surprise was how many of the hosts were in\nthe same position they'd been in: they needed this money to pay\ntheir rent. This was, remember, the worst recession in decades, and\nit had hit New York first. It definitely added to the Airbnbs' sense\nof mission to feel that people needed them.<br/><br/>In late January 2009, about three weeks into Y Combinator, their\nefforts started to show results, and their numbers crept upward.\nBut it was hard to say for sure whether it was growth or just random\nfluctuation. By February it was clear that it was real growth. They\nmade $460 in fees in the first week of February, $897 in the second,\nand $1428 in the third. That was it: they were airborne. Brian sent\nme an email on February 22 announcing that they were ramen profitable\nand giving the last three weeks' numbers.<br/><br/>\"I assume you know what you've now set yourself up for next week,\"\nI responded.<br/><br/>Brian's reply was seven words: \"We are not going to slow down.\"<br/><br/></font>","date":"2020-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
