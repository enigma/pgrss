{"href":"property.html","title":"Defining Property","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">March 2012<br/><br/>As a child I read a book of stories about a famous judge in eighteenth\ncentury Japan called Ooka Tadasuke.  One of the cases he decided\nwas brought by the owner of a food shop.  A poor student who could\nafford only rice was eating his rice while enjoying the delicious\ncooking smells coming from the food shop.  The owner wanted the\nstudent to pay for the smells he was enjoying.<br/><br/>The student was\nstealing his smells!<br/><br/>This story often comes to mind when I hear the RIAA and MPAA accusing\npeople of stealing music and movies.<br/><br/>It sounds ridiculous to us to treat smells as property.  But I can\nimagine scenarios in which one could charge for smells.  Imagine\nwe were living on a moon base where we had to buy air by the\nliter.  I could imagine air suppliers adding scents at an extra\ncharge.<br/><br/>The reason it seems ridiculous to us to treat smells as property\nis that it wouldn't work to.  It would work on a moon base, though.<br/><br/>What counts as property depends on what works to treat as property.\nAnd that not only can change, but has changed.  Humans may always\n(for some definition of human and always) have treated small items\ncarried on one's person as property.  But hunter gatherers didn't\ntreat land, for example, as property in the way we do.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f1n\"><font color=\"#999999\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The reason so many people think of property as having a single\nunchanging definition is that its definition changes very slowly.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f2n\"><font color=\"#999999\">2</font></a>]</font>\nBut we are in the midst of such a change now.  The record\nlabels and movie studios used to distribute what they made like air\nshipped through tubes on a moon base.  But with the arrival of\nnetworks, it's as if we've moved to a planet with a breathable\natmosphere.  Data moves like smells now.  And through a combination\nof wishful thinking and short-term greed, the labels and studios\nhave put themselves in the position of the food shop owner, accusing\nus all of stealing their smells.<br/><br/>(The reason I say short-term greed is that the underlying problem\nwith the labels and studios is that the people who run them are\ndriven by bonuses rather than equity.  If they were driven by equity\nthey'd be looking for ways to take advantage of technological change\ninstead of fighting it.  But building new things takes too long.\nTheir bonuses depend on this year's revenues, and the best way to\nincrease those is to extract more money from stuff they do already.)<br/><br/>So what does this mean?  Should people not be able to charge for\ncontent?  There's not a single yes or no answer to that question.\nPeople should be able to charge for content when it works to charge\nfor content.<br/><br/>But by \"works\" I mean something more subtle than \"when they can get\naway with it.\"  I mean when people can charge for content without\nwarping society in order to do it.  After all, the companies selling\nsmells on the moon base could continue to sell them on the Earth,\nif they lobbied successfully for laws requiring us all to continue\nto breathe through tubes down here too, even though we no longer\nneeded to.<br/><br/>The crazy legal measures that the labels and studios have been\ntaking have a lot of that flavor.  Newspapers and magazines are\njust as screwed, but they are at least declining gracefully.  The\nRIAA and MPAA would make us breathe through tubes if they could.<br/><br/>Ultimately it comes down to common sense.  When you're abusing the\nlegal system by trying to use mass lawsuits against randomly chosen\npeople as a form of exemplary punishment, or lobbying for laws\nthat would break the Internet if they passed, that's ipso facto\nevidence you're using a definition of property that doesn't work.<br/><br/>This is where it's helpful to have working democracies and multiple\nsovereign countries.  If the world had a single, autocratic government,\nthe labels and studios could buy laws making the definition of\nproperty be whatever they wanted.  But fortunately there are still\nsome countries that are not copyright colonies of the US, and even\nin the US, <a href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/congress-on-sopa-done.png\">politicians</a>\nstill seem to be afraid of actual voters, in sufficient numbers.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f3n\"><font color=\"#999999\">3</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The people running the US may not like it when voters or other\ncountries refuse to bend to their will, but ultimately it's in all\nour interest that there's not a single point of attack for people\ntrying to warp the law to serve their own purposes.  Private property\nis an extremely useful idea â€” arguably one of our greatest inventions.\nSo far, each new definition of it has brought us increasing material\nwealth.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f4n\"><font color=\"#999999\">4</font></a>]</font>\nIt seems reasonable to suppose the newest one will\ntoo.  It would be a disaster if we all had to keep running an\nobsolete version just because a few powerful people were too lazy\nto upgrade.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nIf you want to learn more about hunter gatherers I strongly\nrecommend Elizabeth Marshall Thomas's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Harmless-People-Elizabeth-Marshall-Thomas/dp/0394427793\"><i>The\nHarmless People</i></a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Old-Way-Story-First-People/dp/0374225524\"><i>The\nOld Way</i></a>.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nChange in the definition of property is driven mostly by\ntechnological progress, however, and since technological progress\nis accelerating, so presumably will the rate of change in the\ndefinition of property.  Which means it's all the more important\nfor societies to be able to respond gracefully to such changes,\nbecause they will come at an ever increasing rate.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nAs far as I know, the term \"copyright colony\" was first used\nby <a href=\"http://torrentfreak.com/australia-us-copyright-colony-or-just-a-good-friend-120121/\">Myles\nPeterson</a>.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f4n\"><font color=\"#000000\">4</font></a>]\nThe state of technology isn't simply a function of\nthe definition of property.  They each constrain the other.  But\nthat being so, you can't mess with the definition of property without\naffecting (and probably harming) the state of technology.  The\nhistory of the USSR offers a vivid illustration of that.<br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman and Geoff Ralston for reading drafts\nof this.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2012-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
