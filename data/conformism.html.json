{"href":"conformism.html","title":"The Four Quadrants of Conformism","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">July 2020<br/><br/>One of the most revealing ways to classify people is by the degree\nand aggressiveness of their conformism. Imagine a Cartesian coordinate\nsystem whose horizontal axis runs from conventional-minded on the\nleft to independent-minded on the right, and whose vertical axis\nruns from passive at the bottom to aggressive at the top. The\nresulting four quadrants define four types of people. Starting in\nthe upper left and going counter-clockwise: aggressively\nconventional-minded, passively conventional-minded, passively\nindependent-minded, and aggressively independent-minded.<br/><br/>I think that you'll find all four types in most societies, and that\nwhich quadrant people fall into depends more on their own personality\nthan the beliefs prevalent in their society.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"#f1n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Young children offer some of the best evidence for both points.\nAnyone who's been to primary school has seen the four types, and\nthe fact that school rules are so arbitrary is strong evidence that\nwhich quadrant people fall into depends more on them than the rules.<br/><br/>The kids in the upper left quadrant, the aggressively conventional-minded\nones, are the tattletales. They believe not only that rules must\nbe obeyed, but that those who disobey them must be punished.<br/><br/>The kids in the lower left quadrant, the passively conventional-minded,\nare the sheep. They're careful to obey the rules, but when other\nkids break them, their impulse is to worry that those kids will be\npunished, not to ensure that they will.<br/><br/>The kids in the lower right quadrant, the passively independent-minded,\nare the dreamy ones. They don't care much about rules and probably\naren't 100% sure what the rules even are.<br/><br/>And the kids in the upper right quadrant, the aggressively\nindependent-minded, are the naughty ones. When they see a rule,\ntheir first impulse is to question it. Merely being told what to\ndo makes them inclined to do the opposite.<br/><br/>When measuring conformism, of course, you have to say with respect\nto what, and this changes as kids get older. For younger kids it's\nthe rules set by adults. But as kids get older, the source of rules\nbecomes their peers. So a pack of teenagers who all flout school\nrules in the same way are not independent-minded; rather the opposite.<br/><br/>In adulthood we can recognize the four types by their distinctive\ncalls, much as you could recognize four species of birds. The call\nof the aggressively conventional-minded is \"Crush &lt;outgroup&gt;!\" (It's\nrather alarming to see an exclamation point after a variable, but\nthat's the whole problem with the aggressively conventional-minded.)\nThe call of the passively conventional-minded is \"What will the\nneighbors think?\" The call of the passively independent-minded is\n\"To each his own.\" And the call of the aggressively independent-minded\nis \"Eppur si muove.\"<br/><br/>The four types are not equally common. There are more passive people\nthan aggressive ones, and far more conventional-minded people than\nindependent-minded ones. So the passively conventional-minded are\nthe largest group, and the aggressively independent-minded the\nsmallest.<br/><br/>Since one's quadrant depends more on one's personality than the\nnature of the rules, most people would occupy the same quadrant\neven if they'd grown up in a quite different society.<br/><br/>Princeton professor Robert George recently wrote:\n<blockquote>\n   I sometimes ask students what their position on slavery would\n   have been had they been white and living in the South before\n   abolition. Guess what? They all would have been abolitionists!\n   They all would have bravely spoken out against slavery, and\n   worked tirelessly against it.\n</blockquote>\nHe's too polite to say so, but of course they wouldn't. And indeed,\nour default assumption should not merely be that his students would,\non average, have behaved the same way people did at the time, but\nthat the ones who are aggressively conventional-minded today would\nhave been aggressively conventional-minded then too. In other words,\nthat they'd not only not have fought against slavery, but that\nthey'd have been among its staunchest defenders.<br/><br/>I'm biased, I admit, but it seems to me that aggressively\nconventional-minded people are responsible for a disproportionate\namount of the trouble in the world, and that a lot of the customs\nwe've evolved since the Enlightenment have been designed to protect\nthe rest of us from them. In particular, the retirement of the\nconcept of heresy and its replacement by the principle of freely\ndebating all sorts of different ideas, even ones that are currently\nconsidered unacceptable, without any punishment for those who try\nthem out to see if they work.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"#f2n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Why do the independent-minded need to be protected, though? Because\nthey have all the new ideas. To be a successful scientist, for\nexample, it's not enough just to be right. You have to be right\nwhen everyone else is wrong. Conventional-minded people can't do\nthat. For similar reasons, all successful startup CEOs are not\nmerely independent-minded, but aggressively so. So it's no coincidence\nthat societies prosper only to the extent that they have customs\nfor keeping the conventional-minded at bay.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"#f3n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">3</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>In the last few years, many of us have noticed that the customs\nprotecting free inquiry have been weakened. Some say we're overreacting\n that they haven't been weakened very much, or that they've been\nweakened in the service of a greater good. The latter I'll dispose\nof immediately. When the conventional-minded get the upper hand,\nthey always say it's in the service of a greater good.  It just\nhappens to be a different, incompatible greater good each time.<br/><br/>As for the former worry, that the independent-minded are being\noversensitive, and that free inquiry hasn't been shut down that\nmuch, you can't judge that unless you are yourself independent-minded.\nYou can't know how much of the space of ideas is being lopped off\nunless you have them, and only the independent-minded have the ones\nat the edges. Precisely because of this, they tend to be very\nsensitive to changes in how freely one can explore ideas. They're\nthe canaries in this coalmine.<br/><br/>The conventional-minded say, as they always do, that they don't\nwant to shut down the discussion of all ideas, just the bad ones.<br/><br/>You'd think it would be obvious just from that sentence what a\ndangerous game they're playing. But I'll spell it out. There are\ntwo reasons why we need to be able to discuss even \"bad\" ideas.<br/><br/>The first is that any process for deciding which ideas to ban is\nbound to make mistakes. All the more so because no one intelligent\nwants to undertake that kind of work, so it ends up being done by\nthe stupid. And when a process makes a lot of mistakes, you need\nto leave a margin for error. Which in this case means you need to\nban fewer ideas than you'd like to. But that's hard for the\naggressively conventional-minded to do, partly because they enjoy\nseeing people punished, as they have since they were children, and\npartly because they compete with one another. Enforcers of orthodoxy\ncan't allow a borderline idea to exist, because that gives other\nenforcers an opportunity to one-up them in the moral purity department,\nand perhaps even to turn enforcer upon them. So instead of getting\nthe margin for error we need, we get the opposite: a race to the\nbottom in which any idea that seems at all bannable ends up being\nbanned. \n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"#f4n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">4</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The second reason it's dangerous to ban the discussion of ideas is\nthat ideas are more closely related than they look. Which means if\nyou restrict the discussion of some topics, it doesn't only affect\nthose topics. The restrictions propagate back into any topic that\nyields implications in the forbidden ones. And that is not an edge\ncase. The best ideas do exactly that: they have consequences\nin fields far removed from their origins. Having ideas in a world\nwhere some ideas are banned is like playing soccer on a pitch that\nhas a minefield in one corner. You don't just play the same game\nyou would have, but on a different shaped pitch. You play a much\nmore subdued game even on the ground that's safe.<br/><br/>In the past, the way the independent-minded protected themselves\nwas to congregate in a handful of places   first in courts, and\nlater in universities  where they could to some extent make their\nown rules. Places where people work with ideas tend to have customs\nprotecting free inquiry, for the same reason wafer fabs have powerful\nair filters, or recording studios good sound insulation. For the\nlast couple centuries at least, when the aggressively conventional-minded\nwere on the rampage for whatever reason, universities were the\nsafest places to be.<br/><br/>That may not work this time though, due to the unfortunate fact\nthat the latest wave of intolerance began in universities. It began\nin the mid 1980s, and by 2000 seemed to have died down, but it has\nrecently flared up again with the arrival of social media. This\nseems, unfortunately, to have been an own goal by Silicon Valley.\nThough the people who run Silicon Valley are almost all independent-minded,\nthey've handed the aggressively conventional-minded a tool such as\nthey could only have dreamed of.<br/><br/>On the other hand, perhaps the decline in the spirit of free inquiry\nwithin universities is as much the symptom of the departure of the\nindependent-minded as the cause. People who would have become\nprofessors 50 years ago have other options now. Now they can become\nquants or start startups. You have to be independent-minded to\nsucceed at either of those. If these people had been professors,\nthey'd have put up a stiffer resistance on behalf of academic\nfreedom. So perhaps the picture of the independent-minded fleeing\ndeclining universities is too gloomy. Perhaps the universities are\ndeclining because so many have already left.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"#f5n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">5</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Though I've spent a lot of time thinking about this situation, I\ncan't predict how it plays out. Could some universities reverse the\ncurrent trend and remain places where the independent-minded want\nto congregate? Or will the independent-minded gradually abandon\nthem? I worry a lot about what we might lose if that happened.<br/><br/>But I'm hopeful long term. The independent-minded are good at\nprotecting themselves. If existing institutions are compromised,\nthey'll create new ones. That may require some imagination. But\nimagination is, after all, their specialty.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nI realize of course that if people's personalities vary in any\ntwo ways, you can use them as axes and call the resulting four\nquadrants personality types. So what I'm really claiming is that\nthe axes are orthogonal and that there's significant variation in\nboth.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nThe aggressively conventional-minded aren't responsible for all\nthe trouble in the world. Another big source of trouble is the sort\nof charismatic leader who gains power by appealing to them. They\nbecome much more dangerous when such leaders emerge.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nI never worried about writing things that offended the\nconventional-minded when I was running Y Combinator. If YC were a\ncookie company, I'd have faced a difficult moral choice.\nConventional-minded people eat cookies too. But they don't start\nsuccessful startups. So if I deterred them from applying to YC, the\nonly effect was to save us work reading applications.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f4n\"><font color=\"#000000\">4</font></a>]\nThere has been progress in one area: the punishments for talking\nabout banned ideas are less severe than in the past. There's little\ndanger of being killed, at least in richer countries. The aggressively\nconventional-minded are mostly satisfied with getting people fired.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f5n\"><font color=\"#000000\">5</font></a>]\nMany professors are independent-minded  especially in math,\nthe hard sciences, and engineering, where you have to be to succeed.\nBut students are more representative of the general population, and\nthus mostly conventional-minded. So when professors and students\nare in conflict, it's not just a conflict between generations but\nalso between different types of people.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Nicholas Christakis, Patrick\nCollison, Sam Gichuru, Jessica Livingston, Patrick McKenzie, Geoff\nRalston, and Harj Taggar for reading drafts of this.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2020-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
