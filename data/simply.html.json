{"href":"simply.html","title":"Write Simply","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">March 2021<br/><br/>I try to write using ordinary words and simple sentences.<br/><br/>That kind of writing is easier to read, and the easier something\nis to read, the more deeply readers will engage with it. The less\nenergy they expend on your prose, the more they'll have left for\nyour ideas.<br/><br/>And the further they'll read. Most readers' energy tends to flag\npart way through an article or essay. If the friction of reading\nis low enough, more keep going till the end.<br/><br/>There's an Italian dish called <i>saltimbocca</i>, which means \"leap\ninto the mouth.\" My goal when writing might be called <i>saltintesta</i>:\nthe ideas leap into your head and you barely notice the words that\ngot them there.<br/><br/>It's too much to hope that writing could ever be pure ideas. You\nmight not even want it to be. But for most writers, most of the\ntime, that's the goal to aim for. The gap between most writing and\npure ideas is not filled with poetry.<br/><br/>Plus it's more considerate to write simply. When you write in a\nfancy way to impress people, you're making them do extra work just\nso you can seem cool. It's like trailing a long train behind you\nthat readers have to carry.<br/><br/>And remember, if you're writing in English, that a lot of your\nreaders won't be native English speakers. Their understanding of\nideas may be way ahead of their understanding of English. So you\ncan't assume that writing about a difficult topic means you can\nuse difficult words.<br/><br/>Of course, fancy writing doesn't just conceal ideas. It can also\nconceal the lack of them. That's why some people write that way,\nto conceal the fact that they have \n<a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=hermeneutic+dialectics+hegemonic+modalities\"><u></u></a> nothing to say. Whereas writing\nsimply keeps you honest. If you say nothing simply, it will be\nobvious to everyone, including you.<br/><br/>Simple writing also lasts better. People reading your stuff in the\nfuture will be in much the same position as people from other\ncountries reading it today. The culture and the language will have\nchanged. It's not vain to care about that, any more than it's vain\nfor a woodworker to build a chair to last.<br/><br/>Indeed, lasting is not merely an accidental quality of chairs, or\nwriting. It's a sign you did a good job.<br/><br/>But although these are all real advantages of writing simply, none\nof them are why I do it. The main reason I write simply is that it\noffends me not to. When I write a sentence that seems too complicated,\nor that uses unnecessarily intellectual words, it doesn't seem fancy\nto me. It seems clumsy.<br/><br/>There are of course times when you want to use a complicated sentence\nor fancy word for effect. But you should never do it by accident.<br/><br/>The other reason my writing ends up being simple is the way I do\nit. I write the first draft fast, then spend days editing it, trying\nto get everything just right. Much of this editing is cutting, and\nthat makes simple writing even simpler.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2021-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
