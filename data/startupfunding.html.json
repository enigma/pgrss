In effect we're open-sourcing the kernel of\nwhat we tell founders about funding at <nota href=\"http://ycombinator.com\">Y\nCombinator</a>.)</i>\n-->\nVenture funding works like gears.  A typical startup goes through\nseveral rounds of funding, and at each round you want to take just\nenough money to reach the speed where you can shift into the next\ngear.<br/><br/>Few startups get it quite right.  Many are underfunded.  A few are\noverfunded, which is like trying to start driving in third gear.<br/><br/>I think it would help founders to understand funding better—not\njust the mechanics of it, but what investors are thinking.  I was\nsurprised recently when I realized that all the worst problems we\nfaced in our startup were due not to competitors, but investors.\nDealing with competitors was easy by comparison.<br/><br/>I don't mean to suggest that our investors were nothing but a drag\non us.  They were helpful in negotiating deals, for example.  I\nmean more that conflicts with investors are particularly nasty.\nCompetitors punch you in the jaw, but investors have you by the\nballs.<br/><br/>Apparently our situation was not unusual.  And if trouble with\ninvestors is one of the biggest threats to a startup, managing them\nis one of the most important skills founders need to learn.<br/><br/>Let's start by talking about the five sources of startup funding.\nThen we'll trace the life of a hypothetical (very fortunate) startup\nas it shifts gears through successive rounds.<br/><br/><b>Friends and Family</b><br/><br/>A lot of startups get their first funding from friends and family.\nExcite did, for example: after the founders graduated from college,\nthey borrowed $15,000 from their parents to start a company.  With\nthe help of some part-time jobs they made it last 18 months.<br/><br/>If your friends or family happen to be rich, the line blurs between\nthem and angel investors.  At Viaweb we got our first $10,000 of\nseed money from our friend Julian, but he was sufficiently rich\nthat it's hard to say whether he should be classified as a friend\nor angel.  He was also a lawyer, which was great, because it meant\nwe didn't have to pay legal bills out of that initial small sum.<br/><br/>The advantage of raising money from friends and family is that\nthey're easy to find.  You already know them.  There are three main\ndisadvantages: you mix together your business and personal life;\nthey will probably not be as well connected as angels or venture\nfirms; and they may not be accredited investors, which could\ncomplicate your life later.<br/><br/>The SEC defines an \"accredited investor\" as someone with over a\nmillion dollars in liquid assets or an income of over $200,000 a\nyear.  The regulatory burden is much lower if a company's shareholders\nare all accredited investors.  Once you take money from the general\npublic you're more restricted in what you can do. \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f1n\"><font color=\"#777777\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>A startup's life will be more complicated, legally, if any of the\ninvestors aren't accredited.  In an IPO, it might not merely add\nexpense, but change the outcome. A lawyer I asked about it said:\n<blockquote>\n  When the company goes public, the SEC will carefully study all\n  prior issuances of stock by the company and demand that it take\n  immediate action to cure any past violations of securities laws.\n  Those remedial actions can delay, stall or even kill the IPO.\n</blockquote>\nOf course the odds of any given startup doing an IPO are small.\nBut not as small as they might seem. A lot of startups that end up\ngoing public didn't seem likely to at first. (Who could have guessed\nthat the company Wozniak and Jobs started in their spare time selling\nplans for microcomputers would yield one of the biggest IPOs of the\ndecade?) Much of the value of a startup consists of that tiny\nprobability multiplied by the huge outcome.<br/><br/>It wasn't because they weren't accredited investors that I didn't\nask my parents for seed money, though.  When we were starting Viaweb,\nI didn't know about the concept of an accredited investor, and\ndidn't stop to think about the value of investors' connections.\nThe reason I didn't take money from my parents was that I didn't\nwant them to lose it.<br/><br/><b>Consulting</b><br/><br/>Another way to fund a startup is to get a job.  The best sort of\njob is a consulting project in which you can build whatever software\nyou wanted to sell as a startup.  Then you can gradually transform\nyourself from a consulting company into a product company, and have\nyour clients pay your development expenses.<br/><br/>This is a good plan for someone with kids, because it takes most\nof the risk out of starting a startup.  There never has to be a\ntime when you have no revenues.  Risk and reward are usually\nproportionate, however: you should expect a plan that cuts the risk\nof starting a startup also to cut the average return.  In this case,\nyou trade decreased financial risk for increased risk that your\ncompany won't succeed as a startup.<br/><br/>But isn't the consulting company itself a startup?  No, not generally.\nA company has to be more than small and newly founded to be a\nstartup.  There are millions of small businesses in America, but\nonly a few thousand are startups.  To be a startup, a company has\nto be a product business, not a service business.  By which I mean\nnot that it has to make something physical, but that it has to have\none thing it sells to many people, rather than doing custom work\nfor individual clients.  Custom work doesn't scale.  To be a startup\nyou need to be the band that sells a million copies of a song, not\nthe band that makes money by playing at individual weddings and bar\nmitzvahs.<br/><br/>The trouble with consulting is that clients have an awkward habit\nof calling you on the phone.  Most startups operate close to the\nmargin of failure, and the distraction of having to deal with clients\ncould be enough to put you over the edge.  Especially if you have\ncompetitors who get to work full time on just being a startup.<br/><br/>So you have to be very disciplined if you take the consulting route.\nYou have to work actively to prevent your company growing into a\n\"weed tree,\" dependent on this source of easy but low-margin money.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f2n\"><font color=\"#777777\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Indeed, the biggest danger of consulting may be that it gives you\nan excuse for failure.  In a startup, as in grad school, a lot of\nwhat ends up driving you are the expectations of your family and\nfriends.  Once you start a startup and tell everyone that's what\nyou're doing, you're now on a path labelled \"get rich or bust.\" You\nnow have to get rich, or you've failed.<br/><br/>Fear of failure is an extraordinarily powerful force.  Usually it\nprevents people from starting things, but once you publish some\ndefinite ambition, it switches directions and starts working in\nyour favor.  I think it's a pretty clever piece of jiujitsu to set\nthis irresistible force against the slightly less immovable object\nof becoming rich.  You won't have it driving you if your stated\nambition is merely to start a consulting company that you will one\nday morph into a startup.<br/><br/>An advantage of consulting, as a way to develop a product, is that\nyou know you're making something at least one customer wants.  But\nif you have what it takes to start a startup you should have\nsufficient vision not to need this crutch.<br/><br/><b>Angel Investors</b><br/><br/><i>Angels</i> are individual rich people.  The word was first used\nfor backers of Broadway plays, but now applies to individual investors\ngenerally.  Angels who've made money in technology are preferable,\nfor two reasons: they understand your situation, and they're a\nsource of contacts and advice.<br/><br/>The contacts and advice can be more important than the money.  When\ndel.icio.us took money from investors, they took money from, among\nothers, Tim O'Reilly.  The amount he put in was small compared to\nthe VCs who led the round, but Tim is a smart and influential guy\nand it's good to have him on your side.<br/><br/>You can do whatever you want with money from consulting or friends\nand family.  With angels we're now talking about venture funding\nproper, so it's time to introduce the concept of <i>exit strategy</i>.\nYounger would-be founders are often surprised that investors expect\nthem either to sell the company or go public.  The reason is that\ninvestors need to get their capital back.  They'll only consider\ncompanies that have an exit strategy—meaning companies that could\nget bought or go public.<br/><br/>This is not as selfish as it sounds.  There are few large, private\ntechnology companies.  Those that don't fail all seem to get bought\nor go public.  The reason is that employees are investors too—of\ntheir time—and they want just as much to be able to cash out.  If\nyour competitors offer employees stock options that might make them\nrich, while you make it clear you plan to stay private, your\ncompetitors will get the best people. So the principle of an \"exit\"\nis not just something forced on startups by investors, but part of\nwhat it means to be a startup.<br/><br/>Another concept we need to introduce now is valuation.  When someone\nbuys shares in a company, that implicitly establishes a value for\nit.  If someone pays $20,000 for 10% of a company, the company is\nin theory worth $200,000.  I say \"in theory\" because in early stage\ninvesting, valuations are voodoo.  As a company gets more established,\nits valuation gets closer to an actual market value.  But in a newly\nfounded startup, the valuation number is just an artifact of the\nrespective contributions of everyone involved.<br/><br/>Startups often \"pay\" investors who will help the company in some\nway by letting them invest at low valuations.  If I had a startup\nand Steve Jobs wanted to invest in it, I'd give him the stock for\n$10, just to be able to brag that he was an investor.  Unfortunately,\nit's impractical (if not illegal) to adjust the valuation of the\ncompany up and down for each investor.  Startups' valuations are\nsupposed to rise over time.  So if you're going to sell cheap stock\nto eminent angels, do it early, when it's natural for the company\nto have a low valuation.<br/><br/>Some angel investors join together in syndicates.  Any city where\npeople start startups will have one or more of them.  In Boston the\nbiggest is the <a href=\"http://commonangels.com/home.html\">Common\nAngels</a>.  In the Bay Area it's the <a href=\"http://bandangels.com/\">Band\nof Angels</a>.  You can find groups near you through the <a href=\"http://angelcapitalassociation.org/\">Angel Capital Association</a>.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f3n\"><font color=\"#777777\">3</font></a>]</font>\nHowever, most angel investors don't belong to these groups.  In\nfact, the more prominent the angel, the less likely they are to\nbelong to a group.<br/><br/>Some angel groups charge you money to pitch your idea to them.\nNeedless to say, you should never do this.<br/><br/>One of the dangers of taking investment from individual angels,\nrather than through an angel group or investment firm, is that they\nhave less reputation to protect.  A big-name VC firm will not screw\nyou too outrageously, because other founders would avoid them if\nword got out.  With individual angels you don't have this protection,\nas we found to our dismay in our own startup.  In many startups'\nlives there comes a point when you're at the investors' \nmercy—when you're out of money and the only place to get more is your\nexisting investors.  When we got into such a scrape, our investors\ntook advantage of it in a way that a name-brand VC probably wouldn't\nhave.<br/><br/>Angels have a corresponding advantage, however: they're also not\nbound by all the rules that VC firms are.  And so they can, for\nexample, allow founders to cash out partially in a funding round,\nby selling some of their stock directly to the investors.  I think\nthis will become more common; the average founder is eager to do\nit, and selling, say, half a million dollars worth of stock will\nnot, as VCs fear, cause most founders to be any less committed to\nthe business.<br/><br/>The same angels who tried to screw us also let us do this, and so\non balance I'm grateful rather than angry.  (As in families, relations\nbetween founders and investors can be complicated.)<br/><br/>The best way to find angel investors is through personal introductions.\nYou could try to cold-call angel groups near you, but angels, like\nVCs, will pay more attention to deals recommended by someone they\nrespect.<br/><br/>Deal terms with angels vary a lot.  There are no generally accepted\nstandards.  Sometimes angels' deal terms are as fearsome as VCs'.\nOther angels, particularly in the earliest stages, will invest based\non a two-page agreement.<br/><br/>Angels who only invest occasionally may not themselves know what\nterms they want.  They just want to invest in this startup.  What\nkind of anti-dilution protection do they want?  Hell if they know.\nIn these situations, the deal terms tend to be random: the angel\nasks his lawyer to create a vanilla agreement, and the terms end\nup being whatever the lawyer considers vanilla.  Which in practice\nusually means, whatever existing agreement he finds lying around\nhis firm.  (Few legal documents are created from scratch.)<br/><br/>These heaps o' boilerplate are a problem for small startups, because\nthey tend to grow into the union of all preceding documents.  I\nknow of one startup that got from an angel investor what amounted\nto a five hundred pound handshake: after deciding to invest, the\nangel presented them with a 70-page agreement.  The startup didn't\nhave enough money to pay a lawyer even to read it, let alone negotiate\nthe terms, so the deal fell through.<br/><br/>One solution to this problem would be to have the startup's lawyer\nproduce the agreement, instead of the angel's.  Some angels might\nbalk at this, but others would probably welcome it.<br/><br/>Inexperienced angels often get cold feet when the time comes to\nwrite that big check.  In our startup, one of the two angels in the\ninitial round took months to pay us, and only did after repeated\nnagging from our lawyer, who was also, fortunately, his lawyer.<br/><br/>It's obvious why investors delay.  Investing in startups is risky!\nWhen a company is only two months old, every <i>day</i> you wait\ngives you 1.7% more data about their trajectory.  But the investor\nis already being compensated for that risk in the low price of the\nstock, so it is unfair to delay.<br/><br/>Fair or not, investors do it if you let them.  Even VCs do it.  And\nfunding delays are a big distraction for founders, who ought to be\nworking on their company, not worrying about investors.  What's a\nstartup to do?  With both investors and acquirers, the only leverage\nyou have is competition.  If an investor knows you have other\ninvestors lined up, he'll be a lot more eager to close-- and not\njust because he'll worry about losing the deal, but because if other\ninvestors are interested, you must be worth investing in.  It's the\nsame with acquisitions.  No one wants to buy you till someone else\nwants to buy you, and then everyone wants to buy you.<br/><br/>The key to closing deals is never to stop pursuing alternatives.\nWhen an investor says he wants to invest in you, or an acquirer\nsays they want to buy you, <i>don't believe it till you get the\ncheck.</i>  Your natural tendency when an investor says yes will\nbe to relax and go back to writing code.  Alas, you can't; you have\nto keep looking for more investors, if only to get this one to act.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f4n\"><font color=\"#777777\">4</font></a>]</font><br/><br/><b>Seed Funding Firms</b><br/><br/>Seed firms are like angels in that they invest relatively small\namounts at early stages, but like VCs in that they're companies\nthat do it as a business, rather than individuals making occasional\ninvestments on the side.<br/><br/>Till now, nearly all seed firms have been so-called \"incubators,\"\nso <a href=\"http://ycombinator.com\">Y Combinator</a> gets called\none too, though the only thing we have in common is that we invest\nin the earliest phase.<br/><br/>According to the National Association of Business Incubators, there\nare about 800 incubators in the US.  This is an astounding number,\nbecause I know the founders of a lot of startups, and I can't think\nof one that began in an incubator.<br/><br/>What is an incubator?  I'm not sure myself.  The defining quality\nseems to be that you work in their space.  That's where the name\n\"incubator\" comes from.  They seem to vary a great deal in other\nrespects.  At one extreme is the sort of pork-barrel project where\na town gets money from the state government to renovate a vacant\nbuilding as a \"high-tech incubator,\" as if it were merely lack of\nthe right sort of office space that had till now prevented the town\nfrom becoming a \n<a href=\"siliconvalley.html\">startup hub</a>.  \nAt the other extreme are places like\nIdealab, which generates ideas for new startups internally and hires\npeople to work for them.<br/><br/>The classic Bubble incubators, most of which now seem to be dead,\nwere like VC firms except that they took a much bigger role in the\nstartups they funded.  In addition to working in their space, you\nwere supposed to use their office staff, lawyers, accountants, and\nso on.<br/><br/>Whereas incubators tend (or tended) to exert more control than VCs,\nY Combinator exerts less.  <!-- We just supply seed money, advice, and\nintroductions.  We don't want any control over the startups we fund. -->\nAnd we think it's better if startups operate out of their own\npremises, however crappy, than the offices of their investors.  So\nit's annoying that we keep getting called an \"incubator,\" but perhaps\ninevitable, because there's only one of us so far and no word yet\nfor what we are.  If we have to be called something, the obvious\nname would be \"excubator.\" (The name is more excusable if one\nconsiders it as meaning that we enable people to escape cubicles.)<br/><br/>Because seed firms are companies rather than individual people,\nreaching them is easier than reaching angels.  Just go to their web\nsite and send them an email.  The importance of personal introductions\nvaries, but is less than with angels or VCs.<br/><br/>The fact that seed firms are companies also means the investment\nprocess is more standardized.  (This is generally true with angel\ngroups too.) Seed firms will probably have set deal terms they use\nfor every startup they fund.  The fact that the deal terms are\nstandard doesn't mean they're favorable to you, but if other startups\nhave signed the same agreements and things went well for them, it's\na sign the terms are reasonable.<br/><br/>Seed firms differ from angels and VCs in that they invest exclusively\nin the earliest phases—often when the company is still just an\nidea.  Angels and even VC firms occasionally do this, but they also\ninvest at later stages.<br/><br/>The problems are different in the early stages.  For example, in\nthe first couple months a startup may completely redefine their <a href=\"ideas.html\">idea</a>.  So seed investors usually care less\nabout the idea than the people. This is true of all venture funding,\nbut especially so in the seed stage.<br/><br/>Like VCs, one of the advantages of seed firms is the advice they\noffer.  But because seed firms operate in an earlier phase, they\nneed to offer different kinds of advice.  For example, a seed firm\nshould be able to give advice about how to approach VCs, which VCs\nobviously don't need to do; whereas VCs should be able to give\nadvice about how to hire an \"executive team,\" which is not an issue\nin the seed stage.<br/><br/>In the earliest phases, a lot of the problems are technical, so\nseed firms should be able to help with technical as well as business\nproblems.<br/><br/>Seed firms and angel investors generally want to invest in the\ninitial phases of a startup, then hand them off to VC firms for the\nnext round.  Occasionally startups go from seed funding direct to\nacquisition, however, and I expect this to become increasingly\ncommon.<br/><br/>Google has been aggressively pursuing this route, and now <a href=\"http://ycombinator.com/buckman.html\">Yahoo</a> is too.  Both\nnow compete directly with VCs.  And this is a smart move.  Why wait\nfor further funding rounds to jack up a startup's price?  When a\nstartup reaches the point where VCs have enough information to\ninvest in it, the acquirer should have enough information to buy\nit.  More information, in fact; with their technical depth, the\nacquirers should be better at picking winners than VCs.<br/><br/><b>Venture Capital Funds</b><br/><br/>VC firms are like seed firms in that they're actual companies, but\nthey invest other people's money, and much larger amounts of it.\nVC investments average several million dollars.  So they tend to\ncome later in the life of a startup, are harder to get, and come\nwith tougher terms.<br/><br/>The word \"venture capitalist\" is sometimes used loosely for any\nventure investor, but there is a sharp difference between VCs and\nother investors: VC firms are organized as <i>funds</i>, much like\nhedge funds or mutual funds.  The fund managers, who are called\n\"general partners,\" get about 2% of the fund annually as a management\nfee, plus about 20% of the fund's gains.<br/><br/>There is a very sharp dropoff in performance among VC firms, because\nin the VC business both success and failure are self-perpetuating.\nWhen an investment scores spectacularly, as Google did for Kleiner\nand Sequoia, it generates a lot of good publicity for the VCs.  And\nmany founders prefer to take money from successful VC firms, because\nof the legitimacy it confers.  Hence a vicious (for the losers)\ncycle:  VC firms that have been doing badly will only get the deals\nthe bigger fish have rejected, causing them to continue to do badly.<br/><br/>As a result, of the thousand or so VC funds in the US now, only\nabout 50 are likely to make money, and it is very hard for a new\nfund to break into this group.<br/><br/>In a sense, the lower-tier VC firms are a bargain for founders.\nThey may not be quite as smart or as well connected as the big-name\nfirms, but they are much hungrier for deals.  This means you should\nbe able to get better terms from them.<br/><br/>Better how?  The most obvious is valuation: they'll take less of\nyour company.  But as well as money, there's power.  I think founders\nwill increasingly be able to stay on as CEO, and on terms that will\nmake it fairly hard to fire them later.<br/><br/>The most dramatic change, I predict,\nis that VCs will allow founders to \ncash out partially by <a href=\"vcsqueeze.html\">selling</a>\nsome of their stock direct to the VC firm.  VCs have traditionally\nresisted letting founders get anything before the ultimate \"liquidity\nevent.\"  But they're also desperate for deals.  And since I know\nfrom my own experience that the rule against buying stock from\nfounders is a stupid one, this is a natural place for things to\ngive as venture funding becomes more and more a seller's market.<br/><br/>The disadvantage of taking money from less known firms is that\npeople will assume, correctly or not, that you were turned down by\nthe more exalted ones.  But, like where you went to college, the\nname of your VC stops mattering once you have some performance to\nmeasure.  So the more confident you are, the less you need a\nbrand-name VC.  We funded Viaweb entirely with angel money; it never\noccurred to us that the backing of a well known VC firm would make\nus seem more impressive.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f5n\"><font color=\"#777777\">5</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Another danger of less known firms is that, like angels, they have\nless reputation to protect.   I suspect it's the lower-tier firms\nthat are responsible for most of the tricks that have given VCs\nsuch a bad reputation among hackers.  They are doubly hosed: the\ngeneral partners themselves are less able, and yet they have harder\nproblems to solve, because the top VCs skim off all the best deals,\nleaving the lower-tier firms exactly the startups that are likely\nto blow up.<br/><br/>For example, lower-tier firms are much more likely to pretend to\nwant to do a deal with you just to lock you up while they decide\nif they really want to.  One experienced CFO said:\n<blockquote>\n The better ones usually will not give a term sheet unless they\n really want to do a deal. The second or third tier firms have a\n much higher break rate—it could be as high as 50%.\n</blockquote>\nIt's obvious why: the lower-tier firms' biggest fear, when chance\nthrows them a bone, is that one of the big dogs will notice and\ntake it away.  The big dogs don't have to worry about that.<br/><br/>Falling victim to this trick could really hurt you.  As one\nVC told me:\n<blockquote>\n  If you were talking to four VCs, told three of them that you\n  accepted a term sheet, and then have to call them back to tell\n  them you were just kidding, you are absolutely damaged goods.\n</blockquote>\nHere's a partial solution: when a VC offers you a term sheet, ask\nhow many of their last 10 term sheets turned into deals.  This will\nat least force them to lie outright if they want to mislead you.<br/><br/>Not all the people who work at VC firms are partners.  Most firms\nalso have a handful of junior employees called something like\nassociates or analysts.  If you get a call from a VC\nfirm, go to their web site and check whether the person you talked\nto is a partner.  Odds are it will be a junior person; they scour\nthe web looking for startups their bosses could invest in.  The\njunior people will tend to seem very positive about your company.\nThey're not pretending; they <i>want</i> to believe you're a hot\nprospect, because it would be a huge coup for them if their firm\ninvested in a company they discovered.  Don't be misled by this\noptimism.  It's the partners who decide, and they view things with\na colder eye.<br/><br/>Because VCs invest large amounts, the money comes with more\nrestrictions.  Most only come into effect if the company gets into\ntrouble.  For example, VCs generally write it into the deal that\nin any sale, they get their investment back first.  So if the company\ngets sold at a low price, the founders could get nothing.  Some VCs\nnow require that in any sale they get 4x their investment back\nbefore the common stock holders (that is, you) get anything, but\nthis is an abuse that should be resisted.<br/><br/>Another difference with large investments is that the founders are\nusually required to accept \"vesting\"—to surrender their stock and\nearn it back over the next 4-5 years.  VCs don't want to invest\nmillions in a company the founders could just walk away from.\nFinancially, vesting has little effect, but in some situations it\ncould mean founders will have less power.  If VCs got de facto\ncontrol of the company and fired one of the founders, he'd lose any\nunvested stock unless there was specific protection against this.\nSo vesting would in that situation force founders to toe the line.<br/><br/>The most noticeable change when a startup takes serious funding is\nthat the founders will no longer have complete control.  Ten years\nago VCs used to insist that founders step down as CEO and hand the\njob over to a business guy they supplied.  This is less the rule\nnow, partly because the disasters of the Bubble showed that generic\nbusiness guys don't make such great CEOs.<br/><br/>But while founders will increasingly be able to stay on as CEO,\nthey'll have to cede some power, because the board of directors\nwill become more powerful.  In the seed stage, the board is generally\na formality; if you want to talk to the other board members, you\njust yell into the next room.  This stops with VC-scale money.  In\na typical VC funding deal, the board of directors might be composed\nof two VCs, two founders, and one outside person acceptable to both.\nThe board will have ultimate power, which means the founders now\nhave to convince instead of commanding.<br/><br/>This is not as bad as it sounds, however.  Bill Gates is in the\nsame position; he doesn't have majority control of Microsoft; in\nprinciple he also has to convince instead of commanding.  And yet\nhe seems pretty commanding, doesn't he?  As long as things are going\nsmoothly, boards don't interfere much.  The danger comes when there's\na bump in the road, as happened to Steve Jobs at Apple.<br/><br/>Like angels, VCs prefer to invest in deals that come to them through\npeople they know.  So while nearly all VC funds have some address\nyou can send your business plan to, VCs privately admit the chance\nof getting funding by this route is near zero.  One recently told\nme that he did not know a single startup that got funded this way.<br/><br/>I suspect VCs accept business plans \"over the transom\" more as a\nway to keep tabs on industry trends than as a source of deals.  In\nfact, I would strongly advise against mailing your business plan\nrandomly to VCs, because they treat this as evidence of laziness.\nDo the extra work of getting personal introductions.  As one VC put\nit:\n<blockquote>\n  I'm not hard to find.  I know a lot of people.  If you can't find\n  some way to reach me, how are you going to create a successful\n  company?\n</blockquote>\nOne of the most difficult problems for startup founders is deciding\nwhen to approach VCs. You really only get one chance, because they\nrely heavily on first impressions.  And you can't approach some and\nsave others for later, because (a) they ask who else you've talked\nto and when and (b) they talk among themselves.  If you're talking\nto one VC and he finds out that you were rejected by another several\nmonths ago, you'll definitely seem shopworn.<br/><br/>So when do you approach VCs?  When you can convince them.  If the\nfounders have impressive resumes and the idea isn't hard to understand,\nyou could approach VCs quite early.  Whereas if the founders are\nunknown and the idea is very novel, you might have to launch the\nthing and show that users loved it before VCs would be convinced.<br/><br/>If several VCs are interested in you, they will sometimes be willing\nto split the deal between them.  They're more likely to do this if\nthey're close in the VC pecking order.  Such deals may be a net win\nfor founders, because you get multiple VCs interested in your\nsuccess, and you can ask each for advice about the other.  One\nfounder I know wrote:\n<blockquote>\n  Two-firm deals are great. It costs you a little more equity, but\n  being able to play the two firms off each other (as well as ask\n  one if the other is being out of line) is invaluable.\n</blockquote>\nWhen you do negotiate with VCs, remember that they've done this a\nlot more than you have.  They've invested in dozens of startups,\nwhereas this is probably the first you've founded.  But don't let\nthem or the situation intimidate you. The average founder is smarter\nthan the average VC.  So just do what you'd do in any complex,\nunfamiliar situation: proceed deliberately, and question anything\nthat seems odd.<br/><br/>It is, unfortunately, common for VCs to put terms in an agreement\nwhose consequences surprise founders later, and also common for VCs\nto defend things they do by saying that they're standard in the\nindustry.  Standard, schmandard; the whole industry is only a few\ndecades old, and rapidly evolving.  The concept of \"standard\" is a\nuseful one when you're operating on a small scale (Y Combinator\nuses identical terms for every deal because for tiny seed-stage\ninvestments it's not worth the overhead of negotiating individual\ndeals), but it doesn't apply at the VC level.  On that scale, every\nnegotiation is unique.<br/><br/>Most successful startups get money from more than one of the preceding\nfive sources. \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f6n\"><font color=\"#777777\">6</font></a>]</font>\nAnd, confusingly, the names of funding sources\nalso tend to be used as the names of different rounds.  The best\nway to explain how it all works is to follow the case of a hypothetical\nstartup.<br/><br/><b>Stage 1: Seed Round</b><br/><br/>Our startup begins when a group of three friends have an idea--\neither an idea for something they might build, or simply the idea\n\"let's start a company.\"  Presumably they already have some source\nof food and shelter.  But if you have food and shelter, you probably\nalso have something you're supposed to be working on: either\nclasswork, or a job.  So if you want to work full-time on a startup,\nyour money situation will probably change too.<br/><br/>A lot of startup founders say they started the company without any\nidea of what they planned to do.  This is actually less common than\nit seems: many have to claim they thought of the idea after quitting\nbecause otherwise their former employer would own it.<br/><br/>The three friends decide to take the leap.  Since most startups are\nin competitive businesses, you not only want to work full-time on\nthem, but more than full-time.  So some or all of the friends quit\ntheir jobs or leave school.  (Some of the founders in a startup can\nstay in grad school, but at least one has to make the company his\nfull-time job.)<br/><br/>They're going to run the company out of one of their apartments at\nfirst, and since they don't have any users they don't have to pay\nmuch for infrastructure.  Their main expenses are setting up the\ncompany, which costs a couple thousand dollars in legal work and\nregistration fees, and the living expenses of the founders.<br/><br/>The phrase \"seed investment\" covers a broad range.  To some VC firms\nit means $500,000, but to most startups it means several months'\nliving expenses.  We'll suppose our group of friends start with\n$15,000 from their friend's rich uncle, who they give 5% of the\ncompany in return.  There's only common stock at this stage.  They\nleave 20% as an options pool for later employees (but they set\nthings up so that they can issue this stock to themselves if they\nget bought early and most is still unissued), and the three founders\neach get 25%.<br/><br/>By living really cheaply they think they can make the remaining\nmoney last five months.  When you have five months' runway left,\nhow soon do you need to start looking for your next round?  Answer:\nimmediately.  It takes time to find investors, and time (always\nmore than you expect) for the deal to close even after they say\nyes.  So if our group of founders know what they're doing they'll\nstart sniffing around for angel investors right away.  But of course\ntheir main job is to build version 1 of their software.<br/><br/>The friends might have liked to have more money in this first phase,\nbut being slightly underfunded teaches them an important lesson.\nFor a startup, cheapness is power.  The lower your costs, the more\noptions you have—not just at this stage, but at every point till\nyou're profitable.  When you have a high \"burn rate,\" you're always\nunder time pressure, which means (a) you don't have time for your\nideas to evolve, and (b) you're often forced to take deals you don't\nlike.<br/><br/>Every startup's rule should be: spend little, and work fast.<br/><br/>After ten weeks' work the three friends have built a prototype that\ngives one a taste of what their product will do.  It's not what\nthey originally set out to do—in the process of writing it, they\nhad some new ideas.  And it only does a fraction of what the finished\nproduct will do, but that fraction includes stuff that no one else\nhas done before.<br/><br/>They've also written at least a skeleton business plan, addressing\nthe five fundamental questions: what they're going to do, why users\nneed it, how large the market is, how they'll make money, and who\nthe competitors are and why this company is going to beat them.\n(That last has to be more specific than \"they suck\" or \"we'll work\nreally hard.\")<br/><br/>If you have to choose between spending time on the demo or the\nbusiness plan, spend most on the demo.   Software is not only more\nconvincing, but a better way to explore ideas.<br/><br/><b>Stage 2: Angel Round</b><br/><br/>While writing the prototype, the group has been traversing their\nnetwork of friends in search of angel investors.  They find some\njust as the prototype is demoable.  When they demo it, one of the\nangels is willing to invest.  Now the group is looking for more\nmoney: they want enough to last for a year, and maybe to hire a\ncouple friends.  So they're going to raise $200,000.<br/><br/>The angel agrees to invest at a pre-money valuation of $1 million.\nThe company issues $200,000 worth of new shares to the angel; if\nthere were 1000 shares before the deal, this means 200 additional\nshares.  The angel now owns 200/1200 shares, or a sixth of the\ncompany, and all the previous shareholders' percentage ownership\nis diluted by a sixth.  After the deal, the capitalization table\nlooks like this:\n<xmp>\nshareholder   shares    percent\n-------------------------------\nangel           200       16.7\nuncle            50        4.2\neach founder    250       20.8\noption pool     200       16.7\n               ----      -----\ntotal          1200      100\n</xmp>\nTo keep things simple, I had the angel do a straight cash for stock\ndeal.  In reality the angel might be more likely to make the\ninvestment in the form of a convertible loan.  A convertible loan\nis a loan that can be converted into stock later; it works out the\nsame as a stock purchase in the end, but gives the angel more\nprotection against being squashed by VCs in future rounds.<br/><br/>Who pays the legal bills for this deal?  The startup, remember,\nonly has a couple thousand left.  In practice this turns out to be\na sticky problem that usually gets solved in some improvised way.\nMaybe the startup can find lawyers who will do it cheaply in the\nhope of future work if the startup succeeds.  Maybe someone has a\nlawyer friend.  Maybe the angel pays for his lawyer to represent\nboth sides.  (Make sure if you take the latter route that the lawyer\nis <i>representing</i> you rather than merely advising you, or his\nonly duty is to the investor.)<br/><br/>An angel investing $200k would probably expect a seat on the board\nof directors.  He might also want preferred stock, meaning a special\nclass of stock that has some additional rights over the common stock\neveryone else has.  Typically these rights include vetoes over major\nstrategic decisions, protection against being diluted in future\nrounds, and the right to get one's investment back first if the\ncompany is sold.<br/><br/>Some investors might expect the founders to accept vesting for a\nsum this size, and others wouldn't.  VCs are more likely to require\nvesting than angels.  At Viaweb we managed to raise $2.5 million\nfrom angels without ever accepting vesting, largely because we were\nso inexperienced that we were appalled at the idea.  In practice\nthis turned out to be good, because it made us harder to push around.<br/><br/>Our experience was unusual; vesting is the norm for amounts that\nsize.  Y Combinator doesn't require vesting, because (a) we invest\nsuch small amounts, and (b) we think it's unnecessary, and that the\nhope of getting rich is enough motivation to keep founders at work.\nBut maybe if we were investing millions we would think differently.<br/><br/>I should add that vesting is also a way for founders to protect\nthemselves against one another.  It solves the problem of what to\ndo if one of the founders quits.  So some founders impose it on\nthemselves when they start the company.<br/><br/>The angel deal takes two weeks to close, so we are now three months\ninto the life of the company.<br/><br/>The point after you get the first big chunk of angel money will\nusually be the happiest phase in a startup's life.  It's a lot like\nbeing a postdoc: you have no immediate financial worries, and few\nresponsibilities.  You get to work on juicy kinds of work, like\ndesigning software.  You don't have to spend time on bureaucratic\nstuff, because you haven't hired any bureaucrats yet.  Enjoy it\nwhile it lasts, and get as much done as you can, because you will\nnever again be so productive.<br/><br/>With an apparently inexhaustible sum of money sitting safely in the\nbank, the founders happily set to work turning their prototype into\nsomething they can release.  They hire one of their friends—at\nfirst just as a consultant, so they can try him out—and then a\nmonth later as employee #1. They pay him the smallest salary he can\nlive on, plus 3% of the company in restricted stock, vesting over\nfour years.  (So after this the option pool is down to 13.7%).  \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f7n\"><font color=\"#777777\">7</font></a>]</font>\nThey also spend a little money on a freelance graphic designer.<br/><br/>How much stock do you give early employees?  That varies so much\nthat there's no conventional number.  If you get someone really\ngood, really early, it might be wise to give him as much stock as\nthe founders.  The one universal rule is that the amount of stock\nan employee gets decreases polynomially with the age of the company.\nIn other words, you get rich as a power of how early you were.  So\nif some friends want you to come work for their startup, don't wait\nseveral months before deciding.<br/><br/>A month later, at the end of month four, our group of founders have\nsomething they can launch.  Gradually through word of mouth they\nstart to get users.  Seeing the system in use by real users—people\nthey don't know—gives them lots of new ideas.  Also they find\nthey now worry obsessively about the status of their server.  (How\nrelaxing founders' lives must have been when startups wrote VisiCalc.)<br/><br/>By the end of month six, the system is starting to have a solid\ncore of features, and a small but devoted following.  People start\nto write about it, and the founders are starting to feel like experts\nin their field.<br/><br/>We'll assume that their startup is one that could put millions more\nto use.  Perhaps they need to spend a lot on marketing, or build\nsome kind of expensive infrastructure, or hire highly paid salesmen.\nSo they decide to start talking to VCs.  They get introductions to\nVCs from various sources: their angel investor connects them with\na couple; they meet a few at conferences; a couple VCs call them\nafter reading about them.<br/><br/><b>Step 3: Series A Round</b><br/><br/>Armed with their now somewhat fleshed-out business plan and able\nto demo a real, working system, the founders visit the VCs they\nhave introductions to.  They find the VCs intimidating and inscrutable.\nThey all ask the same question: who else have you pitched to?  (VCs\nare like high school girls: they're acutely aware of their position\nin the VC pecking order, and their interest in a company is a\nfunction of the interest other VCs show in it.)<br/><br/>One of the VC firms says they want to invest and offers the founders\na term sheet.  A term sheet is a summary of what the deal terms\nwill be when and if they do a deal; lawyers will fill in the details\nlater.  By accepting the term sheet, the startup agrees to turn\naway other VCs for some set amount of time while this firm does the\n\"due diligence\" required for the deal.  Due diligence is the corporate\nequivalent of a background check: the purpose is to uncover any\nhidden bombs that might sink the company later, like serious design\nflaws in the product, pending lawsuits against the company,\nintellectual property issues, and so on.  VCs' legal and financial\ndue diligence is pretty thorough, but the technical due diligence\nis generally a joke.  \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f8n\"><font color=\"#777777\">8</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The due diligence discloses no ticking bombs, and six weeks later\nthey go ahead with the deal.  Here are the terms: a $2 million\ninvestment at a pre-money valuation of $4 million, meaning that\nafter the deal closes the VCs will own a third of the company (2 /\n(4 + 2)).  The VCs also insist that prior to the deal the option\npool be enlarged by an additional hundred shares.  So the total\nnumber of new shares issued is 750, and the cap table becomes:\n<xmp>\nshareholder   shares    percent\n-------------------------------\nVCs             650       33.3\nangel           200       10.3\nuncle            50        2.6\neach founder    250       12.8\nemployee         36*       1.8     *unvested\noption pool     264       13.5\n               ----      -----\ntotal          1950      100\n</xmp>\nThis picture is unrealistic in several respects.  For example, while\nthe percentages might end up looking like this, it's unlikely that\nthe VCs would keep the existing numbers of shares.  In fact, every\nbit of the startup's paperwork would probably be replaced, as if\nthe company were being founded anew.  Also, the money might come\nin several tranches, the later ones subject to various \nconditions—though this is apparently more common in deals with lower-tier VCs\n(whose lot in life is to fund more dubious startups) than with the\ntop firms.<br/><br/>And of course any VCs reading this are probably rolling on the floor\nlaughing at how my hypothetical VCs let the angel keep his 10.3 of\nthe company.  I admit, this is the Bambi version; in simplifying\nthe picture, I've also made everyone nicer.  In the real world, VCs\nregard angels the way a jealous husband feels about his wife's\nprevious boyfriends.  To them the company didn't exist before they\ninvested in it.  \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f9n\"><font color=\"#777777\">9</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>I don't want to give the impression you have to do an angel round\nbefore going to VCs.  In this example I stretched things out to\nshow multiple sources of funding in action. Some startups could go\ndirectly from seed funding to a VC round; several of the companies\nwe've funded have.<br/><br/>The founders are required to vest their shares over four years, and\nthe board is now reconstituted to consist of two VCs, two founders,\nand a fifth person acceptable to both. The angel investor cheerfully\nsurrenders his board seat.<br/><br/>At this point there is nothing new our startup can teach us about\nfunding—or at least, nothing good.   \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f10n\"><font color=\"#777777\">10</font></a>]</font>\nThe startup will almost\ncertainly hire more people at this point; those millions must be\nput to work, after all.  The company may do additional funding\nrounds, presumably at higher valuations.  They may if they are\nextraordinarily fortunate do an IPO, which we should remember is\nalso in principle a round of funding, regardless of its de facto\npurpose.  But that, if not beyond the bounds of possibility, is\nbeyond the scope of this article.<br/><br/><b>Deals Fall Through</b><br/><br/>Anyone who's been through a startup will find the preceding portrait\nto be missing something: disasters.  If there's one thing all\nstartups have in common, it's that something is always going wrong.\nAnd nowhere more than in matters of funding.<br/><br/>For example, our hypothetical startup never spent more than half\nof one round before securing the next.  That's more ideal than\ntypical.  Many startups—even successful ones—come close to\nrunning out of money at some point.  Terrible things happen to\nstartups when they run out of money, because they're designed for\ngrowth, not adversity.<br/><br/>But the most unrealistic thing about the series of deals I've\ndescribed is that they all closed.  In the startup world, closing\nis not what deals do.  What deals do is fall through.  If you're\nstarting a startup you would do well to remember that.  Birds fly;\nfish swim; deals fall through.<br/><br/>Why?  Partly the reason deals seem to fall through so often is that\nyou lie to yourself.  You want the deal to close, so you start to\nbelieve it will.  But even correcting for this, startup deals fall\nthrough alarmingly often—far more often than, say, deals to buy\nreal estate.  The reason is that it's such a risky environment.\nPeople about to fund or acquire a startup are prone to wicked cases\nof buyer's remorse.  They don't really grasp the risk they're taking\ntill the deal's about to close.  And then they panic.  And not just\ninexperienced angel investors, but big companies too.<br/><br/>So if you're a startup founder wondering why some angel investor\nisn't returning your phone calls, you can at least take comfort in\nthe thought that the same thing is happening to other deals a hundred\ntimes the size.<br/><br/>The example of a startup's history that I've presented is like a\nskeleton—accurate so far as it goes, but needing to be fleshed\nout to be a complete picture.  To get a complete picture, just add\nin every possible disaster.<br/><br/>A frightening prospect?  In a way.  And yet also in a way encouraging.\nThe very uncertainty of startups frightens away almost everyone.\nPeople overvalue stability—especially <a href=\"hiring.html\">young</a>\npeople, who ironically need it least.  And so in starting a startup,\nas in any really bold undertaking, merely deciding to do it gets\nyou halfway there.  On the day of the race, most of the other runners\nwon't show up.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><xa href=\"http://reddit.com/vote?url=http://www.paulgraham.com/startupfunding.html\"><ximg border=\"0\" height=\"42\" src=\"http://reddit.com/static/voteme.png\" width=\"32\">\n<b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nThe aim of such regulations is to protect widows and orphans\nfrom crooked investment schemes; people with a million dollars in\nliquid assets are assumed to be able to protect themselves.\nThe unintended consequence is that the investments that generate\nthe highest returns, like hedge funds, are available only to the\nrich.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nConsulting is where product companies go to die.  IBM is the\nmost famous example.

And they are like sheep,\nbut that's a rational response to their situation.  Sheep act the\nway they do for a reason.  If all the other sheep head for a certain\nfield, it's probably good grazing.  And when a wolf appears, is he\ngoing to eat a sheep in the middle of the flock, or one near the\nedge?<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f5n\"><font color=\"#000000\">5</font></a>]\nThis was partly confidence, and partly simple ignorance.  We\ndidn't know ourselves which VC firms were the impressive ones.  We\nthought software was all that mattered.  But that turned out to be\nthe right direction to be naive in: it's much better to overestimate\nthan underestimate the importance of making a good product.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f6n\"><font color=\"#000000\">6</font></a>]\nI've omitted one source: government grants.  I don't think\nthese are even worth thinking about for the average startup.\nGovernments may mean well when they set up grant programs to encourage\nstartups, but what they give with one hand they take away with the\nother: the process of applying is inevitably so arduous, and the\nrestrictions on what you can do with the money so burdensome, that\nit would be easier to take a job to get the money.<br/><br/><!-- Here's an excerpt from an email I got from a German startup\nfounder:\n<blockquote>\nI recently got 50k EUR government funding for technological innovation (basically to buy software, computers and so on). I can't hire people \non that money (except pay myself absolute minimum wage) and the money \nis spread over 18 months and arrives with a delay of 6 months. I can't \nspend money on my accountant, or any non-technology costs (can't buy \nchairs either). To solve my money problems and try to set my mind at \nease, I have been thinking to do consultancy work for other people.\n</blockquote> -->\nYou should be especially suspicious of grants whose purpose is some\nkind of social engineering-- e.g. to encourage more startups to be\nstarted in Mississippi.  Free money to start a startup in a place\nwhere few succeed is hardly free.<br/><br/>Some government agencies run venture funding groups, which make\ninvestments rather than giving grants.  For example, the CIA runs\na venture fund called In-Q-Tel that is modelled on private sector\nfunds and apparently generates good returns.  They would probably\nbe worth approaching—if you don't mind taking money from the CIA.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f7n\"><font color=\"#000000\">7</font></a>]\nOptions have largely been replaced with restricted stock, which\namounts to the same thing.  Instead of earning the right to buy\nstock, the employee gets the stock up front, and earns the right\nnot to have to give it back.  The shares set aside for this purpose\nare still called the \"option pool.\"<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f8n\"><font color=\"#000000\">8</font></a>]\nFirst-rate technical people do not generally hire themselves\nout to do due diligence for VCs.  So the most difficult\npart for startup founders is often responding politely to the inane\nquestions of the \"expert\" they send to look you over.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f9n\"><font color=\"#000000\">9</font></a>]\nVCs regularly wipe out angels by issuing arbitrary amounts of\nnew stock.  They seem to have a standard piece of casuistry for\nthis situation: that the angels are no longer working to help the\ncompany, and so don't deserve to keep their stock.  This of course\nreflects a willful misunderstanding of what investment means; like\nany investor, the angel is being compensated for risks he took\nearlier.  By a similar logic, one could argue that the VCs should\nbe deprived of their shares when the company goes public.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f10n\"><font color=\"#000000\">10</font></a>]\nOne new thing the company might encounter is a <i>down\nround</i>, or a funding round at valuation lower than the previous\nround.  Down rounds are bad news; it is generally the common stock\nholders who take the hit.  Some of the most fearsome provisions in\nVC deal terms have to do with down rounds—like \"full ratchet\nanti-dilution,\" which is as frightening as it sounds.<br/><br/>Founders are tempted to ignore these clauses, because they think\nthe company will either be a big success or a complete bust.  VCs\nknow otherwise: it's not uncommon for startups to have moments of\nadversity before they ultimately succeed.  So it's worth negotiating\nanti-dilution provisions, even though you don't think you need to,\nand VCs will try to make you feel that you're being gratuitously\ntroublesome.<br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Hutch Fishman, Steve Huffman, Jessica\nLivingston, Sesha Pratap, Stan Reiss, Andy Singleton, Zak Stone,\nand Aaron Swartz for reading drafts of this.<br/><br/></ximg></xa></br></p></font>","date":"2005-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
