{"href":"opensource.html","title":"What Business Can Learn from Open Source","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">August 2005<br/><br/><i>(This essay is derived from a talk at Oscon 2005.)</i><br/><br/>Lately companies have been paying more attention to open source.\nTen years ago there seemed a real danger Microsoft would extend its\nmonopoly to servers.  It seems safe to say now that open source has\nprevented that.  A recent survey found 52% of companies are replacing\nWindows servers with Linux servers.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/opensource.html#f1n\"><font color=\"#777777\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>More significant, I think, is <i>which</i> 52% they are.  At this point,\nanyone proposing to run Windows on servers should be prepared to\nexplain what they know about servers that Google, Yahoo, and Amazon\ndon't.<br/><br/>But the biggest thing business has to learn from open source is not\nabout Linux or Firefox, but about the forces that produced them.\nUltimately these will affect a lot more than what software you use.<br/><br/>We may be able to get a fix on these underlying forces by triangulating\nfrom open source and blogging.  As you've probably noticed, they\nhave a lot in common.<br/><br/>Like open source, blogging is something people do themselves, for\nfree, because they enjoy it.  Like open source hackers, bloggers\ncompete with people working for money, and often win.  The method\nof ensuring quality is also the same: Darwinian.  Companies ensure\nquality through rules to prevent employees from screwing up.  But\nyou don't need that when the audience can communicate with one\nanother.  People just produce whatever they want; the good stuff\nspreads, and the bad gets ignored.  And in both cases, feedback\nfrom the audience improves the best work.<br/><br/>Another thing blogging and open source have in common is the Web.\nPeople have always been willing to do great work\nfor free,  but before the Web it was harder to reach an audience\nor collaborate on projects.<br/><br/><b>Amateurs</b><br/><br/>I think the most important of the new principles business has to learn is\nthat people work a lot harder on stuff they like.  Well, that's\nnews to no one.  So how can I claim business has to learn it?  When\nI say business doesn't know this, I mean the structure of business\ndoesn't reflect it.<br/><br/>Business still reflects an older model, exemplified by the French\nword for working: <i>travailler</i>.  It has an English cousin, travail,\nand what it means is torture.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/opensource.html#f2n\"><font color=\"#777777\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>This turns out not to be the last word on work, however.\nAs societies get richer, they learn something about\nwork that's a lot like what they learn about diet.  We know now that the\nhealthiest diet is the one our peasant ancestors were forced to\neat because they were poor.  Like rich food, idleness\nonly seems desirable when you don't get enough of it.  I think we were\ndesigned to work, just as we were designed to eat a certain amount\nof fiber, and we feel bad if we don't.<br/><br/>There's a name for people who work for the love of it: amateurs.\nThe word now has such bad connotations that we forget its etymology,\nthough it's staring us in the face.  \"Amateur\" was originally rather\na complimentary word.  But the thing to be in the twentieth century\nwas professional, which amateurs, by definition, are not.<br/><br/>That's why the business world was so surprised by one lesson from\nopen source: that people working for love often surpass those working\nfor money.   Users don't switch from Explorer to Firefox because\nthey want to hack the source.  They switch because it's a better\nbrowser.<br/><br/>It's not that Microsoft isn't trying.  They know controlling the\nbrowser is one of the keys to retaining their monopoly.  The problem\nis the same they face in operating systems: they can't pay people\nenough to build something better than a group of inspired hackers\nwill build for free.<br/><br/>I suspect professionalism was always overrated-- not just in the\nliteral sense of working for money, but also connotations like\nformality and detachment.  Inconceivable as it would have seemed\nin, say, 1970, I think professionalism was largely a fashion,\ndriven by conditions that happened to exist in the twentieth century.<br/><br/>One of the most powerful of those was the existence of \"channels.\" Revealingly,\nthe same term was used for both products and information:  there\nwere distribution channels, and TV and radio channels.<br/><br/>It was the narrowness of such channels that made professionals\nseem so superior to amateurs.  There were only a few jobs as\nprofessional journalists, for example, so competition ensured the\naverage journalist was fairly good.  Whereas anyone can express\nopinions about current events in a bar.  And so the average person\nexpressing his opinions in a bar sounds like an idiot compared to\na journalist writing about the subject.<br/><br/>On the Web, the barrier for publishing your ideas is even lower.\nYou don't have to buy a drink, and they even let kids in.\nMillions of people are publishing online, and the average\nlevel of what they're writing, as you might expect, is not very\ngood.  This has led some in the media to conclude that blogs don't\npresent much of a threat-- that blogs are just a fad.<br/><br/>Actually, the fad is the word \"blog,\"  at least the way the print\nmedia now use it.  What they mean by \"blogger\" is not someone who\npublishes in a weblog format, but anyone who publishes online.\nThat's going to become a problem as the Web becomes the default\nmedium for publication.  So I'd\nlike to suggest an alternative word for someone who publishes online.\nHow about \"writer?\"<br/><br/>Those in the print media who dismiss the writing online because of\nits low average quality are missing an important point: no one reads\nthe <i>average</i> blog.  In the old world of channels, it meant something\nto talk about average quality, because that's what you were getting\nwhether you liked it or not.\nBut now you can read any writer you want.  So the average\nquality of writing online isn't what the print media are competing\nagainst.  They're competing against the best writing online.  And, \nlike Microsoft, they're losing.<br/><br/>I know that from my own experience as a reader.  Though most print\npublications are online, I probably\nread two or three articles on individual people's sites for every\none I read on the site of a newspaper or magazine.<br/><br/>And when I read, say, New York Times stories, I never reach\nthem through the Times front page.   Most I find through aggregators\nlike Google News or Slashdot or Delicious. Aggregators show how\nmuch <a href=\"http://reddit.com\">better</a> \nyou can do than the channel.  The New York Times front page is\na list of articles written by people who work for the New York Times.  Delicious\nis a list of articles that are interesting.  And it's only now that\nyou can see the two side by side that you notice how little overlap there is.<br/><br/>Most articles in the print media are boring.  For example, the\npresident notices that a majority of voters now think invading Iraq\nwas a mistake, so he makes an address to the nation to drum up\nsupport.  Where is the man bites dog in that?  I didn't hear the\nspeech, but I could probably tell you exactly what he said.  A\nspeech like that is, in the most literal sense, not news: there is\nnothing <i>new</i> in it.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/opensource.html#f3n\"><font color=\"#777777\">3</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Nor is there anything new, except the names and places, in most\n\"news\" about things going wrong.  A child is abducted; there's a\ntornado; a ferry sinks; someone gets bitten by a shark; a small\nplane crashes.  And what do you learn about the world from these\nstories?  Absolutely nothing.  They're outlying data points; what\nmakes them gripping also makes them irrelevant.<br/><br/>As in software, when professionals produce such crap, it's not\nsurprising if amateurs can do better.  Live by the channel, die by\nthe channel: if you depend on an oligopoly, you sink into bad habits\nthat are hard to overcome when you suddenly get competition.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/opensource.html#f4n\"><font color=\"#777777\">4</font></a>]</font><br/><br/><b>Workplaces</b><br/><br/>Another thing blogs and open source software have in common is that\nthey're often made by people working at home.  That may not seem\nsurprising.  But it should be.  It's the architectural equivalent\nof a home-made aircraft shooting down an F-18.  Companies spend\nmillions to build office buildings for a single purpose: to be a\nplace to work.  And yet people working in their own homes,\nwhich aren't even designed to be workplaces, end up\nbeing more productive.<br/><br/>This proves something a lot of us have suspected.  The average\noffice is a miserable place to get work done.  And a lot of what\nmakes offices bad are the very qualities we associate with\nprofessionalism.  The sterility\nof offices is supposed to suggest efficiency.  But suggesting\nefficiency is a different thing from actually being efficient.<br/><br/>The atmosphere of the average workplace is to productivity what\nflames painted on the side of a car are to speed.  And it's not\njust the way offices look that's bleak.  The way people act is just\nas bad.<br/><br/>Things are different in a startup.  Often as not a startup begins\nin an apartment.  Instead of matching beige cubicles\nthey have an assortment of furniture they bought used.  They work\nodd hours, wearing the most casual of clothing.  They look at\nwhatever they want online without worrying whether it's \"work safe.\"\nThe cheery, bland language of the office is replaced by wicked humor.  And\nyou know what?  The company at this stage is probably the most\nproductive it's ever going to be.<br/><br/>Maybe it's not a coincidence.  Maybe some aspects of professionalism\nare actually a net lose.<br/><br/>To me the most demoralizing aspect of the traditional office is\nthat you're supposed to be there at certain times.  There are usually\na few people in a company who really have to, but the reason most\nemployees work fixed hours is that the company can't measure their\nproductivity.<br/><br/>The basic idea behind office hours is that if you can't make people\nwork, you can at least prevent them from having fun.  If employees\nhave to be in the building a certain number of hours a day, and are\nforbidden to do non-work things while there, then they must be\nworking.  In theory.  In practice they spend a lot of their time\nin a no-man's land, where they're neither working nor having fun.<br/><br/>If you could measure how much work people did, many companies\nwouldn't need any fixed workday. You could just say: this is what\nyou have to do.  Do it whenever you like, wherever you like.  If\nyour work requires you to talk to other people in the company, then\nyou may need to be here a certain amount.  Otherwise we don't care.<br/><br/>That may seem utopian, but it's what we told people who came to\nwork for our company.  There were no fixed office hours.  I never\nshowed up before 11 in the morning.  But we weren't saying this to\nbe benevolent.  We were saying: if you work here we expect you to\nget a lot done.  Don't try to fool us just by being here a lot.<br/><br/>The problem with the facetime model is not just that it's demoralizing, but\nthat the people pretending to work interrupt\nthe ones actually working.  I'm convinced the facetime model\nis the main reason large organizations have so many meetings.\nPer capita, large organizations accomplish very little.\nAnd yet all those people have to be on site at least eight hours a\nday.  When so much time goes in one end and so little achievement\ncomes out the other, something has to give.  And meetings are the\nmain mechanism for taking up the slack.<br/><br/>For one year I worked at a regular nine to five job, and I remember\nwell the strange, cozy feeling that comes over one during meetings.\nI was very aware, because of the novelty, that I was being paid for\nprogramming.  It seemed just amazing, as if there was a machine on\nmy desk that spat out a dollar bill every two minutes no matter\nwhat I did.  Even while I was in the bathroom!  But because the\nimaginary machine was always running, I felt I always ought to be\nworking. And so meetings felt wonderfully relaxing.  They\ncounted as work, just like programming, but they were so much easier.\nAll you had to do was sit and look attentive.<br/><br/>Meetings are like an opiate with a network effect.  So is email,\non a smaller scale.  And in addition to the direct cost in time,\nthere's the cost in fragmentation-- breaking people's day up into\nbits too small to be useful.<br/><br/>You can see how dependent you've become on something by removing\nit suddenly.  So for big companies I propose the following experiment.\nSet aside one day where meetings are forbidden-- where everyone has to\nsit at their desk all day and work without interruption on\nthings they can do without talking to anyone else.\nSome amount of communication is necessary in most jobs, but I'm\nsure many employees could find eight hours worth of stuff they could\ndo by themselves.  You could call it \"Work Day.\"<br/><br/>The other problem with pretend work\nis that it often looks better than real work.  When I'm\nwriting or hacking I spend as much time just thinking as I do\nactually typing.  Half the time I'm sitting drinking a cup of tea,\nor walking around the neighborhood.  This is a critical phase--\nthis is where ideas come from-- and yet I'd feel guilty doing this\nin most offices, with everyone else looking busy.<br/><br/>It's hard to see how bad some practice is till you have something\nto compare it to.  And that's one reason open source, and even blogging\nin some cases, are so important.  They show us what real work looks like.<br/><br/>We're funding eight new startups at the moment.  A friend asked\nwhat they were doing for office space, and seemed surprised when I\nsaid we expected them to work out of whatever apartments they found\nto live in.  But we didn't propose that to save money.  We did it\nbecause we want their software to be good.  Working in crappy\ninformal spaces is one of the things startups do right without\nrealizing it.  As soon as you get into an office, work and life\nstart to drift apart.<br/><br/>That is one of the key tenets of professionalism. Work and life\nare supposed to be separate.  But that part, I'm convinced, is a \nmistake.<br/><br/><b>Bottom-Up</b><br/><br/>The third big lesson we can learn from open source and\nblogging is that ideas can bubble up from the bottom, instead of\nflowing down from the top.  Open source and blogging both work\nbottom-up: people make what they want, and the best stuff\nprevails.<br/><br/>Does this sound familiar?  It's the principle of a market economy.\nIronically, though open source and blogs are done for free, those\nworlds resemble market economies, while most companies, for all\ntheir talk about the value of free markets, are run internally like\ncommunist states.<br/><br/>There are two forces that together steer design: ideas about\nwhat to do next, and the enforcement of quality.  In the channel\nera, both flowed down from the top.  For example, newspaper editors\nassigned stories to reporters, then edited what they wrote.<br/><br/>Open source and blogging show us things don't have to work that\nway.  Ideas and even the enforcement of quality can flow bottom-up.\nAnd in both cases the results are not merely acceptable, but better.\nFor example, open source software is more reliable precisely because\nit's open source; anyone can find mistakes.<br/><br/>The same happens with writing.  As we got close to publication, I\nfound I was very worried about the essays in \n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0596006624\">Hackers\n&amp; Painters</a>\nthat hadn't been online.  Once an essay has had a couple thousand\npage views I feel reasonably confident about it.  But these had had \nliterally orders of magnitude less scrutiny.  It felt like\nreleasing software without testing it.<br/><br/>That's what all publishing used to be like.  If\nyou got ten people to read a manuscript, you were lucky.  But I'd\nbecome so used to publishing online that the old method now seemed\nalarmingly unreliable, like navigating by dead reckoning once you'd\ngotten used to a GPS.<br/><br/>The other thing I like about publishing online is that you can write\nwhat you want and publish when you want.  Earlier this year I wrote\n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/inequality.html\">something</a> that seemed suitable for a magazine, so\nI sent it to an editor I know.\nAs I was waiting to hear back, I found to my surprise that I was\nhoping they'd reject it.  Then I could put it online right away.\nIf they accepted it, it wouldn't be read by anyone for months, and\nin the meantime I'd have to fight word-by-word to save it from being\nmangled by some twenty five year old copy editor.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/opensource.html#f5n\"><font color=\"#777777\">5</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Many employees would <i>like</i> to build great things for the companies\nthey work for, but more often than not management won't let them.\nHow many of us have heard stories of employees going to management\nand saying, please let us build this thing to make money for you--\nand the company saying no?  The most famous example is probably Steve Wozniak,\nwho originally wanted to build microcomputers for his then-employer, HP.\nAnd they turned him down.  On the blunderometer, this episode ranks\nwith IBM accepting a non-exclusive license for DOS.  But I think this\nhappens all the time.  We just don't hear about it usually,\nbecause to prove yourself right you have to quit\nand start your own company, like Wozniak did.<br/><br/><b>Startups</b><br/><br/>So these, I think, are the three big lessons open source and blogging\nhave to teach business: (1) that people work harder on stuff they\nlike, (2) that the standard office environment is very unproductive,\nand (3) that bottom-up often works better than top-down.<br/><br/>I can imagine managers at this point saying: what is this guy talking\nabout?  What good does it do me to know that my programmers\nwould be more productive\nworking at home on their own projects?  I need their asses in here\nworking on version 3.2 of our software, or we're never going to\nmake the release date.<br/><br/>And it's true, the benefit that specific manager could derive from\nthe forces I've described is near zero.  When I say business can\nlearn from open source, I don't mean any specific business can.  I\nmean business can learn about new conditions the same way a gene\npool does.  I'm not claiming companies can get smarter, just that\ndumb ones will die.<br/><br/>So what will business look like when it has assimilated the lessons\nof open source and blogging?  I think the big obstacle preventing\nus from seeing the future of business is the assumption that people\nworking for you have to be employees.  But think about what's going\non underneath:  the company has some money, and they pay it to the\nemployee in the hope that he'll make something worth more than they\npaid him.  Well, there are other ways to arrange that relationship.\nInstead of paying the guy money as a salary, why not give it to him\nas investment?  Then instead of coming to your office to work on\nyour projects, he can work wherever he wants on projects of his own.<br/><br/>Because few of us know any alternative, we have no idea how much\nbetter we could do than the traditional employer-employee relationship.\nSuch customs evolve with glacial slowness.  Our \nemployer-employee relationship still retains a big chunk of\nmaster-servant DNA.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/opensource.html#f6n\"><font color=\"#777777\">6</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>I dislike being on either end of it.\nI'll work my ass off for a customer, but I resent being told what\nto do by a boss.  And being a boss is also horribly frustrating; \nhalf the time it's easier just to do stuff yourself than to get\nsomeone else to do it for you.\nI'd rather do almost anything than give or receive a\nperformance review.<br/><br/>On top of its unpromising origins, employment\nhas accumulated a lot of cruft over the years.  The list of what\nyou can't ask in job interviews is now so long that for convenience\nI assume it's infinite.  Within the\noffice you now have to walk on eggshells lest anyone \n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/say.html\">say</a> or do\nsomething that makes the company prey to a lawsuit.  And God help\nyou if you fire anyone.<br/><br/>Nothing shows more clearly that employment is not an ordinary economic\nrelationship than companies being sued for firing people.  In any\npurely economic relationship you're free to do what you want.  If\nyou want to stop buying steel pipe from one supplier and start\nbuying it from another, you don't have to explain why.  No one can\naccuse you of <i>unjustly</i> switching pipe suppliers.  Justice implies\nsome kind of paternal obligation that isn't there in\ntransactions between equals.<br/><br/>Most of the legal restrictions on employers are intended to protect\nemployees.  But you can't have action without an equal and opposite\nreaction.  You can't expect employers to have some kind of paternal\nresponsibility toward employees without putting employees in the\nposition of children.  And that seems a bad road to go down.<br/><br/>Next time you're in a moderately large city, drop by the main post\noffice and watch the body language of the people working there.\nThey have the same sullen resentment as children made to do\nsomething they don't want to.  Their union has exacted pay\nincreases and work restrictions that would have been the envy of\nprevious generations of postal workers, and yet they don't seem any\nhappier for it.  It's demoralizing\nto be on the receiving end of a paternalistic relationship, no\nmatter how cozy the terms.  Just ask any teenager.<br/><br/>I see the disadvantages of the employer-employee relationship because\nI've been on both sides of a better one: the investor-founder relationship.\nI wouldn't claim it's painless.  When I was running a\nstartup, the thought of our investors used to keep me up at night.\nAnd now that I'm an <a href=\"http://ycombinator.com\">investor</a>,\nthe thought of our startups keeps me\nup at night.  All the pain of whatever problem you're trying to\nsolve is still there.\nBut the pain hurts less when it isn't\nmixed with resentment.<br/><br/>I had the misfortune to participate in what amounted to a controlled\nexperiment to prove that.  After Yahoo bought our startup I went\nto work for them.  I was doing exactly the same work, except with\nbosses.  And to my horror I started acting like a child.  The \nsituation pushed buttons I'd forgotten\nI had.<br/><br/>The big advantage of investment over employment, as the examples of open\nsource and blogging suggest, is that people working on projects of\ntheir own are enormously more productive.  And a\n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/start.html\">startup</a> is a project\nof one's own in two senses, both of them important: it's creatively\none's own, and also economically ones's own.<br/><br/>Google is a rare example of a big company in tune with the forces\nI've described. They've tried hard to make their offices less sterile\nthan the usual cube farm.  They give employees who do great work\nlarge grants of stock to simulate the rewards of a startup.  They\neven let hackers spend 20% of their time on their own projects.<br/><br/>Why not let people spend 100% of their time on their own projects,\nand instead of trying to approximate the value of what they create,\ngive them the actual market value?  Impossible?  That is in fact\nwhat venture capitalists do.<br/><br/>So am I claiming that no one is going to be an employee anymore--\nthat everyone should go and start a startup?  Of course not.\nBut more people could do it than do it now.\nAt the moment, even the smartest students leave school thinking\nthey have to get a <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/hiring.html\">job</a>.  \nActually what they need to do is make\nsomething valuable.  A job is one way to do that, but the more\nambitious ones will ordinarily be better off taking money from an\ninvestor than an employer.<br/><br/>Hackers tend to think business is for MBAs.  But business\nadministration is not what you're doing in a startup.  What you're\ndoing is business <i>creation</i>.  And the first phase of that\nis mostly product creation-- that is, hacking.  That's the\nhard part.  It's a lot harder to create something people love than\nto take something people love and figure out how to make money from\nit.<br/><br/>Another thing that keeps people away from starting startups is the\nrisk.  Someone with kids and a mortgage should think twice before\ndoing it.  But most young hackers have neither.<br/><br/>And as the example of open source and blogging suggests, you'll\nenjoy it more, even if you fail.  You'll be working on your own\nthing, instead of going to some office and doing what you're told.\nThere may be more pain in your own company, but it won't hurt as\nmuch.<br/><br/>That may be the greatest effect, in the long run, of the forces \nunderlying open source and blogging: finally ditching the old\npaternalistic employer-employee relationship, and replacing it with\na purely economic one, between equals.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nSurvey by Forrester Research reported in the cover story of\nBusiness Week, 31 Jan 2005.
