{"href":"judgement.html","title":"Two Kinds of Judgement","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">April 2007<br/><br/>There are two different ways people judge you.  Sometimes judging\nyou correctly is the end goal.  But there's a second much more\ncommon type of judgement where it isn't.  We tend to regard all\njudgements of us as the first type.  We'd probably be happier if\nwe realized which are and which aren't.<br/><br/>The first type of judgement, the type where judging you is the end\ngoal, include court cases, grades in classes, and most competitions.\nSuch judgements can of course be mistaken, but because the goal is\nto judge you correctly, there's usually some kind of appeals process.\nIf you feel you've been misjudged, you can protest that you've been\ntreated unfairly.<br/><br/>Nearly all the judgements made on children are of this type, so we\nget into the habit early in life of thinking that all judgements\nare.<br/><br/>But in fact there is a second much larger class of judgements where\njudging you is only a means to something else.  These include college\nadmissions, hiring and investment decisions, and of course the\njudgements made in dating.  This kind of judgement is not really\nabout you.<br/><br/>Put yourself in the position of someone selecting players for a\nnational team.  Suppose for the sake of simplicity that this is a\ngame with no positions, and that you have to select 20 players.\nThere will be a few stars who clearly should make the team, and\nmany players who clearly shouldn't.  The only place your judgement\nmakes a difference is in the borderline cases.  Suppose you screw\nup and underestimate the 20th best player, causing him not to make\nthe team, and his place to be taken by the 21st best.  You've still\npicked a good team.  If the players have the usual distribution of\nability, the 21st best player will be only slightly worse than the\n20th best.  Probably the difference between them will be less than\nthe measurement error.<br/><br/>The 20th best player may feel he has been misjudged.  But your goal\nhere wasn't to provide a service estimating people's ability.  It\nwas to pick a team, and if the difference between the 20th and 21st\nbest players is less than the measurement error, you've still done\nthat optimally.<br/><br/>It's a false analogy even to use the word unfair to describe this\nkind of misjudgement.  It's not aimed at producing a correct estimate\nof any given individual, but at selecting a reasonably optimal set.<br/><br/>One thing that leads us astray here is that the selector seems to\nbe in a position of power.  That makes him seem like a judge.  If\nyou regard someone judging you as a customer instead of a judge,\nthe expectation of fairness goes away.  The author of a good novel\nwouldn't complain that readers were <i>unfair</i> for preferring a\npotboiler with a racy cover.  Stupid, perhaps, but not unfair.<br/><br/>Our early training and our self-centeredness combine to make us\nbelieve that every judgement of us is about us.  In fact most aren't.\nThis is a rare case where being less self-centered will make people\nmore confident.  Once you realize how little most people judging\nyou care about judging you accurately—once you realize that because\nof the normal distribution of most applicant pools, it matters least\nto judge accurately in precisely the cases where judgement has the\nmost effect—you won't take rejection so personally.<br/><br/>And curiously enough, taking rejection less personally may help you\nto get rejected less often.  If you think someone judging you will\nwork hard to judge you correctly, you can afford to be passive.\nBut the more you realize that most judgements are greatly influenced\nby random, extraneous factors—that most people judging you are\nmore like a fickle novel buyer than a wise and perceptive \nmagistrate—the more you realize you can do things to influence the\noutcome.<br/><br/>One good place to apply this principle is in college applications.\nMost high school students applying to college do it with the usual\nchild's mix of inferiority and self-centeredness: inferiority in\nthat they assume that admissions committees must be all-seeing;\nself-centeredness in that they assume admissions committees care\nenough about them to dig down into their application and figure out\nwhether they're good or not.  These combine to make applicants\npassive in applying and hurt when they're rejected.  If college\napplicants realized how quick and impersonal most selection processes\nare, they'd make more effort to sell themselves, and take the outcome\nless personally.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2007-04-01T00:00:00Z"}
