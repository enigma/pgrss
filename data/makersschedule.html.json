Meetings cost them\nmore.<br/><br/>There are two types of schedule, which I'll call the manager's\nschedule and the maker's schedule.  The manager's schedule is for\nbosses.  It's embodied in the traditional appointment book, with\neach day cut into one hour intervals.  You can block off several\nhours for a single task if you need to, but by default you change\nwhat you're doing every hour.<br/><br/>When you use time that way, it's merely a practical problem to meet\nwith someone.  Find an open slot in your schedule, book them, and\nyou're done.<br/><br/>Most powerful people are on the manager's schedule.  It's the\nschedule of command.  But there's another way of using time that's\ncommon among people who make things, like programmers and writers.\nThey generally prefer to use time in units of half a day at least.\nYou can't write or program well in units of an hour.  That's barely\nenough time to get started.<br/><br/>When you're operating on the maker's schedule, meetings are a\ndisaster.  A single meeting can blow a whole afternoon, by breaking\nit into two pieces each too small to do anything hard in.  Plus you\nhave to remember to go to the meeting.  That's no problem for someone\non the manager's schedule.  There's always something coming on the\nnext hour; the only question is what.  But when someone on the\nmaker's schedule has a meeting, they have to think about it.<br/><br/>For someone on the maker's schedule, having a meeting is like\nthrowing an exception.  It doesn't merely cause you to switch from\none task to another; it changes the mode in which you work.<br/><br/>I find one meeting can sometimes affect a whole day.   A meeting\ncommonly blows at least half a day, by breaking up a morning or\nafternoon.  But in addition there's sometimes a cascading effect.\nIf I know the afternoon is going to be broken up, I'm slightly less\nlikely to start something ambitious in the morning.  I know this\nmay sound oversensitive, but if you're a maker, think of your own\ncase.  Don't your spirits rise at the thought of having an entire\nday free to work, with no appointments at all?  Well, that means\nyour spirits are correspondingly depressed when you don't.  And\nambitious projects are by definition close to the limits of your\ncapacity.  A small decrease in morale is enough to kill them off.<br/><br/>Each type of schedule works fine by itself.  Problems arise when\nthey meet.  Since most powerful people operate on the manager's\nschedule, they're in a position to make everyone resonate at their\nfrequency if they want to.  But the smarter ones restrain themselves,\nif they know that some of the people working for them need long\nchunks of time to work in.<br/><br/>Our case is an unusual one.  Nearly all investors, including all\nVCs I know, operate on the manager's schedule.  But \n<a href=\"http://ycombinator.com\">Y Combinator</a>\nruns on the maker's schedule.  Rtm and Trevor and I do because we\nalways have, and Jessica does too, mostly, because she's gotten\ninto sync with us.<br/><br/>I wouldn't be surprised if there start to be more companies like\nus.  I suspect founders may increasingly be able to resist, or at\nleast postpone, turning into managers, just as a few decades ago\nthey started to be able to resist switching from jeans\nto suits.<br/><br/>How do we manage to advise so many startups on the maker's schedule?\nBy using the classic device for simulating the manager's schedule\nwithin the maker's: office hours.  Several times a week I set aside\na chunk of time to meet founders we've funded.  These chunks of\ntime are at the end of my working day, and I wrote a signup program\nthat ensures all the appointments within a given set of office hours\nare clustered at the end.  Because they come at the end of my day\nthese meetings are never an interruption.  (Unless their working\nday ends at the same time as mine, the meeting presumably interrupts\ntheirs, but since they made the appointment it must be worth it to\nthem.)  During busy periods, office hours sometimes get long enough\nthat they compress the day, but they never interrupt it.<br/><br/>\nWhen we were working on <a href=\"start.html\"><font color=\"#000099\">our own startup</font></a>, back in the 90s, I evolved\nanother trick for partitioning the day.  I used to program from\ndinner till about 3 am every day, because at night no one could\ninterrupt me.  Then I'd sleep till about 11 am, and come in and\nwork until dinner on what I called \"business stuff.\"  I never thought\nof it in these terms, but in effect I had two workdays each day,\none on the manager's schedule and one on the maker's.<br/><br/>When you're operating on the manager's schedule you can do something\nyou'd never want to do on the maker's: you can have speculative\nmeetings.  You can meet someone just to get to know one another.\nIf you have an empty slot in your schedule, why not?  Maybe it will\nturn out you can help one another in some way.<br/><br/>Business people in Silicon Valley (and the whole world, for that\nmatter) have speculative meetings all the time.  They're effectively\nfree if you're on the manager's schedule.  They're so common that\nthere's distinctive language for proposing them: saying that you\nwant to \"grab coffee,\" for example.<br/><br/>Speculative meetings are terribly costly if you're on the maker's\nschedule, though.  Which puts us in something of a bind.  Everyone\nassumes that, like other investors, we run on the manager's schedule.\nSo they introduce us to someone they think we ought to meet, or\nsend us an email proposing we grab coffee.  At this point we have\ntwo options, neither of them good: we can meet with them, and lose\nhalf a day's work; or we can try to avoid meeting them, and probably\noffend them.<br/><br/>Till recently we weren't clear in our own minds about the source\nof the problem.  We just took it for granted that we had to either\nblow our schedules or offend people.  But now that I've realized\nwhat's going on, perhaps there's a third option: to write something\nexplaining the two types of schedule.  Maybe eventually, if the\nconflict between the manager's schedule and the maker's schedule\nstarts to be more widely understood, it will become less of a\nproblem.<br/><br/>Those of us on the maker's schedule are willing to compromise.   We\nknow we have to have some number of meetings.  All we ask from those\non the manager's schedule is that they understand the cost.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Paul Buchheit, Jessica Livingston,\nand Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Related:</b><br/><br/></p></font>","date":"2009-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
