At first glance\nit doesn't seem there's anything to see.  It's not the sort of place\nthat has conspicuous monuments.  But if you look, there are subtle\nsigns you're in a place that's different from other places.<br/><br/><b>1. <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=stanford+university\">Stanford\nUniversity</a></b><br/><br/>Stanford is a strange place.  Structurally it is to an ordinary\nuniversity what suburbia is to a city.  It's enormously spread out,\nand feels surprisingly empty much of the time.  But notice the\nweather.  It's probably perfect.  And notice the beautiful mountains\nto the west.  And though you can't see it, cosmopolitan San Francisco\nis 40 minutes to the north.  That combination is much of the reason\nSilicon Valley grew up around this university and not some other\none.<br/><br/><b>2. <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=university+and+ramona+palo+alto\">University\nAve</a></b><br/><br/>A surprising amount of the work of the Valley is done in the cafes\non or just off University Ave in Palo Alto.  If you visit on a\nweekday between 10 and 5, you'll often see founders pitching\ninvestors.  In case you can't tell, the founders are the ones leaning\nforward eagerly, and the investors are the ones sitting back with\nslightly pained expressions.<br/><br/><b>3.  <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=165+university+ave+palo+alto\">The Lucky\nOffice</a></b><br/><br/>The office at 165 University Ave was Google's first.  Then it was\nPaypal's.  (Now it's <a href=\"http://wepay.com\">Wepay</a>'s.)  The interesting thing about it is\nthe location.  It's a smart move to put a startup in a place with\nrestaurants and people walking around instead of in an office park,\nbecause then the people who work there want to stay there, instead\nof fleeing as soon as conventional working hours end.  They go out\nfor dinner together, talk about ideas, and then come back and\nimplement them.<br/><br/>It's important to realize that Google's current location in an\noffice park is not where they started; it's just where they were\nforced to move when they needed more space.  Facebook was till\nrecently across the street, till they too had to move because they\nneeded more space.<br/><br/><b>4. <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=old+palo+alto\">Old\nPalo Alto</a></b><br/><br/>Palo Alto was not originally a suburb.  For the first 100 years or\nso of its existence, it was a college town out in the countryside.\nThen in the mid 1950s it was engulfed in a wave of suburbia that\nraced down the peninsula.  But Palo Alto north of Oregon expressway\nstill feels noticeably different from the area around it.  It's one\nof the nicest places in the Valley.  The buildings are old (though\nincreasingly they are being torn down and replaced with generic\nMcMansions) and the trees are tall.  But houses are very\nexpensive—around $1000 per square foot. This is post-exit\nSilicon Valley.<br/><br/>\n<b>5. <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=2900+sand+hill+road+menlo+park\">Sand\nHill Road</a></b><br/><br/>It's interesting to see the VCs' offices on the north side of Sand\nHill Road precisely because they're so boringly uniform.  The\nbuildings are all more or less the same, their exteriors express\nvery little, and they are arranged in a confusing maze.  (I've been\nvisiting them for years and I still occasionally get lost.) It's\nnot a coincidence.  These buildings are a pretty accurate reflection\nof the VC business.<br/><br/>If you go on a weekday you may see groups of founders there to meet\nVCs. But mostly you won't see anyone; bustling is the last word\nyou'd use to describe the atmos.  Visiting Sand Hill Road reminds\nyou that the opposite of \"down and dirty\" would be \"up and clean.\"<br/><br/><b>6.  <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=castro+and+villa+mountain+view\">Castro\nStreet</a></b><br/><br/>It's a tossup whether Castro Street or University Ave should be\nconsidered the heart of the Valley now.  University Ave would have\nbeen 10 years ago.  But Palo Alto is getting expensive.  Increasingly\nstartups are located in Mountain View, and Palo Alto is a place\nthey come to meet investors.  Palo Alto has a lot of different\ncafes, but there is one that clearly dominates in Mountain View:\n<a href=\"http://maps.google.com/places/us/ca/mountain-view/castro-st/201/-red-rock-coffee\">Red\nRock</a>.<br/><br/><b>7. <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=charleston+road+mountain+view\">Google</a></b><br/><br/>Google spread out from its first building in Mountain View \nto a lot of the surrounding ones.  But because the\nbuildings were built at different times by different people,\nthe place doesn't have the sterile, walled-off feel that a typical\nlarge company's headquarters have.  It definitely has a flavor of\nits own though.  You sense there is something afoot.  The general\natmos is vaguely utopian; there are lots of Priuses, and people who\nlook like they drive them.<br/><br/>You can't get into Google unless you know someone there.  It's very\nmuch worth seeing inside if you can, though.   Ditto for Facebook,\nat the end of California Ave in Palo Alto, though there is nothing\nto see outside.<br/><br/><b>8.  <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=skylonda\">Skyline\nDrive</a></b><br/><br/>Skyline Drive runs along the crest of the Santa Cruz mountains.  On\none side is the Valley, and on the other is the sea—which\nbecause it's cold and foggy and has few harbors, plays surprisingly\nlittle role in the lives of people in the Valley, considering how\nclose it is.  Along some parts of Skyline the dominant trees are\nhuge redwoods, and in others they're live oaks.  Redwoods mean those\nare the parts where the fog off the coast comes in at night; redwoods\ncondense rain out of fog.  The MROSD manages a collection of <a href=\"http://www.openspace.org/\">great walking trails</a> off\nSkyline.<br/><br/><b>9. <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=interstate+280+san+mateo\">280</a></b><br/><br/>Silicon Valley has two highways running the length of it: 101, which\nis pretty ugly, and 280, which is one of the more beautiful highways\nin the world.  I always take 280 when I have a choice.  Notice the\nlong narrow lake to the west? That's the San Andreas Fault.  It\nruns along the base of the hills, then heads uphill through Portola\nValley.  One of the MROSD trails runs <a href=\"http://www.openspace.org/preserves/pr_los_trancos.asp\">right along\nthe fault</a>.  A string of rich neighborhoods runs along the\nfoothills to the west of 280: Woodside, Portola Valley, Los Altos\nHills, Saratoga, Los Gatos.<br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/38037974@N00/3890299362/\">SLAC</a> goes right under 280 a little bit south of Sand Hill Road.  And a couple miles south of that is the Valley's equivalent of the \"Welcome to Las Vegas\" sign: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulbarroga/3443486941/\">The Dish</a>.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Notes</b><br/><br/>I skipped the <a href=\"http://www.computerhistory.org/\">Computer\nHistory Museum</a> because this is a list of where to see the Valley\nitself, not where to see artifacts from it.  I also skipped San\nJose.  San Jose calls itself the capital of Silicon Valley, but\nwhen people in the Valley use the phrase \"the city,\" they mean San\nFrancisco.  San Jose is a dotted line on a map.<br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Patrick Collison, and Jessica Livingston\nfor reading drafts of this.<br/><br/></br></p></font>","date":"2010-10-01T00:00:00Z"}
