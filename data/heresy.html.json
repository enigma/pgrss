{"href":"heresy.html","title":"Heresy","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">April 2022<br/><br/>One of the most surprising things I've witnessed in my lifetime is\nthe rebirth of the concept of heresy.<br/><br/>In his excellent biography of Newton, Richard Westfall writes about the\nmoment when he was elected a fellow of Trinity College:\n<blockquote>\n  Supported comfortably, Newton was free to devote himself wholly\n  to whatever he chose. To remain on, he had only to avoid the three\n  unforgivable sins: crime, heresy, and marriage.\n  <font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/heresy.html#f1n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">1</font></a>]</font>\n</blockquote>\nThe first time I read that, in the 1990s, it sounded amusingly\nmedieval. How strange, to have to avoid committing heresy. But when\nI reread it 20 years later it sounded like a description of\ncontemporary employment.<br/><br/>There are an ever-increasing number of opinions you can be fired\nfor. Those doing the firing don't use the word \"heresy\" to describe\nthem, but structurally they're equivalent. Structurally there are\ntwo distinctive things about heresy: (1) that it takes priority\nover the question of truth or falsity, and (2) that it outweighs\neverything else the speaker has done.<br/><br/>For example, when someone calls a statement \"x-ist,\" they're also\nimplicitly saying that this is the end of the discussion. They do\nnot, having said this, go on to consider whether the statement is\ntrue or not. Using such labels is the conversational equivalent of\nsignalling an exception. That's one of the reasons they're used:\nto end a discussion.<br/><br/>If you find yourself talking to someone who uses these labels a\nlot, it might be worthwhile to ask them explicitly if they believe\nany babies are being thrown out with the bathwater. Can a statement\nbe x-ist, for whatever value of x, and also true? If the answer is\nyes, then they're admitting to banning the truth. That's obvious\nenough that I'd guess most would answer no. But if they answer no,\nit's easy to show that they're mistaken, and that in practice such\nlabels are applied to statements regardless of their truth or\nfalsity.<br/><br/>The clearest evidence of this is that whether a statement is\nconsidered x-ist often depends on who said it. Truth doesn't work\nthat way. The same statement can't be true when one person says it,\nbut x-ist, and therefore false, when another person does.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/heresy.html#f2n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The other distinctive thing about heresies, compared to ordinary\nopinions, is that the public expression of them outweighs everything\nelse the speaker has done. In ordinary matters, like knowledge of\nhistory, or taste in music, you're judged by the average of your\nopinions. A heresy is qualitatively different. It's like dropping\na chunk of uranium onto the scale.<br/><br/>Back in the day (and still, in some places) the punishment for\nheresy was death. You could have led a life of exemplary goodness,\nbut if you publicly doubted, say, the divinity of Christ, you were\ngoing to burn. Nowadays, in civilized countries, heretics only get\nfired in the metaphorical sense, by losing their jobs. But the\nstructure of the situation is the same: the heresy\noutweighs everything else. You could have spent the last ten years\nsaving children's lives, but if you express certain opinions, you're\nautomatically fired.<br/><br/>It's much the same as if you committed a crime. No matter how\nvirtuously you've lived, if you commit a crime, you must still\nsuffer the penalty of the law. Having lived a previously blameless\nlife might mitigate the punishment, but it doesn't affect whether\nyou're guilty or not.<br/><br/>A heresy is an opinion whose expression is treated like a crime —\none that makes some people feel not merely that you're mistaken,\nbut that you should be punished. Indeed, their desire to see you\npunished is often stronger than it would be if you'd committed an\nactual crime. There are many on the far left who believe\nstrongly in the reintegration of felons (as I do myself), and yet\nseem to feel that anyone guilty of certain heresies should never\nwork again.<br/><br/>There are always some heresies — some opinions you'd be punished\nfor expressing. But there are a lot more now than there were a few\ndecades ago, and even those who are happy about this would have to\nagree that it's so.<br/><br/>Why? Why has this antiquated-sounding religious concept come back\nin a secular form? And why now?<br/><br/>You need two ingredients for a wave of intolerance: intolerant\npeople, and an ideology to guide them. The intolerant people are\nalways there. They exist in every sufficiently large society. That's\nwhy waves of intolerance can arise so suddenly; all they need is\nsomething to set them off.<br/><br/>I've already written an <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/conformism.html\"><u>essay</u></a> \ndescribing the aggressively\nconventional-minded. The short version is that people can be\nclassified in two dimensions according to (1) how independent- or\nconventional-minded they are, and (2) how aggressive they are about\nit. The aggressively conventional-minded are the enforcers of\northodoxy.<br/><br/>Normally they're only locally visible. They're the grumpy, censorious\npeople in a group — the ones who are always first to complain when\nsomething violates the current rules of propriety. But occasionally,\nlike a vector field whose elements become aligned, a large number\nof aggressively conventional-minded people unite behind some ideology\nall at once. Then they become much more of a problem, because a mob\ndynamic takes over, where the enthusiasm of each participant is\nincreased by the enthusiasm of the others.<br/><br/>The most notorious 20th century case may have been the Cultural\nRevolution. Though initiated by Mao to undermine his rivals, the\nCultural Revolution was otherwise mostly a grass-roots phenomenon.\nMao said in essence: There are heretics among us. Seek them out and\npunish them. And that's all the aggressively conventional-minded\never need to hear. They went at it with the delight of dogs chasing\nsquirrels.<br/><br/>To unite the conventional-minded, an ideology must have many of the\nfeatures of a religion. In particular it must have strict and\narbitrary rules that adherents can demonstrate their \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaHLd8de6nM\"><u>purity</u></a> \nby obeying, and its adherents must believe that anyone who obeys these\nrules is ipso facto morally superior to anyone who doesn't.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/heresy.html#f3n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">3</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>In the late 1980s a new ideology of this type appeared in US\nuniversities. It had a very strong component of moral purity, and\nthe aggressively conventional-minded seized upon it with their usual\neagerness — all the more because the relaxation of social norms\nin the preceding decades meant there had been less and less to\nforbid. The resulting wave of intolerance has been eerily similar\nin form to the Cultural Revolution, though fortunately much smaller\nin magnitude.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/heresy.html#f4n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">4</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>I've deliberately avoided mentioning any specific heresies here.\nPartly because one of the universal tactics of heretic hunters, now\nas in the past, is to accuse those who disapprove of the way in\nwhich they suppress ideas of being heretics themselves. Indeed,\nthis tactic is so consistent that you could use it as a way of\ndetecting witch hunts in any era.<br/><br/>And that's the second reason I've avoided mentioning any specific\nheresies. I want this essay to work in the future, not just now.\nAnd unfortunately it probably will. The aggressively conventional-minded\nwill always be among us, looking for things to forbid. All they\nneed is an ideology to tell them what. And it's unlikely the current\none will be the last.<br/><br/>There are aggressively conventional-minded people on both the right\nand the left. The reason the current wave of intolerance comes from\nthe left is simply because the new unifying ideology happened to\ncome from the left. The next one might come from the right. Imagine\nwhat that would be like.<br/><br/>Fortunately in western countries the suppression of heresies is\nnothing like as bad as it used to be. Though the window of opinions\nyou can express publicly has narrowed in the last decade, it's still\nmuch wider than it was a few hundred years ago. The problem is the\nderivative. Up till about 1985 the window had been growing ever\nwider. Anyone looking into the future in 1985 would have expected\nfreedom of expression to continue to increase. Instead it has\ndecreased.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/heresy.html#f5n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">5</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The situation is similar to what's happened with infectious diseases\nlike measles. Anyone looking into the future in 2010 would have\nexpected the number of measles cases in the US to continue to\ndecrease. Instead, thanks to anti-vaxxers, it has increased. The\nabsolute number is still not that high. The problem is the derivative.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/heresy.html#f6n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">6</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>In both cases it's hard to know how much to worry. Is it really\ndangerous to society as a whole if a handful of extremists refuse\nto get their kids vaccinated, or shout down speakers at universities?\nThe point to start worrying is presumably when their efforts start\nto spill over into everyone else's lives. And in both cases that\ndoes seem to be happening.<br/><br/>So it's probably worth spending some amount of effort on pushing\nback to keep open the window of free expression. My hope is that\nthis essay will help form social antibodies not just against current\nefforts to suppress ideas, but against the concept of heresy in\ngeneral. That's the real prize. How do you disable the concept of\nheresy? Since the Enlightenment, western societies have discovered\nmany techniques for doing that, but there are surely more to be\ndiscovered.<br/><br/>Overall I'm optimistic. Though the trend in freedom of expression\nhas been bad over the last decade, it's been good over the longer\nterm. And there are signs that the current wave of intolerance is\npeaking. Independent-minded people I talk to seem more confident\nthan they did a few years ago. On the other side, even some of the\n<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/18/opinion/cancel-culture-free-speech-poll.html\"><u>leaders</u></a> are starting to wonder if things have \ngone too far. And popular culture among the young has already moved on. \nAll we have\nto do is keep pushing back, and the wave collapses. And then we'll\nbe net ahead, because as well as having defeated this wave, we'll\nalso have developed new tactics for resisting the next one.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>] \nOr more accurately, biographies of Newton, since Westfall wrote\ntwo: a long version called <i>Never at Rest</i>, and a shorter one called\n<i>The Life of Isaac Newton</i>. Both are great. The short version moves\nfaster, but the long one is full of interesting and often very funny\ndetails. This passage is the same in both.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nAnother more subtle but equally damning bit of evidence is\nthat claims of x-ism are never qualified. You never hear anyone say\nthat a statement is \"probably x-ist\" or \"almost certainly y-ist.\"\nIf claims of x-ism were actually claims about truth, you'd expect\nto see \"probably\" in front of \"x-ist\" as often as you see it in\nfront of \"fallacious.\"<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>] \nThe rules must be strict, but they need not be demanding. So\nthe most effective type of rules are those about superficial matters,\nlike doctrinal minutiae, or the precise words adherents must use.\nSuch rules can be made extremely complicated, and yet don't repel\npotential converts by requiring significant sacrifice.<br/><br/>The superficial demands of orthodoxy make it an inexpensive substitute\nfor virtue. And that in turn is one of the reasons orthodoxy is so\nattractive to bad people. You could be a horrible person, and yet\nas long as you're orthodox, you're better than everyone who isn't.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f4n\"><font color=\"#000000\">4</font></a>] \nArguably there were two. The first had died down somewhat by\n2000, but was followed by a second in the 2010s, probably caused\nby social media.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f5n\"><font color=\"#000000\">5</font></a>] \nFortunately most of those trying to suppress ideas today still\nrespect Enlightenment principles enough to pay lip service to them.\nThey know they're not supposed to ban ideas per se, so they have\nto recast the ideas as causing \"harm,\" which sounds like something\nthat can be banned. The more extreme try to claim speech itself is\nviolence, or even that silence is. But strange as it may sound,\nsuch gymnastics are a good sign. We'll know we're really in trouble\nwhen they stop bothering to invent pretenses for banning ideas —\nwhen, like the medieval church, they say \"Damn right we're banning\nideas, and in fact here's a list of them.\"<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f6n\"><font color=\"#000000\">6</font></a>] \nPeople only have the luxury of ignoring the medical consensus\nabout vaccines because vaccines have worked so well. If we didn't\nhave any vaccines at all, the mortality rate would be so high that\nmost current anti-vaxxers would be begging for them. And the situation\nwith freedom of expression is similar. It's only because they live\nin a world created by the Enlightenment that kids from the suburbs\ncan play at banning ideas.<br/><br/><br/><br/><font color=\"888888\"><b>Thanks</b> to Marc Andreessen, Chris Best, \nTrevor Blackwell, Nicholas\nChristakis, Daniel Gackle, Jonathan Haidt, Claire Lehmann, Jessica\nLivingston, Greg Lukianoff, Robert Morris, and Garry Tan for reading\ndrafts of this.</font><br/><br/></font>","date":"2022-04-01T00:00:00Z"}
