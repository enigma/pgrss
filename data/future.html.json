Increasingly, startups want a couple hundred thousand\ndollars, not a couple million. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f1n\"><font color=\"#999999\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The opportunity is a lot less unexploited now.  Investors have\npoured into this territory from both directions.  VCs are much more\nlikely to make angel-sized investments than they were a year ago.\nAnd meanwhile the past year has seen a dramatic increase in a new\ntype of investor: the super-angel, who operates like an angel, but\nusing other people's money, like a VC.<br/><br/>Though a lot of investors are entering this territory, there is\nstill room for more.  The distribution of investors should mirror\nthe distribution of startups, which has the usual power law dropoff.\nSo there should be a lot more people investing tens or hundreds of\nthousands than millions. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f2n\"><font color=\"#999999\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>In fact, it may be good for angels that there are more people doing\nangel-sized deals, because if angel rounds become more legitimate,\nthen startups may start to opt for angel rounds even when they\ncould, if they wanted, raise series A rounds from VCs.  One reason\nstartups prefer series A rounds is that they're more prestigious.\nBut if angel investors become more active and better known, they'll\nincreasingly be able to compete with VCs in brand.<br/><br/>Of course, prestige isn't the main reason to prefer a series A\nround.  A startup will probably get more attention from investors\nin a series A round than an angel round.  So if a startup is choosing\nbetween an angel round and an A round from a good VC fund, I usually\nadvise them to take the A round. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f3n\"><font color=\"#999999\">3</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>But while series A rounds aren't going away, I think VCs should be\nmore worried about super-angels than vice versa.  Despite their\nname, the super-angels are really mini VC funds, and they clearly\nhave existing VCs in their sights.<br/><br/>They would seem to have history on their side.  \nThe pattern here seems the same\none we see when startups and established companies enter a new\nmarket.  Online video becomes possible, and YouTube plunges right\nin, while existing media companies embrace it only half-willingly,\ndriven more by fear than hope, and aiming more to protect their\nturf than to do great things for users.  Ditto for PayPal.  This\npattern is repeated over and over, and it's usually the invaders\nwho win. In this case the super-angels are the invaders.  Angel\nrounds are their whole business, as online video was for YouTube.\nWhereas VCs who make angel investments mostly do it as a way to\ngenerate deal flow for series A rounds.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f4n\"><font color=\"#999999\">4</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>On the other hand, startup investing is a very strange business.\nNearly all the returns are concentrated in a few big winners.  If\nthe super-angels merely fail to invest in (and to some extent\nproduce) the big winners, they'll be out of business, even if they\ninvest in all the others.<br/><br/><b>VCs</b><br/><br/>Why don't VCs start doing smaller series A rounds?  The sticking\npoint is board seats.  In a traditional series A round, the partner\nwhose deal it is takes a seat on the startup's board.  If we assume\nthe average startup runs for 6 years and a partner can bear to be\non 12 boards at once, then a VC fund can do 2 series A deals per\npartner per year.<br/><br/>It has always seemed to me the solution is to take fewer board\nseats.  You don't have to be on the board to help a startup.  Maybe\nVCs feel they need the power that comes with board membership to\nensure their money isn't wasted.  But have they tested that theory?\nUnless they've tried not taking board seats and found their returns\nare lower, they're not bracketing the problem.<br/><br/>I'm not saying VCs don't help startups.  The good ones help them a\nlot.  What I'm saying is that the kind of help that matters, you\nmay not have to be a board member to give.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f5n\"><font color=\"#999999\">5</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>How will this all play out?  Some VCs will probably adapt, by doing\nmore, smaller deals.  I wouldn't be surprised if by streamlining\ntheir selection process and taking fewer board seats, VC funds could\ndo 2 to 3 times as many series A rounds with no loss of quality.<br/><br/>But other VCs will make no more than superficial changes.  VCs are\nconservative, and the threat to them isn't mortal.  The VC funds\nthat don't adapt won't be violently displaced.  They'll edge gradually\ninto a different business without realizing it.  They'll still do\nwhat they will call series A rounds, but these will increasingly\nbe de facto series B rounds.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f6n\"><font color=\"#999999\">6</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>In such rounds they won't get the 25 to 40% of the company they do\nnow.  You don't give up as much of the company in later rounds\nunless something is seriously wrong.  Since the VCs who don't adapt\nwill be investing later, their returns from winners may be smaller.\nBut investing later should also mean they have fewer losers.  So\ntheir ratio of risk to return may be the same or even better.\nThey'll just have become a different, more conservative, type of\ninvestment.<br/><br/><b>Angels</b><br/><br/>In the big angel rounds that increasingly compete with series A\nrounds, the investors won't take as much equity as VCs do now.  And\nVCs who try to compete with angels by doing more, smaller deals\nwill probably find they have to take less equity to do it. Which\nis good news for founders: they'll get to keep more of the company.<br/><br/>The deal terms of angel rounds will become less restrictive\ntoo—not just less restrictive than series A terms, but less\nrestrictive than angel terms have traditionally been.<br/><br/>In the future, angel rounds will less often be for specific amounts\nor have a lead investor.  In the old days, the standard m.o. for\nstartups was to find one angel to act as the lead investor.  You'd\nnegotiate a round size and valuation with the lead, who'd supply\nsome but not all of the money.  Then the startup and the lead would\ncooperate to find the rest.<br/><br/>The future of angel rounds looks more like this: instead of a fixed\nround size, startups will do a rolling close, where they take money\nfrom investors one at a time till they feel they have enough.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f7n\"><font color=\"#999999\">7</font></a>]</font>\nAnd though there's going to be one investor who gives them the first\ncheck, and his or her help in recruiting other investors will\ncertainly be welcome, this initial investor will no longer be the\nlead in the old sense of managing the round.  The startup will now\ndo that themselves.<br/><br/>There will continue to be lead investors in the sense of investors\nwho take the lead in <i>advising</i> a startup.  They may also make\nthe biggest investment.  But they won't always have to be the one\nterms are negotiated with, or be the first money in, as they have\nin the past.  Standardized paperwork will do away with the need to\nnegotiate anything except the valuation, and that will get easier\ntoo.<br/><br/>If multiple investors have to share a valuation, it will be whatever\nthe startup can get from the first one to write a check, limited\nby their guess at whether this will make later investors balk.  But\nthere may not have to be just one valuation.  Startups are increasingly\nraising money on convertible notes, and convertible notes have not\nvaluations but at most valuation <i>caps</i>: caps on what the\neffective valuation will be when the debt converts to equity (in a\nlater round, or upon acquisition if that happens first).  That's\nan important difference because it means a startup could do multiple\nnotes at once with different caps.  This is now starting to happen,\nand I predict it will become more common.<br/><br/><b>Sheep</b><br/><br/>The reason things are moving this way is that the old way sucked\nfor startups.  Leads could (and did) use a fixed size round as a\nlegitimate-seeming way of saying what all founders hate to hear:\nI'll invest if other people will.  Most investors, unable to judge\nstartups for themselves, rely instead on the opinions of other\ninvestors.  If everyone wants in, they want in too; if not, not.\nFounders hate this because it's a recipe for deadlock, and delay\nis the thing a startup can least afford.  Most investors know this\nm.o. is lame, and few say openly that they're doing it.  But the\ncraftier ones achieve the same result by offering to lead rounds\nof fixed size and supplying only part of the money.  If the startup\ncan't raise the rest, the lead is out too.  How could they go ahead\nwith the deal?  The startup would be underfunded!<br/><br/>In the future, investors will increasingly be unable to offer\ninvestment subject to contingencies like other people investing.\nOr rather, investors who do that will get last place in line.\nStartups will go to them only to fill up rounds that are mostly\nsubscribed.  And since hot startups tend to have rounds that are\noversubscribed, being last in line means they'll probably miss the\nhot deals.  Hot deals and successful startups are not identical,\nbut there is a significant correlation. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f8n\"><font color=\"#999999\">8</font></a>]</font>\nSo investors who won't invest unilaterally will have lower returns.<br/><br/>Investors will probably find they do better when deprived of this\ncrutch anyway.   Chasing hot deals doesn't make investors choose\nbetter; it just makes them feel better about their choices.  I've\nseen feeding frenzies both form and fall apart many times, and as\nfar as I can tell they're mostly random. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f9n\"><font color=\"#999999\">9</font></a>]</font>\nIf investors can\nno longer rely on their herd instincts, they'll have to think more\nabout each startup before investing.  They may be surprised how\nwell this works.<br/><br/>Deadlock wasn't the only disadvantage of letting a lead investor\nmanage an angel round.  The investors would not infrequently collude\nto push down the valuation.  And rounds took too long to close,\nbecause however motivated the lead was to get the round closed, he\nwas not a tenth as motivated as the startup.<br/><br/>Increasingly, startups are taking charge of their own angel rounds.\nOnly a few do so far, but I think we can already declare the old\nway dead, because those few are the best startups.  They're the\nones in a position to tell investors how the round is going to work.\nAnd if the startups you want to invest in do things a certain way,\nwhat difference does it make what the others do?<br/><br/><b>Traction</b><br/><br/>In fact, it may be slightly misleading to say that angel rounds\nwill increasingly take the place of series A rounds.  What's really\nhappening is that startup-controlled rounds are taking the place\nof investor-controlled rounds.<br/><br/>This is an instance of a very important meta-trend, one that Y\nCombinator itself has been based on from the beginning: founders\nare becoming increasingly powerful relative to investors.  So if\nyou want to predict what the future of venture funding will be like,\njust ask: how would founders like it to be?  One by one, all the\nthings founders dislike about raising money are going to get\neliminated. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f10n\"><font color=\"#999999\">10</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Using that heuristic, I'll predict a couple more things.  One is\nthat investors will increasingly be unable to wait for startups to\nhave \"traction\" before they put in significant money.  It's hard\nto predict in advance which startups will succeed.  So most investors\nprefer, if they can, to wait till the startup is already succeeding,\nthen jump in quickly with an offer.  Startups hate this as well,\npartly because it tends to create deadlock, and partly because it\nseems kind of slimy.  If you're a promising startup but don't yet\nhave significant growth, all the investors are your friends in\nwords, but few are in actions.  They all say they love you, but\nthey all wait to invest. Then when you start to see growth, they\nclaim they were your friend all along, and are aghast at the thought\nyou'd be so disloyal as to leave them out of your round.  If founders\nbecome more powerful, they'll be able to make investors give them\nmore money upfront.<br/><br/>(The worst variant of this behavior is the tranched deal, where the\ninvestor makes a small initial investment, with more to follow if\nthe startup does well.  In effect, this structure gives the investor\na free option on the next round, which they'll only take if it's\nworse for the startup than they could get in the open market.\nTranched deals are an abuse.  They're increasingly rare, and they're\ngoing to get rarer.) \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f11n\"><font color=\"#999999\">11</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Investors don't like trying to predict which startups will succeed,\nbut increasingly they'll have to.  Though the way that happens won't\nnecessarily be that the behavior of existing investors will change;\nit may instead be that they'll be replaced by other investors with\ndifferent behavior—that investors who understand startups\nwell enough to take on the hard problem of predicting their trajectory\nwill tend to displace suits whose skills lie more in raising money\nfrom LPs.<br/><br/><b>Speed</b><br/><br/>The other thing founders hate most about fundraising is how long\nit takes.  So as founders become more powerful, rounds should start\nto close faster.<br/><br/>Fundraising is still terribly distracting for startups. If you're\na founder in the middle of raising a round, the round is the <a href=\"top.html\">top idea in your mind</a>, which means working on the\ncompany isn't.  If a round takes 2 months to close, which is\nreasonably fast by present standards, that means 2 months during\nwhich the company is basically treading water.  That's the worst\nthing a startup could do.<br/><br/>So if investors want to get the best deals, the way to do it will\nbe to close faster.   Investors don't need weeks to make up their\nminds anyway.  We decide based on about 10 minutes of reading an\napplication plus 10 minutes of in person interview, and we only\nregret about 10% of our decisions.  If we can decide in 20 minutes,\nsurely the next round of investors can decide in a couple days.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f12n\"><font color=\"#999999\">12</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>There are a lot of institutionalized delays in startup funding: the\nmulti-week mating dance with investors; the distinction between\ntermsheets and deals; the fact that each series A has enormously\nelaborate, custom paperwork.  Both founders and investors tend to\ntake these for granted.  It's the way things have always been.  But\nultimately the reason these delays exist is that they're to the\nadvantage of investors.  More time gives investors more information\nabout a startup's trajectory, and it also tends to make startups\nmore pliable in negotiations, since they're usually short of money.<br/><br/>These conventions weren't designed to drag out the funding process,\nbut that's why they're allowed to persist.  Slowness is to the\nadvantage of investors, who have in the past been the ones with the\nmost power.  But there is no need for rounds to take months or even\nweeks to close, and once founders realize that, it's going to stop.\nNot just in angel rounds, but in series A rounds too.  The future\nis simple deals with standard terms, done quickly.<br/><br/>One minor abuse that will get corrected in the process is option\npools.  In a traditional series A round, before the VCs invest they\nmake the company set aside a block of stock for future hires—usually\nbetween 10 and 30% of the company.  The point is to ensure this\ndilution is borne by the existing shareholders.  The practice isn't\ndishonest; founders know what's going on.  But it makes deals\nunnecessarily complicated.  In effect the valuation is 2 numbers.\nThere's no need to keep doing this.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"#f13n\"><font color=\"#999999\">13</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The final thing founders want is to be able to sell some of\ntheir own stock in later rounds.  This won't be a change, \nbecause the practice is now quite common.  A lot of investors\nhated the idea, but the world hasn't exploded as a result,\nso it will happen more, and more openly.<br/><br/><b>Surprise</b><br/><br/>I've talked here about a bunch of changes that will be forced on\ninvestors as founders become more powerful.  Now the good news:\ninvestors may actually make more money as a result.<br/><br/>A couple days ago an interviewer \n<a href=\"http://techcrunch.tv/watch?id=Q3amZtMTryrpiP80cbUtsV2ah92eZP2m\">asked \nme</a> if founders having more\npower would be better or worse for the world.  I was surprised,\nbecause I'd never considered that question.  Better or worse, it's\nhappening.  But after a second's reflection, the answer seemed\nobvious.  Founders understand their companies better than investors,\nand it has to be better if the people with more knowledge have more\npower.<br/><br/>One of the mistakes novice pilots make is overcontrolling the\naircraft: applying corrections too vigorously, so the aircraft\noscillates about the desired configuration instead of approaching\nit asymptotically.  It seems probable that investors have till now\non average been overcontrolling their portfolio companies.  In a\nlot of startups, the biggest source of stress for the founders is\nnot competitors but investors.  Certainly it was for us at Viaweb.\nAnd this is not a new phenomenon: investors were James Watt's biggest\nproblem too.   If having less power prevents investors from\novercontrolling startups, it should be better not just for founders\nbut for investors too.<br/><br/>Investors may end up with less stock per startup, but startups will\nprobably do better with founders more in control, and there will\nalmost certainly be more of them.  Investors all compete with one\nanother for deals, but they aren't one another's main competitor.\nOur main competitor is employers.  And so far that competitor is\ncrushing us.  Only a tiny fraction of people who could start a\nstartup do.  Nearly all customers choose the competing product, a\njob.  Why?  Well, let's look at the product we're offering.  An\nunbiased review would go something like this:\n<blockquote>\n  Starting a startup gives you more freedom and the opportunity to\n  make a lot more money than a job, but it's also hard work and at\n  times very stressful.\n</blockquote>\nMuch of the stress comes from dealing with investors.  If reforming\nthe investment process removed that stress, we'd make our product\nmuch more attractive.  The kind of people who make good startup\nfounders don't mind dealing with technical problems—they enjoy\ntechnical problems—but they hate the type of problems investors\ncause.<br/><br/>Investors have no\nidea that when they maltreat one startup, they're preventing 10\nothers from happening, but they are.  Indirectly, but they are.  So\nwhen investors stop trying to squeeze a little more out of their\nexisting deals, they'll find they're net ahead, because so many\nmore new deals appear.<br/><br/>One of our axioms at Y Combinator is not to think of deal flow as\na zero-sum game.  Our main focus is to encourage more startups to happen,\nnot to win a larger share of the existing stream.  We've found this\nprinciple very useful, and we think as it spreads outward it will\nhelp later stage investors as well.<br/><br/>\"Make something people want\"\napplies to us too.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nIn this essay I'm talking mainly about software startups.\nThese points don't apply to types of startups that are still expensive\nto start, e.g. in energy or biotech.<br/><br/>Even the cheap kinds of startups will generally raise large amounts\nat some point, when they want to hire a lot of people.  What has\nchanged is how much they can get done before that.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nIt's not the distribution of good startups that has a power\nlaw dropoff, but the distribution of potentially good startups,\nwhich is to say, good deals.  There are lots of potential winners,\nfrom which a few actual winners emerge with superlinear certainty.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nAs I was writing this, I asked some founders who'd taken\nseries A rounds from top VC funds whether it was worth it, and they\nunanimously said yes.<br/><br/>The quality of investor is more important than the type of round,\nthough.  I'd take an angel round from good angels over a series A\nfrom a mediocre VC.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f4n\"><font color=\"#000000\">4</font></a>]\nFounders also worry that taking an angel investment from a\nVC means they'll look bad if the VC declines to participate in the\nnext round.  The trend of VC angel investing is so new that it's\nhard to say how justified this worry is.<br/><br/>Another danger, pointed out by Mitch Kapor, is that if VCs are only\ndoing angel deals to generate series A deal flow, then their\nincentives aren't aligned with the founders'.  The founders want\nthe valuation of the next round to be high, and the VCs want it to\nbe low.  Again, hard to say yet how much of a problem this will be.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f5n\"><font color=\"#000000\">5</font></a>]\nJosh Kopelman pointed out that another way to be on fewer\nboards at once is to take board seats for shorter periods.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f6n\"><font color=\"#000000\">6</font></a>]\nGoogle was in this respect as so many others the pattern for\nthe future.  It would be great for VCs if the similarity extended\nto returns.  That's probably too much to hope for, but the returns\nmay be somewhat higher, as I explain later.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f7n\"><font color=\"#000000\">7</font></a>]\nDoing a rolling close doesn't mean the company is always\nraising money.  That would be a distraction.  The point of a rolling\nclose is to make fundraising take less time, not more.  With a\nclassic fixed sized round, you don't get any money till all the\ninvestors agree, and that often creates a situation where they all\nsit waiting for the others to act.  A rolling close usually prevents\nthis.<br/><br/><!-- [<a name=\"f8n\"><font color=#000000>8</font></a>]\nJeff Clavier pointed out a tax disadvantage of convertible\nnotes: they don't start the long term capital gains clock.  So\nperhaps the ultimate solution, after investors have been conditioned\nto do simpler deals with multiple caps by convertible notes, is\neventually to do equity rounds that approach the same simplicity\nand flexibility.\n-->\n[<a name=\"f8n\"><font color=\"#000000\">8</font></a>]\nThere are two (non-exclusive) causes of hot deals: the quality\nof the company, and domino effects among investors.  The former is\nobviously a better predictor of success.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f9n\"><font color=\"#000000\">9</font></a>]\nSome of the randomness is concealed by the fact that investment\nis a self fulfilling prophecy.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f10n\"><font color=\"#000000\">10</font></a>]\nThe shift in power to founders is exaggerated now because\nit's a seller's market.  On the next downtick it will seem like I\noverstated the case.  But on the next uptick after that, founders\nwill seem more powerful than ever.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f11n\"><font color=\"#000000\">11</font></a>]\nMore generally, it will become less common for the same\ninvestor to invest in successive rounds, except when exercising an\noption to maintain their percentage.  When the same investor invests\nin successive rounds, it often means the startup isn't getting\nmarket price.  They may not care; they may prefer to work with an\ninvestor they already know; but as the investment market becomes\nmore efficient, it will become increasingly easy to get market price\nif they want it.  Which in turn means the investment community will\ntend to become more stratified.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f12n\"><font color=\"#000000\">12</font></a>]\nThe two 10 minuteses have 3 weeks between them so founders\ncan get cheap plane tickets, but except for that they could be\nadjacent.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f13n\"><font color=\"#000000\">13</font></a>]\nI'm not saying option pools themselves will go away.  They're\nan administrative convenience.  What will go away is investors\nrequiring them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, John Bautista, Trevor Blackwell,\nPaul Buchheit, Jeff Clavier,\nPatrick Collison, Ron Conway, Matt Cohler, Chris Dixon, Mitch Kapor,\nJosh Kopelman, Pete Koomen, Carolynn Levy, Jessica Livingston, Ariel\nPoler, Geoff Ralston, Naval Ravikant, Dan Siroker, Harj Taggar, and \nFred Wilson\nfor reading drafts of this.<br/><br/></xa></br></p></font>","date":"2010-08-01T00:00:00Z"}
