{"href":"disagree.html","title":"How to Disagree","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">March 2008<br/><br/>The web is turning writing into a conversation.  Twenty years ago,\nwriters wrote and readers read.  The web lets readers respond, and\nincreasingly they do—in comment threads, on forums, and in their\nown blog posts.<br/><br/>Many who respond to something disagree with it.  That's to be\nexpected.  Agreeing tends to motivate people less than disagreeing.\nAnd when you agree there's less to say.  You could expand on something\nthe author said, but he has probably already explored the\nmost interesting implications.  When you disagree you're entering\nterritory he may not have explored.<br/><br/>The result is there's a lot more disagreeing going on, especially\nmeasured by the word.  That doesn't mean people are getting angrier.\nThe structural change in the way we communicate is enough to account\nfor it.  But though it's not anger that's driving the increase in\ndisagreement, there's a danger that the increase in disagreement\nwill make people angrier.  Particularly online, where it's easy to\nsay things you'd never say face to face.<br/><br/>If we're all going to be disagreeing more, we should be careful to\ndo it well.  What does it mean to disagree well?   Most readers can\ntell the difference between mere name-calling and a carefully\nreasoned refutation, but I think it would help to put names on the\nintermediate stages.  So here's an attempt at a disagreement\nhierarchy:<br/><br/>\n<b>DH0. Name-calling.</b><br/><br/>This is the lowest form of disagreement, and probably also the most\ncommon.  We've all seen comments like this:\n<blockquote>\n  u r a fag!!!!!!!!!!\n</blockquote>\nBut it's important to realize that more articulate name-calling has\njust as little weight.  A comment like\n<blockquote>\n  The author is a self-important dilettante.\n</blockquote>\nis really nothing more than a pretentious version of \"u r a fag.\"<br/><br/>\n<b>DH1. Ad Hominem.</b><br/><br/>An ad hominem attack is not quite as weak as mere name-calling.  It\nmight actually carry some weight.  For example, if a senator wrote\nan article saying senators' salaries should be increased, one could\nrespond:\n<blockquote>\n  Of course he would say that.  He's a senator.\n</blockquote>\nThis wouldn't refute the author's argument, but it may at least be\nrelevant to the case.  It's still a very weak form of disagreement,\nthough.  If there's something wrong with the senator's argument,\nyou should say what it is; and if there isn't, what difference does\nit make that he's a senator?<br/><br/>Saying that an author lacks the authority to write about a topic\nis a variant of ad hominem—and a particularly useless sort, because\ngood ideas often come from outsiders.  The question is whether the\nauthor is correct or not.  If his lack of authority caused him to\nmake mistakes, point those out.  And if it didn't, it's not a\nproblem.<br/><br/>\n<b>DH2. Responding to Tone.</b><br/><br/>The next level up we start to see responses to the writing, rather\nthan the writer.  The lowest form of these is to disagree with the\nauthor's tone.  E.g.\n<blockquote>\n  I can't believe the author dismisses intelligent design in such\n  a cavalier fashion.\n</blockquote>\nThough better than attacking the author, this is still a weak form\nof disagreement.  It matters much more whether the author is wrong\nor right than what his tone is.  Especially since tone is so hard\nto judge.  Someone who has a chip on their shoulder about some topic\nmight be offended by a tone that to other readers seemed neutral.<br/><br/>So if the worst thing you can say about something is to criticize\nits tone, you're not saying much.  Is the author flippant, but\ncorrect?  Better that than grave and wrong.  And if the author is\nincorrect somewhere, say where.<br/><br/><b>DH3. Contradiction.</b><br/><br/>In this stage we finally get responses to what was said, rather\nthan how or by whom.  The lowest form of response to an argument\nis simply to state the opposing case, with little or no supporting\nevidence.<br/><br/>This is often combined with DH2 statements, as in:\n<blockquote>\n  I can't believe the author dismisses intelligent design in such\n  a cavalier fashion.  Intelligent design is a legitimate scientific\n  theory.\n</blockquote>\nContradiction can sometimes have some weight.  Sometimes merely\nseeing the opposing case stated explicitly is enough to see that\nit's right.  But usually evidence will help.<br/><br/><b>DH4. Counterargument.</b><br/><br/>At level 4 we reach the first form of convincing disagreement:\ncounterargument.  Forms up to this point can usually be ignored as\nproving nothing.  Counterargument might prove something.  The problem\nis, it's hard to say exactly what.<br/><br/>Counterargument is contradiction plus reasoning and/or evidence.\nWhen aimed squarely at the original argument, it can be convincing.\nBut unfortunately it's common for counterarguments to be aimed at\nsomething slightly different.  More often than not, two people\narguing passionately about something are actually arguing about two\ndifferent things.  Sometimes they even agree with one another, but\nare so caught up in their squabble they don't realize it.<br/><br/>There could be a legitimate reason for arguing against something\nslightly different from what the original author said: when you\nfeel they missed the heart of the matter.  But when you do that,\nyou should say explicitly you're doing it.<br/><br/><b>DH5. Refutation.</b><br/><br/>The most convincing form of disagreement is refutation.  It's also\nthe rarest, because it's the most work.  Indeed, the disagreement\nhierarchy forms a kind of pyramid, in the sense that the higher you\ngo the fewer instances you find.<br/><br/>To refute someone you probably have to quote them.  You have to\nfind a \"smoking gun,\" a passage in whatever you disagree with that\nyou feel is mistaken, and then explain why it's mistaken.  If you\ncan't find an actual quote to disagree with, you may be arguing\nwith a straw man.<br/><br/>While refutation generally entails quoting, quoting doesn't necessarily\nimply refutation.  Some writers quote parts of things they disagree\nwith to give the appearance of legitimate refutation, then follow\nwith a response as low as DH3 or even DH0.<br/><br/><b>DH6. Refuting the Central Point.</b><br/><br/>The force of a refutation depends on what you refute.  The most\npowerful form of disagreement is to refute someone's central point.<br/><br/>Even as high as DH5 we still sometimes see deliberate dishonesty,\nas when someone picks out minor points of an argument and refutes\nthose.  Sometimes the spirit in which this is done makes it more\nof a sophisticated form of ad hominem than actual refutation.  For\nexample, correcting someone's grammar, or harping on minor mistakes\nin names or numbers.  Unless the opposing argument actually depends\non such things, the only purpose of correcting them is to\ndiscredit one's opponent.<br/><br/>Truly refuting something requires one to refute its central point,\nor at least one of them.  And that means one has to commit explicitly\nto what the central point is.  So a truly effective refutation would\nlook like:\n<blockquote>\n  The author's main point seems to be x.  As he says:\n<blockquote>\n    &lt;quotation&gt;\n</blockquote>\n  But this is wrong for the following reasons...\n</blockquote>\nThe quotation you point out as mistaken need not be the actual\nstatement of the author's main point.  It's enough to refute something\nit depends upon.<br/><br/>\n<b>What It Means</b><br/><br/>Now we have a way of classifying forms of disagreement.  What good\nis it?  One thing the disagreement hierarchy <i>doesn't</i> give us is\na way of picking a winner.  DH levels merely describe the form of\na statement, not whether it's correct.  A DH6 response could still\nbe completely mistaken.<br/><br/>But while DH levels don't set a lower bound on the convincingness\nof a reply, they do set an upper bound.  A DH6 response might be\nunconvincing, but a DH2 or lower response is always unconvincing.<br/><br/>The most obvious advantage of classifying the forms of disagreement\nis that it will help people to evaluate what they read.  In particular,\nit will help them to see through intellectually dishonest arguments.\nAn eloquent speaker or writer can give the impression of vanquishing\nan opponent merely by using forceful words.  In fact that is probably\nthe defining quality of a demagogue.  By giving names to the different\nforms of disagreement, we give critical readers a pin for popping\nsuch balloons.<br/><br/>Such labels may help writers too.  Most intellectual dishonesty is\nunintentional.  Someone arguing against the tone of something he\ndisagrees with may believe he's really saying something.  Zooming\nout and seeing his current position on the disagreement hierarchy\nmay inspire him to try moving up to counterargument or refutation.<br/><br/>But the greatest benefit of disagreeing well is not just that it\nwill make conversations better, but that it will make the people\nwho have them happier.  If you study conversations, you find there\nis a lot more meanness down in DH1 than up in DH6.  You don't have\nto be mean when you have a real point to make.  In fact, you don't\nwant to.  If you have something real to say, being mean just gets\nin the way.<br/><br/>If moving up the disagreement hierarchy makes people less mean,\nthat will make most of them happier.  Most people don't really enjoy\nbeing mean; they do it because they can't help it.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell and Jessica Livingston for reading\ndrafts of this.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Related:</b><br/><br/></font>","date":"2008-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
