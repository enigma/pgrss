{"href":"unions.html","title":"An Alternative Theory of Unions","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">May 2007<br/><br/>People who worry about the increasing gap between rich and poor\ngenerally look back on the mid twentieth century as a golden age.\nIn those days we had a large number of high-paying union manufacturing\njobs that boosted the median income.  I wouldn't quite call the\nhigh-paying union job a myth, but I think people who dwell on it\nare reading too much into it.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, it was working with startups that made me realize\nwhere the high-paying union job came from.  In a rapidly growing\nmarket, you don't worry too much about efficiency.  It's more\nimportant to grow fast.  If there's some mundane problem getting\nin your way, and there's a simple solution that's somewhat expensive,\njust take it and get on with more important things.  EBay didn't\nwin by paying less for servers than their competitors.<br/><br/>Difficult though it may be to imagine now, manufacturing was a\ngrowth industry in the mid twentieth century.  This was an era when\nsmall firms making everything from cars to candy were getting\nconsolidated into a new kind of corporation with national reach and\nhuge economies of scale.  You had to grow fast or die.  Workers\nwere for these companies what servers are for an Internet startup.\nA reliable supply was more important than low cost.<br/><br/>If you looked in the head of a 1950s auto executive, the attitude\nmust have been: sure, give 'em whatever they ask for, so long as\nthe new model isn't delayed.<br/><br/>In other words, those workers were not paid what their work was\nworth.  Circumstances being what they were, companies would have\nbeen stupid to insist on paying them so little.<br/><br/>If you want a less controversial example of this phenomenon, ask\nanyone who worked as a consultant building web sites during the\nInternet Bubble.  In the late nineties you could get paid huge sums\nof money for building the most trivial things.  And yet does anyone\nwho was there have any expectation those days will ever return?  I\ndoubt it.  Surely everyone realizes that was just a temporary\naberration.<br/><br/>The era of labor unions seems to have been the same kind of aberration, \njust spread\nover a longer period, and mixed together with a lot of ideology\nthat prevents people from viewing it with as cold an eye as they\nwould something like consulting during the Bubble.<br/><br/>Basically, unions were just Razorfish.<br/><br/>People who think the labor movement was the creation of heroic union\norganizers have a problem to explain: why are unions shrinking now?\nThe best they can do is fall back on the default explanation of\npeople living in fallen civilizations.  Our ancestors were giants.\nThe workers of the early twentieth century must have had a moral\ncourage that's lacking today.<br/><br/>In fact there's a simpler explanation.  The early twentieth century\nwas just a fast-growing startup overpaying for infrastructure.  And\nwe in the present are not a fallen people, who have abandoned\nwhatever mysterious high-minded principles produced the high-paying\nunion job.  We simply live in a time when the fast-growing companies\noverspend on different things.<br/><br/><br clear=\"all\"/></font>","date":"2007-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
