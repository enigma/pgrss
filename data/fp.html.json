People who would never\ndream of being fashionable in any other way get sucked into working\non fashionable problems.<br/><br/>If you want to try working on unfashionable problems, one of the\nbest places to look is in fields that people think have already been\nfully explored: essays, Lisp, venture funding Â— you may notice a\npattern here. If you can find a new approach into a big but apparently\nplayed out field, the value of whatever you discover will be\n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/sun.html\"><u>multiplied</u></a> by its enormous surface area.<br/><br/>The best protection against getting drawn into working on the same\nthings as everyone else may be to <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/genius.html\"><u>genuinely \nlove</u></a> what you're doing.\nThen you'll continue to work on it even if you make the same mistake\nas other people and think that it's too marginal to matter.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
