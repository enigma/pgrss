It felt as if there\nwas some kind of wall between us.  I could never quite tell if they\nunderstood what I was saying.<br/><br/>This caught my attention because earlier we'd noticed a pattern\namong the most successful startups, and it seemed to hinge on a\ndifferent quality.  We found the startups that did best were the\nones with the sort of founders about whom we'd say \"they can take\ncare of themselves.\"  The startups that do best are fire-and-forget\nin the sense that all you have to do is give them a lead, and they'll\nclose it, whatever type of lead it is.  When they're raising money,\nfor example, you can do the initial intros knowing that if you\nwanted to you could stop thinking about it at that point.  You won't\nhave to babysit the round to make sure it happens.  That type of\nfounder is going to come back with the money; the only question is\nhow much on what terms.<br/><br/>It seemed odd that the outliers at the two ends of the spectrum\ncould be detected by what appeared to be unrelated tests.  You'd\nexpect that if the founders at one end were distinguished by the\npresence of quality x, at the other end they'd be distinguished by\nlack of x.  Was there some kind of inverse relation between\n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/relres.html\">resourcefulness</a> and being hard to talk to?<br/><br/>It turns out there is, and the key to the mystery is the old adage\n\"a word to the wise is sufficient.\"   Because this phrase is not\nonly overused, but overused in an indirect way (by prepending the\nsubject to some advice), most people who've heard it don't know\nwhat it means.  What it means is that if someone is wise, all you\nhave to do is say one word to them, and they'll understand immediately.\nYou don't have to explain in detail; they'll chase down all the\nimplications.<br/><br/>In much the same way that all you have to do is give the right sort\nof founder a one line intro to a VC, and he'll chase down the money.\nThat's the connection.  Understanding all the implications — even the\ninconvenient implications — of what someone tells you is a subset of\nresourcefulness.  It's conversational resourcefulness.<br/><br/>Like real world resourcefulness, conversational resourcefulness\noften means doing things you don't want to.  Chasing down all the\nimplications of what's said to you can sometimes lead to uncomfortable\nconclusions.  The best word to describe the failure to do so is\nprobably \"denial,\" though that seems a bit too narrow.  A better\nway to describe the situation would be to say that the unsuccessful\nfounders had the sort of conservatism that comes from weakness.\nThey traversed idea space as gingerly as a very old person\ntraverses the physical world.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/word.html#f1n\"><font color=\"#999999\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The unsuccessful founders weren't stupid.  Intellectually they\nwere as capable as\nthe successful founders of following all the implications of what\none said to them.  They just weren't eager to.<br/><br/>So being hard to talk to was not what was killing the\nunsuccessful startups.  It\nwas a sign of an underlying lack of resourcefulness.  That's what\nwas killing them.  As well as\nfailing to chase down the implications of what was said to them,\nthe unsuccessful founders would also fail to chase down funding,\nand users, and sources of new ideas.  But the most immediate evidence\nI had that something was amiss was that I couldn't talk to them.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nA YC partner wrote:<br/><br/>My feeling with the bad groups is that coming into office hours,\nthey've already decided what they're going to do and everything I\nsay is being put through an internal process in their heads, which\neither desperately tries to munge what I've said into something\nthat conforms with their decision or just outright dismisses it and\ncreates a rationalization for doing so. They may not even be conscious\nof this process but that's what I think is happening when you say\nsomething to bad groups and they have that glazed over look. I don't\nthink it's confusion or lack of understanding per se, it's this\ninternal process at work.<br/><br/>With the good groups, you can tell that everything you say is being\nlooked at with fresh eyes and even if it's dismissed, it's because\nof some logical reason e.g. \"we already tried that\" or \"from speaking\nto our users that isn't what they'd like,\" etc. Those groups never\nhave that glazed over look.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Patrick Collison, Aaron Iba, Jessica Livingston,\nRobert Morris, Harj Taggar, and Garry Tan for reading drafts of\nthis.<br/><br/></br></p></font>","date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
