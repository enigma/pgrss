{"href":"charisma.html","title":"It's Charisma, Stupid","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\"><!-- <i>(This has been rewritten; the original version was wrong about\nthe 1968 election.)</i>\n-->\nNovember 2004, corrected June 2006<br/><br/>Occam's razor says we should prefer the simpler of two explanations.\nI begin by reminding readers of this principle because I'm about\nto propose a theory that will offend both liberals and conservatives.\nBut Occam's razor means, in effect, that if you want to disagree\nwith it, you have a hell of a coincidence to explain.<br/><br/>Theory: In US presidential elections, the more \ncharismatic candidate wins.<br/><br/>People who write about politics, whether on the left or the right,\nhave a consistent bias: they take politics seriously.  When one\ncandidate beats another they look for political explanations.  The\ncountry is shifting to the left, or the right.  And that sort of\nshift can certainly be the result of a presidential election, which\nmakes it easy to believe it was the cause.<br/><br/>But when I think about why I voted for Clinton over the first George\nBush, it wasn't because I was shifting to the left.  Clinton just\nseemed more dynamic.  He seemed to want the job more.  Bush seemed\nold and tired.  I suspect it was the same for a lot of voters.<br/><br/>Clinton didn't represent any national shift leftward.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f1n\"><font color=\"#777777\">1</font></a>]</font>\nHe was\njust more charismatic than George Bush or (God help us) Bob Dole.\nIn 2000 we practically got a controlled experiment to prove it:\nGore had Clinton's policies, but not his charisma, and he suffered\nproportionally. \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f2n\"><font color=\"#777777\">2</font></a>]</font>\nSame story in 2004. Kerry was smarter and more\narticulate than Bush, but rather a stiff.  And Kerry lost.<br/><br/>As I looked further back, I kept finding the same pattern.  \nPundits said Carter beat Ford\nbecause the country distrusted the Republicans after Watergate.\nAnd yet it also happened that Carter was famous for his big grin\nand folksy ways, and Ford for being a boring klutz.  Four years\nlater, pundits said the country had lurched to the right.  But\nReagan, a former actor, also happened to be even more charismatic\nthan Carter (whose grin was somewhat less cheery after four stressful\nyears in office).  In 1984 the charisma gap between Reagan and\nMondale was like that between Clinton and Dole, with similar results.\nThe first George Bush managed to win in 1988, though he would later\nbe vanquished by one of the most charismatic presidents ever, because\nin 1988 he was up against the notoriously uncharismatic\nMichael Dukakis.<br/><br/>These are the elections I remember personally, but apparently the\nsame pattern played out in 1964 and 1972.  The most recent\ncounterexample appears to be 1968, when Nixon beat the more charismatic Hubert\nHumphrey.  But when you examine that election, it tends to support\nthe charisma theory more than contradict it.  As Joe McGinnis\nrecounts in his famous book <i>The Selling of the President 1968</i>,\nNixon knew he had less charisma than Humphrey, and thus simply\nrefused to debate him on TV.  He knew he couldn't afford to let the\ntwo of them be seen side by side.<br/><br/>Now a candidate probably couldn't get away with refusing to debate.\nBut in 1968 the custom of televised debates was still evolving.  In\neffect, Nixon won in 1968 because voters were never allowed to see\nthe real Nixon.  All they saw were carefully scripted campaign\nspots.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, the most recent true counterexample is probably 1960.\nThough this election is usually given as an example of the power\nof TV, Kennedy apparently would not have won without fraud by party\nmachines in Illinois and Texas.  But TV was still young in 1960;\nonly 87% of households had it.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f3n\"><font color=\"#777777\">3</font></a>]</font>\nUndoubtedly TV helped Kennedy,\nso historians are correct in regarding this election as a\nwatershed.  TV required a new kind of candidate. There would be no\nmore Calvin Coolidges.<br/><br/>The charisma theory may also explain why Democrats tend to lose\npresidential elections.  The core of the Democrats' ideology seems\nto be a belief in government.  Perhaps this tends to attract people\nwho are earnest, but dull.  Dukakis, Gore, and Kerry were so similar\nin that respect that they might have been brothers.  Good thing for\nthe Democrats that their screen lets through an occasional Clinton,\neven if some scandal results.  \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"#f4n\"><font color=\"#777777\">4</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>One would like to believe elections are won and lost on issues, if\nonly fake ones like Willie Horton.  And yet, if they are, we have\na remarkable coincidence to explain.  In every presidential election\nsince TV became widespread, the apparently more charismatic candidate\nhas won.  Surprising, isn't it, that voters' opinions on the issues\nhave lined up with charisma for 11 elections in a row?<br/><br/>The political commentators who come up with shifts to the left or\nright in their morning-after analyses are like the financial reporters\nstuck writing stories day after day about the random fluctuations\nof the stock market.  Day ends, market closes up or down, reporter\nlooks for good or bad news respectively, and writes that the market\nwas up on news of Intel's earnings, or down on fears of instability\nin the Middle East.  Suppose we could somehow feed these reporters\nfalse information about market closes, but give them all the other\nnews intact.  Does anyone believe they would notice the anomaly,\nand not simply write that stocks were up (or down) on whatever good\n(or bad) news there was that day?  That they would say, hey, wait\na minute, how can stocks be up with all this unrest in the Middle\nEast?<br/><br/>I'm not saying that issues don't matter to voters.  Of course they\ndo.  But the major parties know so well which issues matter how\nmuch to how many voters, and adjust their message so precisely in\nresponse, that they tend to split the difference on the issues,\nleaving the election to be decided by the one factor they can't\ncontrol: charisma.<br/><br/>If the Democrats had been running a candidate as charismatic as\nClinton in the 2004 election, he'd have won.  And we'd be reading\nthat the election was a referendum on the war in Iraq, instead of\nthat the Democrats are out of touch with evangelical Christians in\nmiddle America.<br/><br/>During the 1992 election, the Clinton campaign staff had a big sign\nin their office saying \"It's the economy, stupid.\" Perhaps it was\neven simpler than they thought.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Postscript</b><br/><br/>Opinions seem to be divided about the charisma theory.  Some say\nit's impossible, others say it's obvious.  This seems a good sign.\nPerhaps it's in the sweet spot midway between.<br/><br/>As for it being impossible, I reply: here's the data; here's the\ntheory; theory explains data 100%.   To a scientist, at least, that\nmeans it deserves attention, however implausible it seems.<br/><br/>You can't believe voters are so superficial that they just choose\nthe most charismatic guy?  My theory doesn't require that.  I'm not\nproposing that charisma is the only factor, just that it's the only\none <i>left</i> after the efforts of the two parties cancel one\nanother out.<br/><br/>As for the theory being obvious, as far as I know, no one has\nproposed it before.  Election forecasters are proud when they can\nachieve the same results with much more complicated models.<br/><br/>Finally, to the people who say that the theory is probably true,\nbut rather depressing: it's not so bad as it seems.  The phenomenon\nis like a pricing anomaly; once people realize it's there, it will\ndisappear.  Once both parties realize it's a waste of time to\nnominate uncharismatic candidates, they'll tend to nominate only\nthe most charismatic ones.  And if the candidates are equally\ncharismatic, charisma will cancel out, and elections will be decided\non issues, as political commentators like to think they are now.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nAs Clinton himself discovered to his surprise when, in one of\nhis first acts as president, he tried to shift the military leftward.\nAfter a bruising fight he escaped with a face-saving compromise.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nTrue, Gore won the popular vote. But politicians know the electoral\nvote decides the election, so that's what they campaign for. If Bush\nhad been campaigning for the popular vote he would presumably have\ngot more of it.

Of the remaining 13%, 11 didn't\nhave TV because they couldn't afford it.  I'd argue that the missing\n11% were probably also the 11% most susceptible to charisma.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f4n\"><font color=\"#000000\">4</font></a>]\nOne implication of this theory is that parties shouldn't be too\nquick to reject candidates with skeletons in their closets.\nCharismatic candidates will tend to have more skeletons than squeaky\nclean dullards, but in practice that doesn't seem to lose elections.\nThe current Bush, for example, probably did more drugs in his\ntwenties than any preceding president, and yet managed to get elected\nwith a base of evangelical Christians.  All you have to do is say\nyou've reformed, and stonewall about the details.<br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Maria Daniels, Jessica Livingston,\nJackie McDonough, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this, and\nto Eric Raymond for pointing out that I was wrong about 1968.<br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://reddit.com\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/redditino.png?t=1688221954&amp;\"/></a>\n<a href=\"http://reddit.com/info/8zp7/comments\">\nComment</a> on this essay.<br/><br/><br clear=\"all\"/></font>","date":"2004-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
