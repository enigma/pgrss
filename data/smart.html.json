{"href":"smart.html","title":"Beyond Smart","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">October 2021<br/><br/>If you asked people what was special about Einstein, most would say\nthat he was really smart. Even the ones who tried to give you a\nmore sophisticated-sounding answer would probably think this first.\nTill a few years ago I would have given the same answer myself. But\nthat wasn't what was special about Einstein. What was special about\nhim was that he had important new ideas. Being very smart was a\nnecessary precondition for having those ideas, but the two are not\nidentical.<br/><br/>It may seem a hair-splitting distinction to point out that intelligence\nand its consequences are not identical, but it isn't. There's a big\ngap between them. Anyone who's spent time around universities and\nresearch labs knows how big. There are a lot of genuinely smart\npeople who don't achieve very much.<br/><br/>I grew up thinking that being smart was the thing most to be desired.\nPerhaps you did too. But I bet it's not what you really want. Imagine\nyou had a choice between being really smart but discovering nothing\nnew, and being less smart but discovering lots of new ideas. Surely\nyou'd take the latter. I would. The choice makes me uncomfortable,\nbut when you see the two options laid out explicitly like that,\nit's obvious which is better.<br/><br/>The reason the choice makes me uncomfortable is that being smart\nstill feels like the thing that matters, even though I know\nintellectually that it isn't. I spent so many years thinking it\nwas. The circumstances of childhood are a perfect storm for fostering\nthis illusion. Intelligence is much easier to measure than the value\nof new ideas, and you're constantly being judged by it. Whereas\neven the kids who will ultimately discover new things aren't usually\ndiscovering them yet. For kids that way inclined, intelligence is\nthe only game in town.<br/><br/>There are more subtle reasons too, which persist long into adulthood.\nIntelligence wins in conversation, and thus becomes the basis of\nthe dominance hierarchy.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"#f1n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">1</font></a>]</font>\nPlus having new ideas is such a new\nthing historically, and even now done by so few people, that society\nhasn't yet assimilated the fact that this is the actual destination,\nand intelligence merely a means to an end.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"#f2n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Why do so many smart people fail to discover anything new? Viewed\nfrom that direction, the question seems a rather depressing one.\nBut there's another way to look at it that's not just more optimistic,\nbut more interesting as well. Clearly intelligence is not the only\ningredient in having new ideas. What are the other ingredients?\nAre they things we could cultivate?<br/><br/>Because the trouble with intelligence, they say, is that it's mostly\ninborn. The evidence for this seems fairly convincing, especially\nconsidering that most of us don't want it to be true, and the\nevidence thus has to face a stiff headwind. But I'm not going\nto get into that question here, because it's the other ingredients\nin new ideas that I care about, and it's clear that many of them\ncan be cultivated.<br/><br/>That means the truth is excitingly different from the story I got\nas a kid. If intelligence is what matters, and also mostly inborn,\nthe natural consequence is a sort of <i>Brave New World</i> fatalism. The\nbest you can do is figure out what sort of work you have an \"aptitude\"\nfor, so that whatever intelligence you were born with will at least\nbe put to the best use, and then work as hard as you can at it.\nWhereas if intelligence isn't what matters, but only one of several\ningredients in what does, and many of those aren't inborn, things\nget more interesting. You have a lot more control, but the problem\nof how to arrange your life becomes that much more complicated.<br/><br/>So what are the other ingredients in having new ideas? The fact\nthat I can even ask this question proves the point I raised earlier\n— that society hasn't assimilated the fact that it's this and not\nintelligence that matters. Otherwise we'd all know the answers\nto such a fundamental question.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"#f3n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">3</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>I'm not going to try to provide a complete catalogue of the other\ningredients here. This is the first time I've posed\nthe question to myself this way, and I think it may take a while\nto answer. But I wrote recently about one of the most important:\nan obsessive <a href=\"genius.html\"><u>interest</u></a> in a particular topic. \nAnd this can definitely be cultivated.<br/><br/>Another quality you need in order to discover new ideas is\n<a href=\"think.html\"><u>independent-mindedness</u></a>. I wouldn't want to \nclaim that this is\ndistinct from intelligence — I'd be reluctant to call someone smart\nwho wasn't independent-minded — but though largely inborn, this\nquality seems to be something that can be cultivated to some extent.<br/><br/>There are general techniques for having new ideas — for example,\nfor working on your own <a href=\"own.html\"><u>projects</u></a>\nand\nfor overcoming the obstacles you face with <a href=\"early.html\"><u>early</u></a> work\n— and these\ncan all be learned. Some of them can be learned by societies. And\nthere are also collections of techniques for generating specific types\nof new ideas, like <a href=\"startupideas.html\">startup ideas</a> and \n<a href=\"essay.html\">essay topics</a>.<br/><br/>And of course there are a lot of fairly mundane ingredients in\ndiscovering new ideas, like <a href=\"hwh.html\"><u>working hard</u></a>, \ngetting enough sleep, avoiding certain\nkinds of stress, having the right colleagues, and finding tricks\nfor working on what you want even when it's not what you're supposed\nto be working on. Anything that prevents people from doing great\nwork has an inverse that helps them to. And this class of ingredients\nis not as boring as it might seem at first. For example, having new\nideas is generally associated with youth. But perhaps it's not youth\nper se that yields new ideas, but specific things that come with\nyouth, like good health and lack of responsibilities. Investigating\nthis might lead to strategies that will help people of any age to\nhave better ideas.<br/><br/>One of the most surprising ingredients in having new ideas is writing\nability. There's a class of new ideas that are best discovered by\nwriting essays and books. And that \"by\" is deliberate: you don't\nthink of the ideas first, and then merely write them down. There\nis a kind of thinking that one does by writing, and if you're clumsy\nat writing, or don't enjoy doing it, that will get in your way if\nyou try to do this kind of thinking.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"#f4n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">4</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>I predict the gap between intelligence and new ideas will turn out\nto be an interesting place. If we think of this gap merely as a measure\nof unrealized potential, it becomes a sort of wasteland that we try to\nhurry through with our eyes averted. But if we flip the question,\nand start inquiring into the other ingredients in new ideas that\nit implies must exist, we can mine this gap for discoveries about\ndiscovery.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nWhat wins in conversation depends on who with. It ranges from\nmere aggressiveness at the bottom, through quick-wittedness in the\nmiddle, to something closer to actual intelligence at the top,\nthough probably always with some component of quick-wittedness.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nJust as intelligence isn't the only ingredient in having new\nideas, having new ideas isn't the only thing intelligence is useful\nfor. It's also useful, for example, in diagnosing problems and figuring\nout how to fix them. Both overlap with having new ideas, but both\nhave an end that doesn't.<br/><br/>Those ways of using intelligence are much more common than having\nnew ideas. And in such cases intelligence is even harder to distinguish\nfrom its consequences.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nSome would attribute the difference between intelligence and\nhaving new ideas to \"creativity,\" but this doesn't seem a very\nuseful term. As well as being pretty vague, it's shifted half a frame\nsideways from what we care about: it's neither separable from\nintelligence, nor responsible for all the difference between\nintelligence and having new ideas.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f4n\"><font color=\"#000000\">4</font></a>]\nCuriously enough, this essay is an example. It started out\nas an essay about writing ability. But when I came to the distinction\nbetween intelligence and having new ideas, that seemed so much more\nimportant that I turned the original essay inside out, making that\nthe topic and my original topic one of the points in it. As in many\nother fields, that level of reworking is easier to contemplate once\nyou've had a lot of practice.<br/><br/><br/><br/><font color=\"888888\">\n<b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison, Jessica Livingston,\nRobert Morris, Michael Nielsen, and Lisa Randall for reading drafts\nof this.\n</font><br/><br/></font>","date":"2021-10-01T00:00:00Z"}
