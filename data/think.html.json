{"href":"think.html","title":"How to Think for Yourself","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">November 2020<br/><br/>There are some kinds of work that you can't do well without thinking\ndifferently from your peers. To be a successful scientist, for\nexample, it's not enough just to be correct. Your ideas have to be\nboth correct and novel. You can't publish papers saying things other\npeople already know. You need to say things no one else has realized\nyet.<br/><br/>The same is true for investors. It's not enough for a public market\ninvestor to predict correctly how a company will do. If a lot of\nother people make the same prediction, the stock price will already\nreflect it, and there's no room to make money. The only valuable\ninsights are the ones most other investors don't share.<br/><br/>You see this pattern with startup founders too. You don't want to\nstart a startup to do something that everyone agrees is a good idea,\nor there will already be other companies doing it. You have to do\nsomething that sounds to most other people like a bad idea, but\nthat you know isn't � like writing software for a tiny computer\nused by a few thousand hobbyists, or starting a site to let people\nrent airbeds on strangers' floors.<br/><br/>Ditto for essayists. An essay that told people things they already\nknew would be boring. You have to tell them something <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/useful.html\"><u>new</u></a>.<br/><br/>But this pattern isn't universal. In fact, it doesn't hold for most\nkinds of work. In most kinds of work � to be an administrator, for\nexample � all you need is the first half. All you need is to be\nright. It's not essential that everyone else be wrong.<br/><br/>There's room for a little novelty in most kinds of work, but in\npractice there's a fairly sharp distinction between the kinds of\nwork where it's essential to be independent-minded, and the kinds\nwhere it's not.<br/><br/>I wish someone had told me about this distinction when I was a kid,\nbecause it's one of the most important things to think about when\nyou're deciding what kind of work you want to do. Do you want to\ndo the kind of work where you can only win by thinking differently\nfrom everyone else? I suspect most people's unconscious mind will\nanswer that question before their conscious mind has a chance to.\nI know mine does.<br/><br/>Independent-mindedness seems to be more a matter of nature than\nnurture. Which means if you pick the wrong type of work, you're\ngoing to be unhappy. If you're naturally independent-minded, you're\ngoing to find it frustrating to be a middle manager. And if you're\nnaturally conventional-minded, you're going to be sailing into a\nheadwind if you try to do original research.<br/><br/>One difficulty here, though, is that people are often mistaken about\nwhere they fall on the spectrum from conventional- to independent-minded.\nConventional-minded people don't like to think of themselves as\nconventional-minded. And in any case, it genuinely feels to them\nas if they make up their own minds about everything. It's just a\ncoincidence that their beliefs are identical to their peers'. And\nthe independent-minded, meanwhile, are often unaware how different\ntheir ideas are from conventional ones, at least till they state\nthem publicly.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/think.html#f1n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>By the time they reach adulthood, most people know roughly how smart\nthey are (in the narrow sense of ability to solve pre-set problems),\nbecause they're constantly being tested and ranked according to it.\nBut schools generally ignore independent-mindedness, except to the\nextent they try to suppress it. So we don't get anything like the\nsame kind of feedback about how independent-minded we are.<br/><br/>There may even be a phenomenon like Dunning-Kruger at work, where\nthe most conventional-minded people are confident that they're\nindependent-minded, while the genuinely independent-minded worry\nthey might not be independent-minded enough.<br/><br/>\n<center>___________</center><br/><br/>\nCan you make yourself more independent-minded? I think so. This\nquality may be largely inborn, but there seem to be ways to magnify\nit, or at least not to suppress it.<br/><br/>One of the most effective techniques is one practiced unintentionally\nby most nerds: simply to be less aware what conventional beliefs\nare. It's hard to be a conformist if you don't know what you're\nsupposed to conform to. Though again, it may be that such people\nalready are independent-minded. A conventional-minded person would\nprobably feel anxious not knowing what other people thought, and\nmake more effort to find out.<br/><br/>It matters a lot who you surround yourself with. If you're surrounded\nby conventional-minded people, it will constrain which ideas you\ncan express, and that in turn will constrain which ideas you have.\nBut if you surround yourself with independent-minded people, you'll\nhave the opposite experience: hearing other people say surprising\nthings will encourage you to, and to think of more.<br/><br/>Because the independent-minded find it uncomfortable to be surrounded\nby conventional-minded people, they tend to self-segregate once\nthey have a chance to. The problem with high school is that they\nhaven't yet had a chance to. Plus high school tends to be an\ninward-looking little world whose inhabitants lack confidence, both\nof which magnify the forces of conformism.  So high school is\noften a <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/nerds.html\"><u>bad time</u></a> for the\nindependent-minded. But there is some advantage even here: it\nteaches you what to avoid. If you later find yourself in a situation\nthat makes you think \"this is like high school,\" you know you should\nget out.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/think.html#f2n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Another place where the independent- and conventional-minded are\nthrown together is in successful startups. The founders and early\nemployees are almost always independent-minded; otherwise the startup\nwouldn't be successful. But conventional-minded people greatly\noutnumber independent-minded ones, so as the company grows, the\noriginal spirit of independent-mindedness is inevitably diluted.\nThis causes all kinds of problems besides the obvious one that the\ncompany starts to suck. One of the strangest is that the founders\nfind themselves able to speak more freely with founders of other\ncompanies than with their own employees.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/think.html#f3n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">3</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Fortunately you don't have to spend all your time with independent-minded\npeople. It's enough to have one or two you can talk to regularly.\nAnd once you find them, they're usually as eager to talk as you\nare; they need you too. Although universities no longer have the\nkind of monopoly they used to have on education, good universities\nare still an excellent way to meet independent-minded people. Most\nstudents will still be conventional-minded, but you'll at least\nfind clumps of independent-minded ones, rather than the near zero\nyou may have found in high school.<br/><br/>It also works to go in the other direction: as well as cultivating\na small collection of independent-minded friends, to try to meet\nas many different types of people as you can. It will decrease the\ninfluence of your immediate peers if you have several other groups\nof peers. Plus if you're part of several different worlds, you can\noften import ideas from one to another.<br/><br/>But by different types of people, I don't mean demographically\ndifferent. For this technique to work, they have to think differently.\nSo while it's an excellent idea to go and visit other countries,\nyou can probably find people who think differently right around the\ncorner. When I meet someone who knows a lot about something unusual\n(which includes practically everyone, if you dig deep enough), I\ntry to learn what they know that other people don't. There are\nalmost always surprises here. It's a good way to make conversation\nwhen you meet strangers, but I don't do it to make conversation.\nI really want to know.<br/><br/>You can expand the source of influences in time as well as space,\nby reading history. When I read history I do it not just to learn\nwhat happened, but to try to get inside the heads of people who\nlived in the past. How did things look to them? This is hard to do,\nbut worth the effort for the same reason it's worth travelling far\nto triangulate a point.<br/><br/>You can also take more explicit measures to prevent yourself from\nautomatically adopting conventional opinions. The most general is\nto cultivate an attitude of skepticism. When you hear someone say\nsomething, stop and ask yourself \"Is that true?\" Don't say it out\nloud. I'm not suggesting that you impose on everyone who talks to\nyou the burden of proving what they say, but rather that you take\nupon yourself the burden of evaluating what they say.<br/><br/>Treat it as a puzzle. You know that some accepted ideas will later\nturn out to be wrong. See if you can guess which. The end goal is\nnot to find flaws in the things you're told, but to find the new\nideas that had been concealed by the broken ones. So this game\nshould be an exciting quest for novelty, not a boring protocol for\nintellectual hygiene. And you'll be surprised, when you start asking\n\"Is this true?\", how often the answer is not an immediate yes. If\nyou have any imagination, you're more likely to have too many leads\nto follow than too few.<br/><br/>More generally your goal should be not to let anything into your\nhead unexamined, and things don't always enter your head in the\nform of statements. Some of the most powerful influences are implicit.\nHow do you even notice these? By standing back and watching how\nother people get their ideas.<br/><br/>When you stand back at a sufficient distance, you can see ideas\nspreading through groups of people like waves. The most obvious are\nin fashion: you notice a few people wearing a certain kind of shirt,\nand then more and more, until half the people around you are wearing\nthe same shirt. You may not care much what you wear, but there are\nintellectual fashions too, and you definitely don't want to participate\nin those. Not just because you want sovereignty over your own\nthoughts, but because <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/nov.html\"><u>unfashionable</u></a>\nideas are disproportionately likely to lead somewhere interesting.\nThe best place to find undiscovered ideas is where no one else is\nlooking.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/think.html#f4n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">4</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>\n<center>___________</center><br/><br/>\nTo go beyond this general advice, we need to look at the internal\nstructure of independent-mindedness � at the individual muscles\nwe need to exercise, as it were. It seems to me that it has three\ncomponents: fastidiousness about truth, resistance to being told\nwhat to think, and curiosity.<br/><br/>Fastidiousness about truth means more than just not believing things\nthat are false. It means being careful about degree of belief. For\nmost people, degree of belief rushes unexamined toward the extremes:\nthe unlikely becomes impossible, and the probable becomes certain.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/think.html#f5n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">5</font></a>]</font>\nTo the independent-minded, this seems unpardonably sloppy.\nThey're willing to have anything in their heads, from highly\nspeculative hypotheses to (apparent) tautologies, but on subjects\nthey care about, everything has to be labelled with a carefully\nconsidered degree of belief.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/think.html#f6n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">6</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The independent-minded thus have a horror of ideologies, which\nrequire one to accept a whole collection of beliefs at once, and\nto treat them as articles of faith. To an independent-minded person\nthat would seem revolting, just as it would seem to someone fastidious\nabout food to take a bite of a submarine sandwich filled with a\nlarge variety of ingredients of indeterminate age and provenance.<br/><br/>Without this fastidiousness about truth, you can't be truly\nindependent-minded. It's not enough just to have resistance to being\ntold what to think. Those kind of people reject conventional ideas\nonly to replace them with the most random conspiracy theories. And\nsince these conspiracy theories have often been manufactured to\ncapture them, they end up being less independent-minded than ordinary\npeople, because they're subject to a much more exacting master than\nmere convention.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/think.html#f7n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">7</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Can you increase your fastidiousness about truth? I would think so.\nIn my experience, merely thinking about something you're fastidious\nabout causes that fastidiousness to grow. If so, this is one of\nthose rare virtues we can have more of merely by wanting it. And\nif it's like other forms of fastidiousness, it should also be\npossible to encourage in children. I certainly got a strong dose\nof it from my father.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/think.html#f8n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">8</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The second component of independent-mindedness, resistance to being\ntold what to think, is the most visible of the three. But even this\nis often misunderstood. The big mistake people make about it is to\nthink of it as a merely negative quality. The language we use\nreinforces that idea. You're <i>un</i>conventional. You <i>don't</i> care\nwhat other people think. But it's not just a kind of immunity. In\nthe most independent-minded people, the desire not to be told what\nto think is a positive force. It's not mere skepticism, but an\nactive <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/gba.html\"><u>delight</u></a> in ideas that subvert\nthe conventional wisdom, the more counterintuitive the better.<br/><br/>Some of the most novel ideas seemed at the time almost like practical\njokes. Think how often your reaction to a novel idea is to laugh.\nI don't think it's because novel ideas are funny per se, but because\nnovelty and humor share a certain kind of surprisingness. But while\nnot identical, the two are close enough that there is a definite\ncorrelation between having a sense of humor and being independent-minded\n� just as there is between being humorless and being conventional-minded.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/think.html#f9n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">9</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>I don't think we can significantly increase our resistance to being\ntold what to think. It seems the most innate of the three components\nof independent-mindedness; people who have this quality as adults\nusually showed all too visible signs of it as children. But if we\ncan't increase our resistance to being told what to think, we can\nat least shore it up, by surrounding ourselves with other\nindependent-minded people.<br/><br/>The third component of independent-mindedness, curiosity, may be\nthe most interesting. To the extent that we can give a brief answer\nto the question of where novel ideas come from, it's curiosity. That's\nwhat people are usually feeling before having them.<br/><br/>In my experience, independent-mindedness and curiosity predict one\nanother perfectly. Everyone I know who's independent-minded is\ndeeply curious, and everyone I know who's conventional-minded isn't.\nExcept, curiously, children. All small children are curious. Perhaps\nthe reason is that even the conventional-minded have to be curious\nin the beginning, in order to learn what the conventions are. Whereas\nthe independent-minded are the gluttons of curiosity, who keep\neating even after they're full.\n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/think.html#f10n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">10</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The three components of independent-mindedness work in concert:\nfastidiousness about truth and resistance to being told what to\nthink leave space in your brain, and curiosity finds new ideas to\nfill it.<br/><br/>Interestingly, the three components can substitute for one another\nin much the same way muscles can. If you're sufficiently fastidious\nabout truth, you don't need to be as resistant to being told what\nto think, because fastidiousness alone will create sufficient gaps\nin your knowledge. And either one can compensate for curiosity,\nbecause if you create enough space in your brain, your discomfort\nat the resulting vacuum will add force to your curiosity. Or curiosity\ncan compensate for them: if you're sufficiently curious, you don't\nneed to clear space in your brain, because the new ideas you discover\nwill push out the conventional ones you acquired by default.<br/><br/>Because the components of independent-mindedness are so interchangeable,\nyou can have them to varying degrees and still get the same result.\nSo there is not just a single model of independent-mindedness. Some\nindependent-minded people are openly subversive, and others are\nquietly curious. They all know the secret handshake though.<br/><br/>Is there a way to cultivate curiosity? To start with, you want to\navoid situations that suppress it. How much does the work you're\ncurrently doing engage your curiosity? If the answer is \"not much,\"\nmaybe you should change something.<br/><br/>The most important active step you can take to cultivate your\ncuriosity is probably to seek out the topics that engage it. Few\nadults are equally curious about everything, and it doesn't seem\nas if you can choose which topics interest you. So it's up to you\nto <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/genius.html\"><u>find</u></a> them. Or invent them, if\nnecessary.<br/><br/>Another way to increase your curiosity is to indulge it, by\ninvestigating things you're interested in. Curiosity is unlike\nmost other appetites in this respect: indulging it tends to increase\nrather than to sate it. Questions lead to more questions.<br/><br/>Curiosity seems to be more individual than fastidiousness about\ntruth or resistance to being told what to think. To the degree\npeople have the latter two, they're usually pretty general, whereas\ndifferent people can be curious about very different things. So\nperhaps curiosity is the compass here. Perhaps, if your goal is to\ndiscover novel ideas, your motto should not be \"do what you love\"\nso much as \"do what you're curious about.\"<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nOne convenient consequence of the fact that no one identifies\nas conventional-minded is that you can say what you like about\nconventional-minded people without getting in too much trouble.\nWhen I wrote <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/conformism.html\"><u>\"The Four Quadrants of\nConformism\"</u></a> I expected a firestorm of rage from the\naggressively conventional-minded, but in fact it was quite muted.\nThey sensed that there was something about the essay that they\ndisliked intensely, but they had a hard time finding a specific\npassage to pin it on.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nWhen I ask myself what in my life is like high school, the\nanswer is Twitter. It's not just full of conventional-minded people,\nas anything its size will inevitably be, but subject to violent\nstorms of conventional-mindedness that remind me of descriptions\nof Jupiter. But while it probably is a net loss to spend time there,\nit has at least made me think more about the distinction between\nindependent- and conventional-mindedness, which I probably wouldn't\nhave done otherwise.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nThe decrease in independent-mindedness in growing startups is\nstill an open problem, but there may be solutions.<br/><br/>Founders can delay the problem by making a conscious effort only\nto hire independent-minded people. Which of course also has the\nancillary benefit that they have better ideas.<br/><br/>Another possible solution is to create policies that somehow disrupt\nthe force of conformism, much as control rods slow chain reactions,\nso that the conventional-minded aren't as dangerous. The physical\nseparation of Lockheed's Skunk Works may have had this as a side\nbenefit. Recent examples suggest employee forums like Slack may not\nbe an unmitigated good.<br/><br/>The most radical solution would be to grow revenues without growing\nthe company. You think hiring that junior PR person will be cheap,\ncompared to a programmer, but what will be the effect on the average\nlevel of independent-mindedness in your company? (The growth in\nstaff relative to faculty seems to have had a similar effect on\nuniversities.) Perhaps the rule about outsourcing work that's not\nyour \"core competency\" should be augmented by one about outsourcing\nwork done by people who'd ruin your culture as employees.<br/><br/>Some investment firms already seem to be able to grow revenues\nwithout growing the number of employees. Automation plus the ever\nincreasing articulation of the \"tech stack\" suggest this may one\nday be possible for product companies.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f4n\"><font color=\"#000000\">4</font></a>]\nThere are intellectual fashions in every field, but their\ninfluence varies. One of the reasons politics, for example, tends\nto be boring is that it's so extremely subject to them. The threshold\nfor having opinions about politics is much <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/identity.html\"><u>lower</u></a> than the one for having\nopinions about set theory. So while there are some ideas in politics,\nin practice they tend to be swamped by waves of intellectual fashion.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f5n\"><font color=\"#000000\">5</font></a>]\nThe conventional-minded are often fooled by the strength of\ntheir opinions into believing that they're independent-minded. But\nstrong convictions are not a sign of independent-mindedness. Rather\nthe opposite.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f6n\"><font color=\"#000000\">6</font></a>]\nFastidiousness about truth doesn't imply that an independent-minded\nperson won't be dishonest, but that he won't be deluded. It's sort\nof like the definition of a gentleman as someone who is never\nunintentionally rude.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f7n\"><font color=\"#000000\">7</font></a>]\nYou see this especially among political extremists. They think\nthemselves nonconformists, but actually they're niche conformists.\nTheir opinions may be different from the average person's, but they\nare often more influenced by their peers' opinions than the average\nperson's are.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f8n\"><font color=\"#000000\">8</font></a>]\nIf we broaden the concept of fastidiousness about truth so that\nit excludes pandering, bogusness, and pomposity as well as falsehood\nin the strict sense, our model of independent-mindedness can expand\nfurther into the arts.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f9n\"><font color=\"#000000\">9</font></a>]\nThis correlation is far from perfect, though. G�del and Dirac\ndon't seem to have been very strong in the humor department. But\nsomeone who is both \"neurotypical\" and humorless is very likely to\nbe conventional-minded.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f10n\"><font color=\"#000000\">10</font></a>]\nException: gossip. Almost everyone is curious about gossip.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Paul Buchheit, Patrick Collison, Jessica\nLivingston, Robert Morris, Harj Taggar, and Peter Thiel for reading\ndrafts of this.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2020-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
