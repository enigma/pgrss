{"href":"speak.html","title":"Writing and Speaking","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">March 2012<br/><br/>I'm not a very good speaker.  I say \"um\" a lot. Sometimes I have\nto pause when I lose my train of thought.  I wish I were a better\nspeaker.  But I don't wish I were a better speaker like I wish I\nwere a better writer.  What I really want is to have good ideas,\nand that's a much bigger part of being a good writer than being a\ngood speaker.<br/><br/>Having good ideas is most of writing well.  If you know what you're\ntalking about, you can say it in the plainest words and you'll be\nperceived as having a good style.  With speaking it's the opposite:\nhaving good ideas is an alarmingly small component of being a good\nspeaker.<br/><br/>I first noticed this at a conference several years ago.\nThere was another speaker who was much better than me.\nHe had all of us roaring with laughter.  I seemed awkward and\nhalting by comparison.  Afterward I put my talk online like I usually\ndo.  As I was doing it I tried to imagine what a transcript of the\nother guy's talk would be like, and it was only then I realized he\nhadn't said very much.<br/><br/>Maybe this would have been obvious to someone who knew more about\nspeaking, but it was a revelation to me how much less ideas mattered\nin speaking than writing.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/speak.html#f1n\"><font color=\"#999999\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>A few years later I heard a talk by someone who was not merely a\nbetter speaker than me, but a famous speaker.  Boy was he good.  So\nI decided I'd pay close attention to what he said, to learn how he\ndid it.  After about ten sentences I found myself thinking \"I don't\nwant to be a good speaker.\"<br/><br/>Being a really good speaker is not merely orthogonal to having good ideas,\nbut in many ways pushes you in the opposite direction.  For example,\nwhen I give a talk, I usually write it out beforehand.  I know that's\na mistake; I know delivering a \nprewritten \ntalk makes it harder to\nengage with an audience.  The way to get the attention of an audience\nis to give them <i>your</i> full attention, and when you're delivering\na prewritten talk, your attention is always divided between the\naudience and the talk — even if you've memorized it.  If you want\nto engage an audience, it's better to start with no more than an outline\nof what you want to say and \nad lib the individual sentences.  But\nif you do that, you might spend no more time thinking about each\nsentence than it takes to say it.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/speak.html#f2n\"><font color=\"#999999\">2</font></a>]</font>\nOccasionally the stimulation\nof talking to a live audience makes you think of new things, but\nin general this is not going to generate ideas as well as writing\ndoes, where you can spend as long on each sentence as you want.<br/><br/>If you rehearse a prewritten speech enough, you can get\nasymptotically close to the sort of engagement you get when speaking\nad lib.  Actors do.  But here again there's a tradeoff between\nsmoothness and ideas.  All the time you spend practicing a talk,\nyou could instead spend making it better.  Actors don't face\nthat temptation, except in the rare cases where they've written the\nscript, but any speaker does.  Before I give a talk I can usually\nbe found sitting in a corner somewhere with a copy printed out on\npaper, trying to rehearse it in my head.  But I always end up\nspending most of the time rewriting it instead.  Every talk I give\nends up being given from a manuscript full of things crossed out\nand rewritten.  Which of course makes me um even more, because I\nhaven't had any time to practice the new bits.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/speak.html#f3n\"><font color=\"#999999\">3</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Depending on your audience, there are even worse tradeoffs than\nthese.  Audiences like to be flattered; they like jokes; they like\nto be swept off their feet by a vigorous stream of words.  As you\ndecrease the intelligence of the audience, being a good speaker is\nincreasingly a matter of being a good bullshitter.  That's true in\nwriting too of course, but the descent is steeper with talks.  Any\ngiven person is dumber as a member of an audience than as a reader.\nJust as a speaker ad libbing can only spend as long thinking about\neach sentence as it takes to say it, a person hearing a talk can\nonly spend as long thinking about each sentence as it takes to hear\nit.  Plus people in an audience are always affected by the reactions\nof those around them, and the reactions that spread from person to\nperson in an audience are disproportionately the more brutish sort,\njust as low notes travel through walls better than high ones.  Every\naudience is an incipient mob, and a good speaker uses that.  Part\nof the reason I laughed so much at the talk by the good speaker at\nthat conference was that everyone else did.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/speak.html#f4n\"><font color=\"#999999\">4</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>So are talks useless?  They're certainly inferior to the written\nword as a source of ideas.  But that's not all talks are good for.\nWhen I go to a talk, it's usually because I'm interested in the\nspeaker.  Listening to a talk is the closest most of us can get to\nhaving a conversation with someone like the president, who doesn't\nhave time to meet individually with all the people who want to meet\nhim.<br/><br/>Talks are also good at motivating me to do things.  It's probably\nno coincidence that so many famous speakers are described as\nmotivational speakers.  That may be what public speaking is really\nfor.  It's probably what it was originally for.  The emotional\nreactions you can elicit with a talk can be a powerful force.\nI wish I could say that this force was more often used for good than\nill, but I'm not sure.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nI'm not talking here about academic talks, which are a \ndifferent type of thing.  While the\naudience at an academic talk might appreciate a joke, they will (or\nat least should) make a conscious effort to see what new ideas\nyou're presenting.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nThat's the lower bound.  In practice you can often do better,\nbecause talks are usually about things you've written or talked\nabout before, and when you ad lib, you end up reproducing some of\nthose sentences.  Like early medieval architecture, impromptu talks\nare made of spolia.  Which feels a bit dishonest, incidentally,\nbecause you have to deliver these sentences as if you'd just thought\nof them.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nRobert Morris points out that there is a way in which practicing\ntalks makes them better: reading a talk out loud can expose awkward\nparts.  I agree and in fact I read most things I write out loud at\nleast once for that reason.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f4n\"><font color=\"#000000\">4</font></a>]\nFor sufficiently small audiences, it may not be true that being\npart of an audience makes people dumber.  The real decline seems\nto set in when the audience gets too big for the talk to feel like\na conversation — maybe around 10 people.<br/><br/>\n<b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman and Robert Morris for reading drafts\nof this.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2012-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
