{"href":"airbnb.html","title":"Subject: Airbnb","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">March 2011<br/><br/>Yesterday Fred Wilson published a remarkable <a href=\"http://avc.com/2011/03/airbnb\">post</a> about missing\n<a href=\"http://airbnb.com\">Airbnb</a>.   VCs miss good startups all the time, but it's extraordinarily\nrare for one to talk about it publicly till long afterward.  So\nthat post is further evidence what a rare bird Fred is.  He's\nprobably the nicest VC I know.<br/><br/>Reading Fred's post made me go back and look at the emails I exchanged\nwith him at the time, trying to convince him to invest in Airbnb.\nIt was quite interesting to read.  You can see Fred's mind at work \nas he circles the deal.<br/><br/>Fred and the Airbnb founders have generously agreed to let me publish\nthis email exchange (with one sentence redacted about something\nthat's strategically important to Airbnb and not an important part\nof the conversation).  It's an interesting illustration of an element\nof the startup ecosystem that few except the participants ever see:\ninvestors trying to convince one another to invest in their portfolio\ncompanies.  Hundreds if not thousands of conversations of this type\nare happening now, but if one has ever been published, I haven't\nseen it.  The Airbnbs themselves never even saw these emails at the\ntime.<br/><br/>We do a lot of this behind the scenes stuff at YC, because we invest\nin such a large number of companies, and we invest so early that\ninvestors sometimes need a lot of convincing to see their merits.\nI don't always try as hard as this though.  Fred must \nhave found me quite annoying.<br/><br/><br/><br/><hr/>\n<pre>\nfrom: Paul Graham\nto: Fred Wilson, AirBedAndBreakfast Founders\ndate: Fri, Jan 23, 2009 at 11:42 AM\nsubject: meet the airbeds<br/><br/>One of the startups from the batch that just started, AirbedAndBreakfast,\nis in NYC right now meeting their users.  (NYC is their biggest\nmarket.) I'd recommend meeting them if your schedule allows.<br/><br/>I'd been thinking to myself that though these guys were going to\ndo really well, I should introduce them to angels, because VCs would\nnever go for it.  But then I thought maybe I should give you more\ncredit.  You'll certainly like meeting them.  Be sure to ask about\nhow they funded themselves with breakfast cereal.<br/><br/>There's no reason this couldn't be as big as Ebay.  And this team\nis the right one to do it.<br/><br/>--pg<br/><br/><br/><br/>from: Brian Chesky\nto: Paul Graham\ncc: Nathan Blecharczyk, Joe Gebbia\ndate: Fri, Jan 23, 2009 at 11:40 AM\nsubject: Re: meet the airbeds<br/><br/>PG,<br/><br/>Thanks for the intro!<br/><br/>Brian<br/><br/><br/><br/>from: Paul Graham\nto: Brian Chesky\ncc: Nathan Blecharczyk, Joe Gebbia\ndate: Fri, Jan 23, 2009 at 12:38 PM\nsubject: Re: meet the airbeds<br/><br/>It's a longshot, at this stage, but if there was any VC who'd get\nyou guys, it would be Fred.
