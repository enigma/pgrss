{"href":"heroes.html","title":"Some Heroes","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">April 2008<br/><br/>There are some topics I save up because they'll be so much fun to\nwrite about.  This is one of them: a list of my heroes.<br/><br/>I'm not claiming this is a list of the <i>n</i> most admirable people.\nWho could make such a list, even if they wanted to?<br/><br/>Einstein isn't on the list, for example, even though he probably\ndeserves to be on any shortlist of admirable people.  I once asked\na physicist friend if Einstein was really as smart as his fame\nimplies, and she said that yes, he was.  So why isn't he on the\nlist?  Because I had to ask.  This is a list of people who've\ninfluenced me, not people who would have if I understood their work.<br/><br/>My test was to think of someone and ask \"is this person my\nhero?\"  It often returned surprising answers.  For example,\nit returned false for Montaigne, who was arguably the inventor of\nthe essay.  Why?  When I thought\nabout what it meant to call someone a hero, it meant I'd decide what\nto do by asking what they'd do in the same situation.  That's a \nstricter standard than admiration.<br/><br/>After I made the list, I looked to see if there was a pattern, and\nthere was, a very clear one.  Everyone on the list had two qualities:\nthey cared almost excessively about their work, and they were\nabsolutely honest.  By honest I don't mean trustworthy so much as\nthat they never pander: they never say or do something because\nthat's what the audience wants.  They are all fundamentally subversive\nfor this reason, though they conceal it to varying degrees.<br/><br/>\n<b>Jack Lambert</b><br/><br/>I grew up in Pittsburgh in the 1970s.  Unless you were there it's\nhard to imagine how that town felt about the Steelers.   Locally,\nall the news was bad.  The steel industry was dying.  But the\nSteelers were the best team in football â€” and moreover, in a\nway that seemed to reflect the personality of the city.  They didn't\ndo anything fancy.  They just got the job done.<br/><br/>Other players were more famous: Terry Bradshaw, Franco Harris, Lynn\nSwann.  But they played offense, and you always get more attention\nfor that.  It seemed to me as a twelve year old football expert\nthat the best of them all was \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Lambert_(American_football_player)\">Jack Lambert</a>.  And what made him so\ngood was that he was utterly relentless.  He didn't just care about\nplaying well; he cared almost too much.  He seemed to regard it as\na personal insult when someone from the other team had possession\nof the ball on his side of the line of scrimmage.<br/><br/>The suburbs of Pittsburgh in the 1970s were a pretty dull place.\nSchool was boring.  All the adults around were bored with their\njobs working for big companies. Everything that came to us through\nthe mass media was (a) blandly uniform and (b) produced elsewhere.\nJack Lambert was the exception.  He was like nothing else I'd seen.<br/><br/>\n<b>Kenneth Clark</b><br/><br/>Kenneth Clark is the best nonfiction writer I know of, on any\nsubject.  Most people who write about art history don't really like\nart; you can tell from a thousand little signs.  But Clark did, and\nnot just intellectually, but the way one anticipates a delicious\ndinner.<br/><br/>What really makes him stand out, though, is the quality of his\nideas.  His style is deceptively casual, but there is more in \nhis books than in a library\nof art monographs.  Reading \n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Nude-Study-Ideal-Form/dp/0691017883\"><i>The Nude</i></a> is like a ride in a\nFerrari.  Just as you're getting settled, you're slammed back in\nyour seat by the acceleration.  Before you can adjust, you're thrown\nsideways as the car screeches into the first turn.  His brain throws\noff ideas almost too fast to grasp them.  Finally at the end of the\nchapter you come to a halt, with your eyes wide and a big smile on\nyour face.<br/><br/>Kenneth Clark was a star in his day, thanks to the documentary\nseries \n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000F0UUKA\"><i>Civilisation</i></a>.  And if you read only one book about\nart history, \n<a href=\"http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?an=clark&amp;sts=t&amp;tn=civilisation\"><i>Civilisation</i></a> is the one I'd recommend.  It's\nmuch better than the drab Sears Catalogs of art that undergraduates\nare forced to buy for Art History 101.<br/><br/>\n<b>Larry Mihalko</b><br/><br/>A lot of people have a great teacher at some point in their childhood.\nLarry Mihalko was mine.  When I look back it's like there's a line\ndrawn between third and fourth grade.  After Mr. Mihalko, everything\nwas different.<br/><br/>Why?  First of all, he was intellectually curious.  I had a few\nother teachers who were smart, but I wouldn't describe them as\nintellectually curious.  In retrospect, he was out of place as an\nelementary school teacher, and I think he knew it.  That must have\nbeen hard for him, but it was wonderful for us, his students.  His\nclass was a constant adventure.  I used to like going to school\nevery day.<br/><br/>The other thing that made him different was that he liked us.  Kids\nare good at telling that.  The other teachers were at best benevolently\nindifferent.  But Mr.  Mihalko seemed like he actually wanted to\nbe our friend.  On the last day of fourth grade, he got out one of\nthe heavy school record players and played James Taylor's \"You've\nGot a Friend\" to us.  Just call out my name, and you know wherever\nI am, I'll come running.  He died at 59 of lung cancer.  I've never\ncried like I cried at his funeral.<br/><br/>\n<b>Leonardo</b><br/><br/>One of the things I've learned about making things that I didn't\nrealize when I was a kid is that much of the best stuff isn't made\nfor audiences, but for oneself.  You see paintings and drawings in\nmuseums and imagine they were made for you to look at.  Actually a\nlot of the best ones were made as a way of exploring the world, not\nas a way to please other people.  The best of these explorations\nare sometimes more pleasing than stuff made explicitly to please.<br/><br/>Leonardo did a lot of things.  One of his most admirable qualities\nwas that he did so many different things that were admirable.  What\npeople know of him now is his paintings and his more flamboyant\ninventions, like flying machines.  That makes him seem like some\nkind of dreamer who sketched artists' conceptions of rocket ships\non the side.  In fact he made a large number of far more practical\ntechnical discoveries.  He was as good an engineer as a painter.<br/><br/>His most impressive work, to me, is his \n<a href=\"https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/leonardo-skull.jpg?t=1688221954&amp;\">drawings</a>.  They're clearly\nmade more as a way of studying the world than producing something\nbeautiful. And yet they can hold their own with any work of art\never made.  No one else, before or since, was that good when no one\nwas looking.<br/><br/>\n<b>Robert Morris</b><br/><br/>Robert Morris has a very unusual quality: he's never wrong.  It\nmight seem this would require you to be omniscient, but actually\nit's surprisingly easy. Don't say anything unless you're fairly\nsure of it.  If you're not omniscient, you just don't end up saying\nmuch.<br/><br/>More precisely, the trick is to pay careful attention to how you\nqualify what you say.  By using this trick, Robert has, as far as\nI know, managed to be mistaken only once, and that was when he was\nan undergrad.  When the Mac came out, he said that little desktop\ncomputers would never be suitable for real hacking.<br/><br/>It's wrong to call it a trick in his case, though.  If it were a\nconscious trick, he would have slipped in a moment of excitement.\nWith Robert this quality is wired-in.  He has an almost superhuman\nintegrity.  He's not just generally correct, but also correct about\nhow correct he is.<br/><br/>You'd think it would be such a great thing never to be wrong that\neveryone would do this.  It doesn't seem like that much extra work\nto pay as much attention to the error on an idea as to the idea\nitself.  And yet practically no one does.  I know how hard it is,\nbecause since meeting Robert I've tried to do in software what he\nseems to do in hardware.<br/><br/>\n<b>P. G. Wodehouse</b><br/><br/>People are finally starting to admit that Wodehouse was a great\nwriter.  If you want to be thought a great novelist in your own\ntime, you have to sound intellectual.  If what you write is popular,\nor entertaining, or funny, you're ipso facto suspect.  That makes\nWodehouse doubly impressive, because it meant that to write as he\nwanted to, he had to commit to being despised in his own lifetime.<br/><br/>Evelyn Waugh called him a great writer, but to most people at the\ntime that would have read as a chivalrous or deliberately perverse\ngesture. At the time any random autobiographical novel by a recent\ncollege grad could count on more respectful treatment from the\nliterary establishment.<br/><br/>Wodehouse may have begun with simple atoms, but the way he composed\nthem into molecules was near faultless.  His rhythm in particular.\nIt makes me self-conscious to write about it.  I can think of only\ntwo other writers who came near him for style: Evelyn Waugh and\nNancy Mitford.  Those three used the English language like they\nowned it.<br/><br/>But Wodehouse has something neither of them did.  He's at ease.\nEvelyn Waugh and Nancy Mitford cared what other people thought of\nthem: he wanted to seem aristocratic; she was afraid she wasn't\nsmart enough.  But Wodehouse didn't give a damn what anyone thought\nof him.  He wrote exactly what he wanted.<br/><br/>\n<b>Alexander Calder</b><br/><br/>Calder's on this list because he makes me happy.  Can his work stand\nup to Leonardo's?  Probably not.  There might not be anything from\nthe 20th Century that can.  But what was good about Modernism,\nCalder had, and had in a way that he made seem effortless.<br/><br/>What was good about Modernism was its freshness.  Art became stuffy\nin the nineteenth century.  The paintings that were popular at the\ntime were mostly the art equivalent of McMansionsâ€”big,\npretentious, and fake.  Modernism meant starting over, making things\nwith the same earnest motives that children might.  The artists who\nbenefited most from this were the ones who had preserved a child's\nconfidence, like Klee and Calder.<br/><br/>Klee was impressive because he could work in so many different\nstyles.  But between the two I like Calder better, because his work\nseemed happier.  Ultimately the point of art is to engage the viewer.\nIt's hard to predict what will; often something that seems interesting\nat first will bore you after a month.  Calder's \n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/uergevich/7029234689/\">sculptures</a> never\nget boring.  They just sit there quietly radiating optimism, like\na battery that never runs out.  As far as I can tell from books and\nphotographs, the happiness of Calder's work is his own happiness\nshowing through.<br/><br/>\n<b>Jane Austen</b><br/><br/>Everyone admires Jane Austen.  Add my name to the list.  To me she\nseems the best novelist of all time.<br/><br/>I'm interested in how things work.  When I read most novels, I pay\nas much attention to the author's choices as to the story.  But in\nher novels I can't see the gears at work.  Though I'd really like\nto know how she does what she does, I can't figure it out, because\nshe's so good that her stories don't seem made up.  I feel like I'm\nreading a description of something that actually happened.<br/><br/>I used to read a lot of novels when I was younger.  I can't read\nmost anymore, because they don't have enough information in them.\nNovels seem so impoverished compared to history and biography.  But \nreading Austen is like reading\nnonfiction.  She writes so well you don't even notice her.<br/><br/>\n<b>John McCarthy</b><br/><br/>John McCarthy invented Lisp, the field of (or at least the term)\nartificial intelligence, and was an early member of both of the top\ntwo computer science departments, MIT and Stanford.  No one would\ndispute that he's one of the greats, but he's an especial hero to\nme because of \n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/rootsoflisp.html\">Lisp</a>.<br/><br/>It's hard for us now to understand what a conceptual leap that was\nat the time.  Paradoxically, one of the reasons his achievement is\nhard to appreciate is that it was so successful.  Practically every\nprogramming language invented in the last 20 years includes ideas\nfrom Lisp, and each year the median language gets more Lisplike.<br/><br/>In 1958 these ideas were anything but obvious.  In 1958 there seem\nto have been two ways of thinking about programming.  Some people\nthought of it as math, and proved things about Turing Machines.\nOthers thought of it as a way to get things done, and designed\nlanguages all too influenced by the technology of the day.  McCarthy\nalone bridged the gap.  He designed a language that was math.  But\ndesigned is not really the word; discovered is more like it.<br/><br/>\n<b>The Spitfire</b><br/><br/>As I was making this list I found myself thinking of people like\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Bader\">Douglas Bader</a> \nand \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._J._Mitchell\">R.J. Mitchell</a>\n and \n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Spitfire-Pilots-Story-Crecy-Cover/dp/0947554726\">Jeffrey Quill</a> and I realized\nthat though all of them had done many things in their lives, there\nwas one factor above all that connected them: the Spitfire.<br/><br/>This is supposed to be a list of heroes.  How can a machine be on\nit?  Because that machine was not just a machine.  It was a lens\nof heroes.  Extraordinary devotion went into it, and extraordinary\ncourage came out.<br/><br/>It's a cliche to call World War II a contest between good and evil,\nbut between fighter designs, it really was.  The Spitfire's original\nnemesis, the ME 109, was a brutally practical plane.  It was a\nkilling machine.  The Spitfire was optimism embodied.  And not just\nin its beautiful lines: it was at the edge of what could be\nmanufactured.  But taking the high road worked.  In the air, beauty\nhad the edge, just.<br/><br/>\n<b>Steve Jobs</b><br/><br/>People alive when Kennedy was killed  usually remember exactly where\nthey were when they heard about it.  I remember exactly where I was\nwhen a friend asked if I'd heard Steve Jobs had cancer.  It was\nlike the floor dropped out.   A few seconds later she told me that\nit was a rare operable type, and that he'd be ok.  But those seconds\nseemed long.<br/><br/>I wasn't sure whether to include Jobs on this list.  A lot of people\nat Apple seem to be afraid of him, which is a bad sign.  But he\ncompels admiration.<br/><br/>There's no name for what Steve Jobs is, because there hasn't been\nanyone quite like him before.  He doesn't design Apple's products\nhimself.  Historically the closest analogy to what he does are the\ngreat Renaissance patrons of the arts.  As the CEO of a company,\nthat makes him unique.<br/><br/>Most CEOs delegate \n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/taste.html\">taste</a> to a subordinate.\nThe \n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/gh.html\">design paradox</a>\n means they're choosing more or less at random.  But Steve\nJobs actually has taste himself â€” such good taste that he's shown\nthe world how much more important taste is than they realized.<br/><br/>\n<b>Isaac Newton</b><br/><br/>Newton has a strange role in my pantheon of heroes: he's the one I\nreproach myself with.  He worked on big things, at least for part\nof his life.  It's so easy to get distracted working on small stuff.\nThe questions you're answering are pleasantly familiar.  You get\nimmediate rewards â€” in fact, you get bigger rewards in your\ntime if you work on matters of passing importance.  But I'm\nuncomfortably aware that this is the route to well-deserved obscurity.<br/><br/>To do really great things, you have to seek out questions people\ndidn't even realize were questions.  There have probably been other\npeople who did this as well as Newton, for their time, but Newton\nis my model of this kind of thought.  I can just begin to understand\nwhat it must have felt like for him.<br/><br/>You only get one life.  Why not do something huge?  The phrase \"paradigm\nshift\" is overused now, but Kuhn was onto something.  And you know\nmore are out there, separated from us by what will later seem a\nsurprisingly thin wall of laziness and stupidity.  If we work like\nNewton.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and Jackie McDonough for reading drafts of this.<br/><br/></font>","date":"2008-04-01T00:00:00Z"}
