We probably spend more time\nthinking about it than most, because we invest the earliest.\nPrediction is usually all we have to rely on.<br/><br/>We learned quickly that the most important predictor of success is\ndetermination.  At first we thought it might be intelligence.\nEveryone likes to believe that's what makes startups succeed.  It\nmakes a better story that a company won because its founders were\nso smart.  The PR people and reporters who spread such stories\nprobably believe them themselves.  But while it certainly helps to\nbe smart, it's not the deciding factor.  There are plenty of people\nas smart as Bill Gates who achieve nothing.<br/><br/>In most domains, talent is overrated compared to determinationâ€”partly\nbecause it makes a better story, partly because it gives onlookers\nan excuse for being lazy, and partly because after a while determination\nstarts to look like talent.<br/><br/>I can't think of any field in which determination is overrated, but\nthe relative importance of determination and talent probably do\nvary somewhat.  Talent probably matters more in types of work that\nare purer, in the sense that one is solving mostly a single type\nof problem instead of many different types.   I suspect determination\nwould not take you as far in math as it would in, say, organized\ncrime.<br/><br/>I don't mean to suggest by this comparison that types of work that\ndepend more on talent are always more admirable.  Most people would\nagree it's more admirable to be good at math than memorizing long\nstrings of digits, even though the latter depends more on natural\nability.<br/><br/>Perhaps one reason people believe startup founders win by being\nsmarter is that intelligence does matter more in technology startups\nthan it used to in earlier types of companies.  You probably do\nneed to be a bit smarter to dominate Internet search than you had\nto be to dominate railroads or hotels or newspapers.  And that's\nprobably an ongoing trend.  But even in the highest of high tech\nindustries, success still depends more on determination than brains.<br/><br/>If determination is so important, can we isolate its components?\nAre some more important than others?  Are there some you can\ncultivate?<br/><br/>The simplest form of determination is sheer willfulness.  When you\nwant something, you must have it, no matter what.<br/><br/>A good deal of willfulness must be inborn, because it's common to\nsee families where one sibling has much more of it than another.\nCircumstances can alter it, but at the high end of the scale, nature\nseems to be more important than nurture.  Bad circumstances can\nbreak the spirit of a strong-willed person, but I don't think there's\nmuch you can do to make a weak-willed person stronger-willed.<br/><br/>Being strong-willed is not enough, however.  You also have to be\nhard on yourself.  Someone who was strong-willed but self-indulgent\nwould not be called determined.  Determination implies your willfulness\nis balanced by discipline.<br/><br/>That word balance is a significant one.  The more willful you are,\nthe more disciplined you have to be.  The stronger your will, the\nless anyone will be able to argue with you except yourself.  And\nsomeone has to argue with you, because everyone has base impulses,\nand if you have more will than discipline you'll just give into\nthem and end up on a local maximum like drug addiction.<br/><br/>We can imagine will and discipline as two fingers squeezing a\nslippery melon seed.  The harder they squeeze, the further the seed\nflies, but they must both squeeze equally or the seed spins off\nsideways.<br/><br/>If this is true it has interesting implications, because discipline\ncan be cultivated, and in fact does tend to vary quite a lot in the\ncourse of an individual's life.  If determination is effectively\nthe product of will and discipline, then you can become more\ndetermined by being more disciplined.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/determination.html#f1n\"><font color=\"#999999\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Another consequence of the melon seed model is that the more willful\nyou are, the more dangerous it is to be undisciplined.  There seem\nto be plenty of examples to confirm that.  In some very energetic\npeople's lives you see something like wing flutter, where they\nalternate between doing great work and doing absolutely nothing.\nExternally this would look a lot like bipolar disorder.<br/><br/>The melon seed model is inaccurate in at least one respect, however:\nit's static.  In fact the dangers of indiscipline increase with\ntemptation.  Which means, interestingly, that determination tends\nto erode itself.  If you're sufficiently determined to achieve great\nthings, this will probably increase the number of temptations around\nyou.  Unless you become proportionally more disciplined, willfulness\nwill then get the upper hand, and your achievement will revert to\nthe mean.<br/><br/>That's why Shakespeare's Caesar thought thin men so dangerous.  They weren't\ntempted by the minor perquisites of power.<br/><br/>The melon seed model implies it's possible to be too disciplined.\nIs it?  I think there probably are people whose willfulness is\ncrushed down by excessive discipline, and who would achieve more\nif they weren't so hard on themselves.  One reason the young sometimes\nsucceed where the old fail is that they don't realize how incompetent\nthey are.  This lets them do a kind of deficit spending.  When they\nfirst start working on something, they overrate their achievements.\nBut that gives them confidence to keep working, and their performance\nimproves.  Whereas someone clearer-eyed would see their initial\nincompetence for what it was, and perhaps be discouraged from\ncontinuing.<br/><br/>There's one other major component of determination: ambition.  If\nwillfulness and discipline are what get you to your destination,\nambition is how you choose it.<br/><br/>I don't know if it's exactly right to say that ambition is a component\nof determination, but they're not entirely orthogonal.  It would\nseem a misnomer if someone said they were very determined to do\nsomething trivially easy.<br/><br/>And fortunately ambition seems to be quite malleable; there's a lot\nyou can do to increase it.  Most people don't know how ambitious\nto be, especially when they're young.  They don't know what's hard,\nor what they're capable of.  And this problem is exacerbated by\nhaving few peers.  Ambitious people are rare, so if everyone is\nmixed together randomly, as they tend to be early in people's lives,\nthen the ambitious ones won't have many ambitious peers.  When you\ntake people like this and put them together with other ambitious\npeople, they bloom like dying plants given water.  Probably most\nambitious people are starved for the sort of encouragement they'd\nget from ambitious peers, whatever their age.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/determination.html#f2n\"><font color=\"#999999\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Achievements also tend to increase your ambition.  With each step\nyou gain confidence to stretch further next time.<br/><br/>So here in sum is how determination seems to work: it consists of\nwillfulness balanced with discipline, aimed by ambition.   And\nfortunately at least two of these three qualities can be cultivated.\nYou may be able to increase your strength of will somewhat; you can\ndefinitely learn self-discipline; and almost everyone is practically\nmalnourished when it comes to ambition.<br/><br/>I feel like I understand determination a bit better now.  But only\na bit: willfulness, discipline, and ambition are all concepts almost\nas complicated as determination.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/determination.html#f3n\"><font color=\"#999999\">3</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Note too that determination and talent are not the whole story.\nThere's a third factor in achievement: how much you like the work.\nIf you really <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/love.html\">love</a> working on something,\nyou don't need determination to drive you; it's what you'd do anyway.\nBut most types of work have aspects one doesn't like, because most\ntypes of work consist of doing things for other people, and it's\nvery unlikely that the tasks imposed by their needs will happen to\nalign exactly with what you want to do.<br/><br/>Indeed, if you want to create the most <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/wealth.html\">wealth</a>,\nthe way to do it is to focus more on their needs than your interests,\nand make up the difference with determination.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nLoosely speaking.  What I'm claiming with the melon seed model\nis more like determination is proportionate to wd^m - k|w - d|^n,\nwhere w is will and d discipline.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nWhich means one of the best ways to help a society generally\nis to create <a href=\"http://startupschool.org\">events</a> and <a href=\"http://ycombinator.com\">institutions</a> that bring ambitious\npeople together.  It's like pulling the control rods out of a\nreactor: the energy they emit encourages other ambitious people,\ninstead of being absorbed by the normal people they're usually\nsurrounded with.<br/><br/>Conversely, it's probably a mistake to do as some European countries\nhave done and try to ensure none of your universities is significantly\nbetter than the others.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nFor example, willfulness clearly has two subcomponents,\nstubbornness and energy.  The first alone yields someone who's\nstubbornly inert.  The second alone yields someone flighty.\nAs willful people get older or otherwise lose their energy, they\ntend to become merely stubborn.<br/><br/>\n<b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris\nfor reading drafts of this.<br/><br/></br></p></font>","date":"2009-09-01T00:00:00Z"}
