But\nthere are three different reasons people might not know something,\nand they yield three very different kinds of essays.<br/><br/>One reason people won't know something is if it's not important to\nknow. That doesn't mean it will make a bad essay. For example, you\nmight write a good essay about a particular model of car. Readers\nwould learn something from it. It would add to their picture of the\nworld. For a handful of readers it might even spur some kind of\nepiphany. But unless this is a very unusual car it's not critical\nfor everyone to know about it. \n<font color=\"#dddddd\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/field.html#f1n\"><font color=\"#dddddd\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>If something isn't important to know, there's no answer to the\nquestion of why people don't know it. Not knowing random facts is\nthe default. But if you're going to write about things that <i>are</i>\nimportant to know, you have to ask why your readers don't already\nknow them. Is it because they're smart but inexperienced, or because\nthey're obtuse?<br/><br/>So the three reasons readers might not already know what you tell\nthem are (a) that it's not important, (b) that they're obtuse, \nor (c) that they're inexperienced.<br/><br/>The reason I did this breakdown was to get at the following fact,\nwhich might have seemed controversial if I'd led with it, but should\nbe obvious now. If you're writing for smart people about important\nthings, you're writing for the young.<br/><br/>Or more precisely, that's where you'll have the most effect. Whatever\nyou say should also be at least somewhat novel to you, however old\nyou are. It's not an essay otherwise, because an essay is something\nyou write to figure something out. But whatever you figure out will\npresumably be more of a surprise to younger readers than it is to\nyou.<br/><br/>There's a continuum of surprise. At one extreme, something you read\ncan change your whole way of thinking. <i>The Selfish Gene</i> did this\nto me. It was like suddenly seeing the other interpretation of an\nambiguous image: you can treat genes rather than organisms as the\nprotagonists, and evolution becomes easier to understand when you\ndo. At the other extreme, writing merely puts into words something\nreaders were already thinking â€” or thought they were.<br/><br/>The impact of an essay is how much it changes readers' thinking\nmultiplied by the importance of the topic. But it's hard to do well\nat both. It's hard to have big new ideas about important topics.\nSo in practice there's a tradeoff: you can change readers' thinking\na lot about moderately important things, or change it a little about\nvery important ones. But with younger readers the tradeoff shifts.\nThere's more room to change their thinking, so there's a bigger\npayoff for writing about important things.<br/><br/>The tradeoff isn't a conscious one, at least not for me. It's more\nlike a kind of gravitational field that writers work in. But every\nessayist works in it, whether they realize it or not.<br/><br/>This seems obvious once you state it, but it took me a long time\nto understand. I knew I wanted to write for smart people about\nimportant topics. I noticed empirically that I seemed to be writing\nfor the young. But it took me years to understand that the latter\nwas an automatic consequence of the former. In fact I only really\nfigured it out as I was writing this essay.<br/><br/>Now that I know it, should I change anything? I don't think so. In\nfact seeing the shape of the field that writers work in has reminded\nme that I'm not optimizing for returns in it. I'm not trying to\nsurprise readers of any particular age; I'm trying to surprise\nmyself.<br/><br/>The way I usually decide what to write about is by following\ncuriosity. I notice something new and dig into it. It would probably\nbe a mistake to change that. But seeing the shape of the essay field\nhas set me thinking. What would surprise young readers? Which\nimportant things do people tend to learn late? Interesting question.\nI should think about that.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Note</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nIt's hard to write a really good essay about an unimportant\ntopic, though, because a really good essayist will inevitably draw\nthe topic into deeper waters. E. B. White could write an essay about\nhow to boil potatoes that ended up being full of timeless wisdom.\nIn which case, of course, it wouldn't really be about how to boil\npotatoes; that would just have been the starting point.<br/><br/><br/><br/><font color=\"888888\"><b>Thanks</b> to Jessica Livingston and Michael \nNielsen for reading drafts of this.</font><br/><br/></font>","date":"2025-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
