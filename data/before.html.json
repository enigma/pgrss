It's intended for college students, but much of it is\napplicable to potential founders at other ages.)</i><br/><br/>One of the advantages of having kids is that when you have to give\nadvice, you can ask yourself \"what would I tell my own kids?\"  My\nkids are little, but I can imagine what I'd tell them about startups\nif they were in college, and that's what I'm going to tell you.<br/><br/>Startups are very counterintuitive.  I'm not sure why.  Maybe it's\njust because knowledge about them hasn't permeated our culture yet.\nBut whatever the reason, starting a startup is a task where you\ncan't always trust your instincts.<br/><br/>It's like skiing in that way.  When you first try skiing and you\nwant to slow down, your instinct is to lean back.  But if you lean\nback on skis you fly down the hill out of control.  So part of\nlearning to ski is learning to suppress that impulse.  Eventually\nyou get new habits, but at first it takes a conscious effort.  At\nfirst there's a list of things you're trying to remember as you\nstart down the hill.<br/><br/>Startups are as unnatural as skiing, so there's a similar list for\nstartups. Here I'm going to give you the first part of it — the things\nto remember if you want to prepare yourself to start a startup.<br/><br/>\n<b>Counterintuitive</b><br/><br/>The first item on it is the fact I already mentioned: that startups\nare so weird that if you trust your instincts, you'll make a lot\nof mistakes.  If you know nothing more than this, you may at least\npause before making them.<br/><br/>When I was running Y Combinator I used to joke that our function\nwas to tell founders things they would ignore.  It's really true.\nBatch after batch, the YC partners warn founders about mistakes\nthey're about to make, and the founders ignore them, and then come\nback a year later and say \"I wish we'd listened.\"<br/><br/>Why do the founders ignore the partners' advice?  Well, that's the\nthing about counterintuitive ideas: they contradict your intuitions.\nThey seem wrong.  So of course your first impulse is to disregard\nthem.  And in fact my joking description is not merely the curse\nof Y Combinator but part of its raison d'etre. If founders' instincts\nalready gave them the right answers, they wouldn't need us.  You\nonly need other people to give you advice that surprises you. That's\nwhy there are a lot of ski instructors and not many running\ninstructors.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/before.html#f1n\"><font color=\"#999999\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>You can, however, trust your instincts about people.  And in fact\none of the most common mistakes young founders make is not to\ndo that enough.  They get involved with people who seem impressive,\nbut about whom they feel some misgivings personally.  Later when\nthings blow up they say \"I knew there was something off about him,\nbut I ignored it because he seemed so impressive.\"<br/><br/>If you're thinking about getting involved with someone — as a\ncofounder, an employee, an investor, or an acquirer — and you\nhave misgivings about them, trust your gut.  If someone seems\nslippery, or bogus, or a jerk, don't ignore it.<br/><br/>This is one case where it pays to be self-indulgent. Work with\npeople you genuinely like, and you've known long enough to be sure.<br/><br/>\n<b>Expertise</b><br/><br/>The second counterintuitive point is that it's not that important\nto know a lot about startups.  The way to succeed in a startup is\nnot to be an expert on startups, but to be an expert on your users\nand the problem you're solving for them.\nMark Zuckerberg didn't succeed because he was an expert on startups.\nHe succeeded despite being a complete noob at startups, because he\nunderstood his users really well.<br/><br/>If you don't know anything about, say, how to raise an angel round,\ndon't feel bad on that account.  That sort of thing you can learn\nwhen you need to, and forget after you've done it.<br/><br/>In fact, I worry it's not merely unnecessary to learn in great\ndetail about the mechanics of startups, but possibly somewhat\ndangerous.  If I met an undergrad who knew all about convertible\nnotes and employee agreements and (God forbid) class FF stock, I\nwouldn't think \"here is someone who is way ahead of their peers.\"\nIt would set off alarms.  Because another of the characteristic\nmistakes of young founders is to go through the motions of starting\na startup.  They make up some plausible-sounding idea, raise money\nat a good valuation, rent a cool office, hire a bunch of people.\nFrom the outside that seems like what startups do.  But the next\nstep after rent a cool office and hire a bunch of people is: gradually\nrealize how completely fucked they are, because while imitating all\nthe outward forms of a startup they have neglected the one thing\nthat's actually essential: making something people want.<br/><br/>\n<b>Game</b><br/><br/>We saw this happen so often that we made up a name for it: playing\nhouse.  Eventually I realized why it was happening.  The reason\nyoung founders go through the motions of starting a startup is\nbecause that's what they've been trained to do for their whole lives\nup to that point.  Think about what you have to do to get into\ncollege, for example.  Extracurricular activities, check.  Even in\ncollege classes most of the work is as artificial as running laps.<br/><br/>I'm not attacking the educational system for being this way. There\nwill always be a certain amount of fakeness in the work you do when\nyou're being taught something, and if you measure their performance\nit's inevitable that people will exploit the difference to the point\nwhere much of what you're measuring is artifacts of the fakeness.<br/><br/>I confess I did it myself in college. I found that in a lot of\nclasses there might only be 20 or 30 ideas that were the right shape\nto make good exam questions.  The way I studied for exams in these\nclasses was not (except incidentally) to master the material taught\nin the class, but to make a list of potential exam questions and\nwork out the answers in advance. When I walked into the final, the\nmain thing I'd be feeling was curiosity about which of my questions\nwould turn up on the exam.  It was like a game.<br/><br/>It's not surprising that after being trained for their whole lives\nto play such games, young founders' first impulse on starting a\nstartup is to try to figure out the tricks for winning at this new\ngame. Since fundraising appears to be the measure of success for\nstartups (another classic noob mistake), they always want to know what the\ntricks are for convincing investors.  We tell them the best way to\n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/convince.html\">convince investors</a> is to make a startup\nthat's actually doing well, meaning <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/growth.html\">growing fast</a>, and then simply\ntell investors so.  Then they want to know what the tricks are for\ngrowing fast.  And we have to tell them the best way to do that is\nsimply to make something people want.<br/><br/>So many of the conversations YC partners have with young founders\nbegin with the founder asking \"How do we...\" and the partner replying\n\"Just...\"<br/><br/>Why do the founders always make things so complicated?  The reason,\nI realized, is that they're looking for the trick.<br/><br/>So this is the third counterintuitive thing to remember about\nstartups: starting a startup is where gaming the system stops\nworking.  Gaming the system may continue to work if you go to work\nfor a big company. Depending on how broken the company is, you can\nsucceed by sucking up to the right people, giving the impression\nof productivity, and so on. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/before.html#f2n\"><font color=\"#999999\">2</font></a>]</font>\nBut that doesn't work with startups.\nThere is no boss to trick, only users, and all users care about is\nwhether your product does what they want. Startups are as impersonal\nas physics.  You have to make something people want, and you prosper\nonly to the extent you do.<br/><br/>The dangerous thing is, faking does work to some degree on investors.\nIf you're super good at sounding like you know what you're talking\nabout, you can fool investors for at least one and perhaps even two\nrounds of funding.  But it's not in your interest to.  The company\nis ultimately doomed.  All you're doing is wasting your own time\nriding it down.<br/><br/>So stop looking for the trick. There are tricks in startups, as\nthere are in any domain, but they are an order of magnitude less\nimportant than solving the real problem. A founder who knows nothing\nabout fundraising but has made something users love will have an\neasier time raising money than one who knows every trick in the\nbook but has a flat usage graph. And more importantly, the founder\nwho has made something users love is the one who will go on to\nsucceed after raising the money.<br/><br/>Though in a sense it's bad news in that you're deprived of one of\nyour most powerful weapons, I think it's exciting that gaming the\nsystem stops working when you start a startup.  It's exciting that\nthere even exist parts of the world where you win by doing good\nwork.  Imagine how depressing the world would be if it were all\nlike school and big companies, where you either have to spend a lot\nof time on bullshit things or lose to people who do.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/before.html#f3n\"><font color=\"#999999\">3</font></a>]</font>\nI would\nhave been delighted if I'd realized in college that there were parts\nof the real world where gaming the system mattered less than others,\nand a few where it hardly mattered at all.  But there are, and this\nvariation is one of the most important things to consider when\nyou're thinking about your future.  How do you win in each type of\nwork, and what would you like to win by doing?\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/before.html#f4n\"><font color=\"#999999\">4</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>\n<b>All-Consuming</b><br/><br/>That brings us to our fourth counterintuitive point: startups are\nall-consuming.  If you start a startup, it will take over your life\nto a degree you cannot imagine.  And if your startup succeeds, it\nwill take over your life for a long time: for several years at the\nvery least, maybe for a decade, maybe for the rest of your working\nlife.  So there is a real opportunity cost here.<br/><br/>Larry Page may seem to have an enviable life, but there are aspects\nof it that are unenviable.  Basically at 25 he started running as\nfast as he could and it must seem to him that he hasn't stopped to\ncatch his breath since.  Every day new shit happens in the Google\nempire that only the CEO can deal with, and he, as CEO, has to deal\nwith it.  If he goes on vacation for even a week, a whole week's\nbacklog of shit accumulates.  And he has to bear this uncomplainingly,\npartly because as the company's daddy he can never show fear or\nweakness, and partly because billionaires get less than zero sympathy\nif they talk about having difficult lives.  Which has the strange\nside effect that the difficulty of being a successful startup founder\nis concealed from almost everyone except those who've done it.<br/><br/>Y Combinator has now funded several companies that can be called\nbig successes, and in every single case the founders say the same\nthing.  It never gets any easier.  The nature of the problems change.\nYou're worrying about construction delays at your London office\ninstead of the broken air conditioner in your studio apartment.\nBut the total volume of worry never decreases; if anything it\nincreases.<br/><br/>Starting a successful startup is similar to having kids in that\nit's like a button you push that changes your life irrevocably.\nAnd while it's truly wonderful having kids, there are a lot of\nthings that are easier to do before you have them than after.  Many\nof which will make you a better parent when you do have kids. And\nsince you can delay pushing the button for a while, most people in\nrich countries do.<br/><br/>Yet when it comes to startups, a lot of people seem to think they're\nsupposed to start them while they're still in college.  Are you\ncrazy?  And what are the universities thinking?  They go out of\ntheir way to ensure their students are well supplied with contraceptives,\nand yet they're setting up entrepreneurship programs and startup\nincubators left and right.<br/><br/>To be fair, the universities have their hand forced here.  A lot\nof incoming students are interested in startups.  Universities are,\nat least de facto, expected to prepare them for their careers.  So\nstudents who want to start startups hope universities can teach\nthem about startups.  And whether universities can do this or not,\nthere's some pressure to claim they can, lest they lose applicants\nto other universities that do.<br/><br/>Can universities teach students about startups?  Yes and no.  They\ncan teach students about startups, but as I explained before, this\nis not what you need to know.  What you need to learn about are the\nneeds of your own users, and you can't do that until you actually\nstart the company.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/before.html#f5n\"><font color=\"#999999\">5</font></a>]</font>\nSo starting a startup is intrinsically\nsomething you can only really learn by doing it.  And it's impossible\nto do that in college, for the reason I just explained: startups\ntake over your life.  You can't start a startup for real as a\nstudent, because if you start a startup for real you're not a student\nanymore. You may be nominally a student for a bit, but you won't even\nbe that for long.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/before.html#f6n\"><font color=\"#999999\">6</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Given this dichotomy, which of the two paths should you take?  Be\na real student and not start a startup, or start a real startup and\nnot be a student?  I can answer that one for you. Do not start a\nstartup in college.  How to start a startup is just a subset of a\nbigger problem you're trying to solve: how to have a good life.\nAnd though starting a startup can be part of a good life for a lot\nof ambitious people, age 20 is not the optimal time to do it.\nStarting a startup is like a brutally fast depth-first search.  Most\npeople should still be searching breadth-first at 20.<br/><br/>You can do things in your early 20s that you can't do as well before\nor after, like plunge deeply into projects on a whim and travel\nsuper cheaply with no sense of a deadline.  For unambitious people,\nthis sort of thing is the dreaded \"failure to launch,\" but for the\nambitious ones it can be an incomparably valuable sort of exploration.\nIf you start a startup at 20 and you're sufficiently successful,\nyou'll never get to do it.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/before.html#f7n\"><font color=\"#999999\">7</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Mark Zuckerberg will never get to bum around a foreign country.  He\ncan do other things most people can't, like charter jets to fly him\nto foreign countries. But success has taken a lot of the serendipity\nout of his life. Facebook is running him as much as he's running\nFacebook. And while it can be very cool to be in the grip of a\nproject you consider your life's work, there are advantages to\nserendipity too, especially early in life.  Among other things it\ngives you more options to choose your life's work from.<br/><br/>There's not even a tradeoff here. You're not sacrificing anything\nif you forgo starting a startup at 20, because you're more likely\nto succeed if you wait.  In the unlikely case that you're 20 and\none of your side projects takes off like Facebook did, you'll face\na choice of running with it or not, and it may be reasonable to run\nwith it.  But the usual way startups take off is for the founders\nto <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/ds.html\">make them</a> take off, and it's gratuitously\nstupid to do that at 20.<br/><br/>\n<b>Try</b><br/><br/>Should you do it at any age?  I realize I've made startups sound\npretty hard.  If I haven't, let me try again: starting a startup\nis really hard.  What if it's too hard?  How can you tell if you're\nup to this challenge?<br/><br/>The answer is the fifth counterintuitive point: you can't tell. Your\nlife so far may have given you some idea what your prospects might\nbe if you tried to become a mathematician, or a professional football\nplayer.  But unless you've had a very strange life you haven't done\nmuch that was <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/really.html\">like</a> being a startup founder.\nStarting a startup will change you a lot.  So what you're trying\nto estimate is not just what you are, but what you could grow into,\nand who can do that?<br/><br/>For the past 9 years it was my job to predict whether people would\nhave what it took to start successful startups.  It was easy to\ntell how smart they were, and most people reading this will be over\nthat threshold.  The hard part was predicting how tough and ambitious they would become.  There\nmay be no one who has more experience at trying to predict that,\nso I can tell you how much an expert can know about it, and the\nanswer is: not much.  I learned to keep a completely open mind about\nwhich of the startups in each batch would turn out to be the stars.<br/><br/>The founders sometimes think they know. Some arrive feeling sure\nthey will ace Y Combinator just as they've aced every one of the (few,\nartificial, easy) tests they've faced in life so far.  Others arrive\nwondering how they got in, and hoping YC doesn't discover whatever\nmistake caused it to accept them.  But there is little correlation\nbetween founders' initial attitudes and how well their companies\ndo.<br/><br/>I've read that the same is true in the military — that the\nswaggering recruits are no more likely to turn out to be really\ntough than the quiet ones. And probably for the same reason: that\nthe tests involved are so different from the ones in their previous\nlives.<br/><br/>If you're absolutely terrified of starting a startup, you probably\nshouldn't do it.  But if you're merely unsure whether you're up to\nit, the only way to find out is to try.  Just not now.<br/><br/>\n<b>Ideas</b><br/><br/>So if you want to start a startup one day, what should you do in\ncollege?  There are only two things you need initially: an idea and\ncofounders.  And the m.o. for getting both is the same.  Which leads\nto our sixth and last counterintuitive point: that the way to get\nstartup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas.<br/><br/>I've written a whole <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html\">essay</a> on this,\nso I won't repeat it all here.  But the short version is that if\nyou make a conscious effort to think of startup ideas, the ideas\nyou come up with will not merely be bad, but bad and plausible-sounding,\nmeaning you'll waste a lot of time on them before realizing they're\nbad.<br/><br/>The way to come up with good startup ideas is to take a step back.\nInstead of making a conscious effort to think of startup ideas,\nturn your mind into the type that startup ideas form in without any\nconscious effort.  In fact, so unconsciously that you don't even\nrealize at first that they're startup ideas.<br/><br/>This is not only possible, it's how Apple, Yahoo, Google, and\nFacebook all got started.  None of these companies were even meant\nto be companies at first.  They were all just side projects.  The\nbest startups almost have to start as side projects, because great\nideas tend to be such outliers that your conscious mind would reject\nthem as ideas for companies.<br/><br/>Ok, so how do you turn your mind into the type that startup ideas\nform in unconsciously?  (1) Learn a lot about things that matter,\nthen (2) work on problems that interest you (3) with people you\nlike and respect.  The third part, incidentally, is how you get\ncofounders at the same time as the idea.<br/><br/>The first time I wrote that paragraph, instead of \"learn a lot about\nthings that matter,\" I wrote \"become good at some technology.\" But\nthat prescription, though sufficient, is too narrow.  What was\nspecial about Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia was not that they were\nexperts in technology.  They were good at design, and perhaps even\nmore importantly, they were good at organizing groups and making\nprojects happen.  So you don't have to work on technology per se,\nso long as you work on problems demanding enough to stretch you.<br/><br/>What kind of problems are those?  That is very hard to answer in\nthe general case.  History is full of examples of young people who\nwere working on important problems that <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/marginal.html\">no\none else</a> at the time thought were important, and in particular\nthat their parents didn't think were important.  On the other hand,\nhistory is even fuller of examples of parents who thought their\nkids were wasting their time and who were right.  So how do you\nknow when you're working on real stuff?\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/before.html#f8n\"><font color=\"#999999\">8</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>I know how <i>I</i> know.  Real problems are interesting, and I am\nself-indulgent in the sense that I always want to work on interesting\nthings, even if no one else cares about them (in fact, especially\nif no one else cares about them), and find it very hard to make\nmyself work on boring things, even if they're supposed to be\nimportant.<br/><br/>My life is full of case after case where I worked on something just\nbecause it seemed interesting, and it turned out later to be useful\nin some worldly way.  <a href=\"http://ycombinator.com/start.html\">Y\nCombinator itself</a> was something I only did because it seemed\ninteresting. So I seem to have some sort of internal compass that\nhelps me out.  But I don't know what other people have in their\nheads. Maybe if I think more about this I can come up with heuristics\nfor recognizing genuinely interesting problems, but for the moment\nthe best I can offer is the hopelessly question-begging advice that\nif you have a taste for genuinely interesting problems, indulging\nit energetically is the best way to prepare yourself for a startup.\nAnd indeed, probably also the best way to live.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/before.html#f9n\"><font color=\"#999999\">9</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>But although I can't explain in the general case what counts as an\ninteresting problem, I can tell you about a large subset of them.\nIf you think of technology as something that's spreading like a\nsort of fractal stain, every moving point on the edge represents\nan interesting problem.  So one guaranteed way to turn your mind\ninto the type that has good startup ideas is to get yourself to the\nleading edge of some technology — to cause yourself, as Paul\nBuchheit put it, to \"live in the future.\" When you reach that point,\nideas that will seem to other people uncannily prescient will seem\nobvious to you.  You may not realize they're startup ideas, but\nyou'll know they're something that ought to exist.<br/><br/>For example, back at Harvard in the mid 90s a fellow grad student\nof my friends Robert and Trevor wrote his own voice over IP software.\nHe didn't mean it to be a startup, and he never tried to turn it\ninto one.  He just wanted to talk to his girlfriend in Taiwan without\npaying for long distance calls, and since he was an expert on\nnetworks it seemed obvious to him that the way to do it was turn\nthe sound into packets and ship it over the Internet. He never did\nany more with his software than talk to his girlfriend, but this\nis exactly the way the best startups get started.<br/><br/>So strangely enough the optimal thing to do in college if you want\nto be a successful startup founder is not some sort of new, vocational\nversion of college focused on \"entrepreneurship.\" It's the classic\nversion of college as education for its own sake. If you want to\nstart a startup after college, what you should do in college is\nlearn powerful things.  And if you have genuine intellectual\ncuriosity, that's what you'll naturally tend to do if you just\nfollow your own inclinations.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/before.html#f10n\"><font color=\"#999999\">10</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>The component of entrepreneurship that really matters is domain\nexpertise.  The way to become Larry Page was to become an expert\non search. And the way to become an expert on search was to be\ndriven by genuine curiosity, not some ulterior motive.<br/><br/>At its best, starting a startup is merely an ulterior motive for\ncuriosity.  And you'll do it best if you introduce the ulterior\nmotive toward the end of the process.<br/><br/>So here is the ultimate advice for young would-be startup founders,\nboiled down to two words: just learn.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nSome founders listen more than others, and this tends to be a\n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/word.html\">predictor of success</a>. One of the things I\nremember about the Airbnbs during YC is how intently they listened.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nIn fact, this is one of the reasons startups are possible.  If\nbig companies weren't plagued by internal inefficiencies, they'd\nbe proportionately more effective, leaving less room for startups.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nIn a startup you have to spend a lot of time on <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/schlep.html\">schleps</a>, but this sort of work is merely\nunglamorous, not bogus.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f4n\"><font color=\"#000000\">4</font></a>]\nWhat should you do if your true calling is gaming the system?\nManagement consulting.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f5n\"><font color=\"#000000\">5</font></a>]\nThe company may not be incorporated, but if you start to get\nsignificant numbers of users, you've started it, whether you realize\nit yet or not.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f6n\"><font color=\"#000000\">6</font></a>]\nIt shouldn't be that surprising that colleges can't teach\nstudents how to be good startup founders, because they can't teach\nthem how to be good employees either.<br/><br/>The way universities \"teach\" students how to be employees is to\nhand off the task to companies via internship programs.  But you\ncouldn't do the equivalent thing for startups, because by definition\nif the students did well they would never come back.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f7n\"><font color=\"#000000\">7</font></a>]\nCharles Darwin was 22 when he received an invitation to travel\naboard the HMS Beagle as a naturalist.

And yet if he hadn't we probably would not know\nhis name.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f8n\"><font color=\"#000000\">8</font></a>]\nParents can sometimes be especially conservative in this\ndepartment.  There are some whose definition of important problems\nincludes only those on the critical path to med school.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f9n\"><font color=\"#000000\">9</font></a>]\nI did manage to think of a heuristic for detecting whether you\nhave a taste for interesting ideas: whether you find known boring\nideas intolerable.  Could you endure studying literary theory, or\nworking in middle management at a large company?<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f10n\"><font color=\"#000000\">10</font></a>]\nIn fact, if your goal is to start a startup, you can stick\neven more closely to the ideal of a liberal education than past\ngenerations have. Back when students focused mainly on getting a\njob after college, they thought at least a little about how the\ncourses they took might look to an employer.  And perhaps even\nworse, they might shy away from taking a difficult class lest they\nget a low grade, which would harm their all-important GPA.  Good\nnews: users <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/credentials.html\">don't care</a> what your GPA\nwas.  And I've never heard of investors caring either.  Y Combinator\ncertainly never asks what classes you took in college or what grades\nyou got in them.<br/><br/>\n<b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, John Collison, Patrick\nCollison, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, Geoff Ralston, and\nFred Wilson for reading drafts of this.<br/><br/></br></p></font>","date":"2014-10-01T00:00:00Z"}
