Well, we humans are\nas conspicuously different from other animals as the anteater.\nIn our case the distinguishing feature is the ability to reason.\nSo obviously that is what we should be doing, and a human who\ndoesn't is doing a bad job of being human — is no better than an\nanimal.\n</blockquote>\nNow we'd give a different answer.  At least, someone Socrates's age\nwould.  We'd ask why we even suppose we have a \"purpose\" in life.\nWe may be better adapted for some things than others; we\nmay be happier doing things we're adapted for; but why assume\npurpose?<br/><br/>The history of ideas\nis a history of gradually discarding the assumption that it's all\nabout us.  No, it turns out, the earth is not the center of the\nuniverse — not even the center of the solar system.  No, it turns\nout, humans are not created by God in his own image; they're just\none species among many, descended not merely from apes, but from\nmicroorganisms.  Even the concept of \"me\" turns out to be fuzzy\naround the edges if you examine it closely.<br/><br/>The idea that we're the center of things is difficult to discard.\nSo difficult that there's probably room to discard more.  Richard\nDawkins made another step in that direction only in the last several\ndecades, with the idea of the \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene\">selfish gene</a>.   \nNo, it turns\nout, we're not even the protagonists: we're just the latest model\nvehicle our genes have constructed to travel around in.  And having\nkids is our genes heading for the lifeboats.  Reading\nthat book snapped my brain out of its previous way of thinking the\nway Darwin's must have when it first appeared.<br/><br/>(Few people can experience now what Darwin's contemporaries did\nwhen <i>The Origin of Species</i> was first published, because everyone\nnow is raised either to take evolution for granted, or to regard\nit as a heresy. No one encounters the idea of natural selection for\nthe first time as an adult.)<br/><br/>So if you want to discover things that have been overlooked till\nnow, one really good place to look is in our blind spot: in our\nnatural, naive belief that it's all about us.  And expect to encounter\nferocious opposition if you do.<br/><br/>Conversely, if you have to choose between two theories, prefer the\none that doesn't center on you.<br/><br/>This principle isn't only for big ideas.  It works in everyday life,\ntoo.  For example, suppose you're saving a piece of cake in the fridge, and you\ncome home one day to find your housemate has eaten\nit.  Two possible theories:\n<blockquote>\na) Your housemate did it deliberately to upset you.  He <i>knew</i>\nyou were saving that piece of cake.<br/><br/>b) Your housemate was hungry.\n</blockquote>\nI say pick b.  No one knows who said \"never attribute to malice what\ncan be explained by incompetence,\" but it is a powerful idea.\nIts more general version is our answer to the Greeks:\n<blockquote>Don't see purpose where there isn't.</blockquote>\nOr better still, the positive version:\n<blockquote>See randomness.</blockquote><br/><br/></font>","date":"2006-04-01T00:00:00Z"}
