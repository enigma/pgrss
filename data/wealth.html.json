I think your best\nbet would be to start or join a startup.  That's been a \nreliable way to get rich for hundreds of years.  The word \"startup\" \ndates from the 1960s, but what happens in one is \nvery similar to the venture-backed trading voyages of the\nMiddle Ages.<br/><br/>Startups usually involve technology, so much so that the phrase\n\"high-tech startup\" is almost redundant.  A startup is a small\ncompany that takes on a hard technical problem.<br/><br/>Lots of people get rich knowing nothing more than that.\nYou don't have to know physics to be a good pitcher.  But\nI think it could give you an edge to understand the underlying principles.\nWhy do startups have to be small?  \nWill a startup inevitably stop being a startup as it\ngrows larger?  \nAnd why do they so often work on\ndeveloping new technology?   Why are there so many startups\nselling new drugs or computer software, and none selling corn oil\nor laundry detergent?<br/><br/><b>The Proposition</b><br/><br/>Economically, you can think of a startup as a way to \ncompress your whole working life into a few years.  Instead\nof working at a low intensity for forty years, you work as\nhard as you possibly can for four.  This pays especially well\nin technology, where you earn a premium for working fast.<br/><br/>Here is a brief sketch of the economic proposition.  If you're\na good hacker in your mid twenties, you can\nget a job paying about $80,000 per year.  So on average \nsuch a hacker must be\nable to do at least $80,000 worth of work per year for the \ncompany just to break even.  You could probably\nwork twice as many hours as a corporate employee, and if\nyou focus you can probably get three times as much done in\nan hour. \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/wealth.html#f1n\"><font color=\"#777777\">1</font></a>]</font>\nYou should get another multiple of two, at\nleast, by eliminating the drag \nof the pointy-haired middle\nmanager who would be your boss in a big company.\nThen there is one more multiple: how much smarter are you\nthan your job description expects you to be?\nSuppose another multiple of three.  Combine all these multipliers, and I'm\nclaiming you could be 36 times more \nproductive than you're expected to be in a random corporate\njob. \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/wealth.html#f2n\"><font color=\"#777777\">2</font></a>]</font>\n  If a fairly good hacker is worth $80,000 a year at a \nbig company, then a smart\nhacker working very hard without any corporate\nbullshit to slow him down should be able to do work worth about\n$3 million a year.<br/><br/>Like all back-of-the-envelope calculations, this one\nhas a lot of wiggle room.  I wouldn't try to\ndefend the actual numbers.  But I stand by the \nstructure of the calculation.  I'm not claiming\nthe multiplier is precisely 36, but it is certainly more\nthan 10, and probably rarely as high as 100.<br/><br/>If $3 million a year seems\nhigh, remember that we're talking about the limit case:\nthe case where you not only have zero leisure time\nbut indeed work so hard that you endanger your health.<br/><br/>Startups are not magic.  They don't change the laws of\nwealth creation.  They just represent a point at the far end of the curve.\nThere is a conservation law at work here: if\nyou want to make a million dollars, you have to endure a \nmillion dollars' worth of pain.  \nFor example, one way to\nmake a million dollars would be to work for the \nPost Office your whole life, and save every penny of your \nsalary.  Imagine the stress of working for the Post \nOffice for fifty years.   In a startup you compress all\nthis stress into three or four years.  You do tend to get a \ncertain \nbulk discount if you buy the economy-size pain,\nbut you can't evade the fundamental conservation law.\nIf starting a startup were easy, everyone would do it.<br/><br/><b>Millions, not Billions</b><br/><br/>If $3 million a year seems high to some people, it will seem\nlow to others.  Three <i>million?</i> \nHow do I get to be a billionaire, like Bill Gates?<br/><br/>So let's get Bill Gates out of the way right now.  It's not\na good idea to use famous rich people \nas examples, because the press only \nwrite about the very richest, and these tend to be outliers.\nBill Gates is a smart, determined, and hardworking man,\nbut you need more than\nthat to make as much money as he has.  You also need to be\nvery lucky.<br/><br/>There is a large random\nfactor in the success of any company.  So the guys you end \nup reading about in the papers are the ones who are very \nsmart, totally dedicated, <i>and</i> win the lottery.\nCertainly Bill is smart and dedicated, but Microsoft also \nhappens to have been the beneficiary of one of the most spectacular\nblunders in the history of business: the licensing deal for\nDOS.  No doubt Bill did \neverything he could to steer IBM into making that blunder, \nand he has done an excellent job of exploiting it, but if\nthere had been one person with a brain on IBM's side,\nMicrosoft's future would have been very different.\nMicrosoft at that stage had little leverage over IBM.\nThey were effectively a component supplier.  If IBM had \nrequired an exclusive license, as they should have, Microsoft\nwould still have signed the deal.  It would still have\nmeant a lot of money for them,  and IBM\ncould easily have gotten an operating system elsewhere.<br/><br/>Instead IBM ended up using all its power in the market\nto give Microsoft control of the PC standard.  From \nthat point, all Microsoft had to do was execute.  They\nnever had to bet the company on a bold decision.  All they\nhad to do was play hardball with licensees and copy more\ninnovative products reasonably promptly.<br/><br/>If IBM hadn't made this mistake, Microsoft would\nstill have been a successful company, but it\ncould not have grown so big so fast. \nBill Gates would be rich, but he'd be somewhere\nnear the bottom of the Forbes 400 with the other guys his age.<br/><br/>There are a lot of ways to get\nrich, and this essay is about only one of them.  This\nessay is about how to make money by creating wealth and\ngetting paid for it.  There are plenty of other ways to \nget money, including chance, speculation, marriage, inheritance, \ntheft, extortion, fraud, monopoly,\ngraft, lobbying,\ncounterfeiting, and prospecting.  Most of the greatest fortunes\nhave probably involved several of these.<br/><br/>The advantage of creating wealth, as a way to get rich,\nis not just that it's more legitimate \n(many of the other methods are now illegal) \nbut that it's more\n<i>straightforward.</i>  You just have to do something people want.<br/><br/><b>Money Is Not Wealth</b><br/><br/>If you want to create wealth, it will help to understand what it is.  \nWealth is not the same thing as money. \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/wealth.html#f3n\"><font color=\"#777777\">3</font></a>]</font>\n  Wealth is as old as\nhuman history.  Far older, in fact; ants have wealth. \nMoney is a comparatively recent invention.<br/><br/>Wealth is the fundamental thing.  Wealth is stuff we want: food, \nclothes, houses, cars, gadgets, travel to interesting places,\nand so on.  You can have wealth without\nhaving money.  If you had a magic machine that\ncould on command make you a car or cook you dinner or do your\nlaundry, or do anything else you wanted, you wouldn't need money.\nWhereas if you were in the middle of Antarctica, where there is\nnothing to buy, it wouldn't matter how much money you had.<br/><br/>Wealth is what you want, not money.  But if wealth is the important\nthing, why does everyone talk about making money?   It is\na kind of shorthand: money is a way of moving wealth, and in practice\nthey are usually interchangeable.  But they are not the same thing,\nand unless you plan to get rich by counterfeiting, talking about\n<i>making money</i> can make it harder to understand how to \nmake money.<br/><br/>Money is a side effect of specialization.\nIn a specialized society, most of the\nthings you need, you can't make for yourself.  If you want a potato\nor a pencil or a place to live, you have to get it from someone\nelse.<br/><br/>How do you get the person who grows the potatoes to give you some?\nBy giving him something he wants in return.  But you can't get\nvery far by trading things directly with the people who\nneed them.  If you make violins, and none of the local\nfarmers wants one, how will you eat?<br/><br/>The solution societies find, as they get more specialized, is to\nmake the trade into a two-step process.  Instead of trading violins\ndirectly for potatoes, you trade violins for, say, silver, \nwhich you can then trade again for anything else you need.  The\nintermediate stuff-- the <i>medium of exchange</i>-- can be anything that's\nrare and portable.  Historically metals have been the most common,\nbut recently we've been using a medium of exchange, called the <i>dollar</i>,\nthat doesn't physically exist.  It works as a medium of exchange,\nhowever, because its rarity \nis guaranteed by the U.S. Government.<br/><br/>The advantage of a medium of exchange is that it makes trade work.\nThe disadvantage is that it tends to obscure what trade really\nmeans.  People think that what a business does is make money.\nBut money is just the intermediate stage-- just\na shorthand-- for whatever people want.\nWhat most businesses really do is make  \nwealth.  They do something people want. \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/wealth.html#f4n\"><font color=\"#777777\">4</font></a>]</font><br/><br/><b>The Pie Fallacy</b><br/><br/>A surprising number of people retain from childhood the idea\nthat there is a fixed amount of wealth in the world. \nThere is, in any normal family, a fixed amount of <i>money</i> at \nany moment.  But that's not the same thing.<br/><br/>When wealth is talked about in this context, it is often\ndescribed as a pie.  \"You can't make the pie larger,\"\nsay politicians.\nWhen you're\ntalking about the amount of money in one family's bank\naccount, or the amount available to a government from one\nyear's tax revenue, this is true.  \nIf one person gets more, someone else has to get less.<br/><br/>I can remember believing, as a child, that if a few\nrich people had all the money, it left less for everyone else.\nMany people seem to continue to believe something like this\nwell into adulthood.  This fallacy is usually there in the \nbackground when you hear someone talking about how x percent\nof the population have y percent of the wealth.  If you plan\nto start a startup, then whether you realize it or not, you're\nplanning to disprove the Pie Fallacy.<br/><br/>What leads people astray here is the abstraction of\nmoney.  Money is not wealth.  It's\njust something we use to move wealth around.\nSo although there may be, in certain specific moments (like\nyour family, this month) a fixed amount of money available to\ntrade with other people for things you want,\nthere is not a fixed amount of wealth in the world.  \n<i>You can make more wealth.</i>  Wealth has been getting created and\ndestroyed (but on balance, created) for all of human history.<br/><br/>Suppose you own a beat-up old car. \nInstead of sitting on your butt next\nsummer, you could spend the time restoring your car to pristine condition.\nIn doing so you create wealth.  The world is-- and\nyou specifically are-- one pristine old car the richer.  And not\njust in some metaphorical way.  If you sell your car,\nyou'll get more for it.<br/><br/>In restoring your old car you have made yourself\nricher.  You haven't made anyone else poorer.  So there is\nobviously not a fixed pie.  And in fact, when you look at \nit this way, you wonder why anyone would think there was. \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/wealth.html#f5n\"><font color=\"#777777\">5</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Kids know, without knowing they know, that they can create\nwealth.  If you need to give someone a present and don't\nhave any money, you make one.  But kids are so bad at making\nthings that they consider home-made presents to be a distinct,\ninferior, sort of thing to store-bought ones-- a mere expression\nof the proverbial thought that counts. \nAnd indeed, the lumpy ashtrays\nwe made for our parents did not have much of a resale market.<br/><br/><b>Craftsmen</b><br/><br/>The people most likely to grasp that wealth can be\ncreated are the ones who are good at making things, the craftsmen.\nTheir hand-made objects become store-bought ones. \nBut with the rise of industrialization there are fewer and\nfewer craftsmen.  One of the biggest remaining groups  is\ncomputer programmers.<br/><br/>A programmer can sit down in front of a computer and\n<i>create wealth</i>.  A good piece of software is, in itself, \na valuable thing.\nThere is no manufacturing to confuse the issue.  Those\ncharacters you type \nare a complete, finished product.\nIf someone sat down and wrote a web\nbrowser that didn't suck (a fine idea, by the way), the world\nwould be that much richer.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/wealth.html#f5bn\"><font color=\"#777777\">5b</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Everyone in a company works together to create\nwealth, in the sense of making more things people want.\nMany of the employees (e.g. the people in the mailroom or\nthe personnel department) work at one remove from the \nactual making of stuff.  Not the programmers.  They\nliterally think the product, one line at a time.\nAnd so it's clearer to programmers that wealth is something\nthat's made, rather than being distributed, like slices of a\npie, by some imaginary Daddy.<br/><br/>It's also obvious to programmers that there are huge variations\nin the rate at which wealth is created.  At Viaweb we had one\nprogrammer who was a sort of monster of productivity.  \nI remember watching what he did one long day and estimating that\nhe had added several hundred thousand dollars\nto the market value of the company. \nA great programmer, on a roll, could \ncreate a million dollars worth of wealth in a couple weeks.\nA mediocre programmer over the same period will generate zero or\neven negative wealth (e.g. by introducing bugs).<br/><br/>This is\nwhy so many of the best programmers are libertarians.\nIn our world, you sink or swim, and there are no excuses.\nWhen those far removed from the creation of wealth-- undergraduates,\nreporters, politicians-- hear\nthat the richest 5% of the people have \nhalf the total wealth, they tend to think <i>injustice!</i>\nAn experienced programmer would be more likely to think\n<i>is that all?</i>  The top 5% of programmers\nprobably write 99% of the good software.<br/><br/>Wealth can be created without being sold.  Scientists, till\nrecently at least, effectively donated the wealth they \ncreated.  We are all richer for knowing about penicillin,\nbecause we're less likely to die from infections.  Wealth\nis whatever people want, and not dying is certainly something\nwe want.  Hackers often donate their work by \nwriting open source software that anyone can use for free.\nI am much the richer for the operating system\nFreeBSD, which I'm running on the computer I'm using now,\nand so is Yahoo, which runs it on all their servers.<br/><br/><b>What a Job Is</b><br/><br/>In industrialized countries, people belong to one institution or\nanother at least until their twenties.  After all those years you get\nused to the idea of belonging to a group of people who all get up\nin the morning, go to some set of buildings, and do things that they\ndo not, ordinarily, enjoy doing.  Belonging to such a group becomes\npart of your identity: name, age, role, institution.\nIf you have to introduce yourself, or\nsomeone else describes you, it will be as something like, John\nSmith, age 10, a student at such and such elementary school, or\nJohn Smith, age 20, a student at such and such college.<br/><br/>When John Smith finishes school he is expected to get a job.  And\nwhat getting a job seems to mean is joining another institution.\nSuperficially it's a lot like college.  You pick the companies you\nwant to work for and apply to join them.  If one likes you, you\nbecome a member of this new group.  You get up in the morning and\ngo to a new set of buildings, and do things that you do not, ordinarily,\nenjoy doing.  There are a few differences: life is not as much fun,\nand you get paid, instead of paying, as you did in college.  But\nthe similarities feel greater than the differences.  John Smith is\nnow John Smith, 22, a software developer at such and such corporation.<br/><br/>In fact John Smith's\nlife has changed more than he realizes.  Socially, a company\nlooks much like college, but the deeper you go into the\nunderlying reality, the more different it gets.<br/><br/>What a company does, and has to do if it wants to continue to\nexist, is earn money.  And the way most companies make money\nis by creating wealth.  Companies can be so specialized that this\nsimilarity is concealed, but it is not only manufacturing \ncompanies that create wealth.  A big component of wealth is\nlocation. \nRemember that magic machine that could\nmake you cars and cook you dinner and so on?  It would not be\nso useful if it delivered your dinner to a random location\nin central Asia.  \nIf wealth means what people want, companies that move\nthings also create wealth.  Ditto for\nmany other kinds of companies that don't make anything\nphysical.  Nearly all companies exist to do something people\nwant.<br/><br/>And that's what you do, as well, when you go to work for a company.\nBut here there is another layer that tends to obscure the underlying\nreality.  In a company, the work you do is averaged together with\na lot of other people's.  \nYou may not even be aware you're doing something people\nwant.  Your contribution may be indirect.  But the company as a\nwhole must be giving people something they want, or they won't make\nany money.  And if they are paying you x dollars a year, then on\naverage you must be contributing at least x dollars a year worth\nof work, or the company will be spending more than it makes,\nand will go out of business.<br/><br/>Someone graduating from college thinks, and is told, that he needs\nto get a job, as if the important thing were becoming a member of \nan institution.  A more direct way to put it would be: you need to\nstart doing something people want.  You don't\nneed to\njoin a company to do that.  All a company is is a group of people\nworking together to do something people want.  It's doing something people\nwant that matters, not joining the group. \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/wealth.html#f6n\"><font color=\"#777777\">6</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>For most people the   \nbest plan probably is to go to work for some existing\ncompany.  But it is a good idea to understand what's happening   \nwhen you do this.  A job means doing something people want,\naveraged together with everyone else in that company.<br/><br/><b>Working Harder</b><br/><br/>That averaging gets to be a problem.\nI think the single biggest problem afflicting large companies is the   \ndifficulty of assigning a value to each person's work. \nFor the most part they punt.  In a\nbig company you get paid a fairly predictable salary for working \nfairly hard.  You're expected not to be obviously incompetent or\nlazy, but you're not expected to devote your whole life to your\nwork.<br/><br/>It turns out, though, that there are economies of scale in how much of your\nlife you devote to your work.  In the right kind of business,  \nsomeone who really devoted himself to work could generate ten or\neven a hundred times as much wealth as an average\nemployee.  A programmer, for example, instead of chugging along\nmaintaining and updating an existing piece of software, could write\na whole new piece of software, and with it create a new source of\nrevenue.<br/><br/>Companies are not set up to reward people who want to do this. \nYou can't go to your boss and say, I'd like to start working ten\ntimes as hard, so will you please pay me ten times as much? For\none thing, the official fiction is that you are already working as\nhard as you can.  But a more serious problem is that the company\nhas no way of measuring the value of your work.<br/><br/>Salesmen are an exception.  It's easy \nto measure how much revenue they generate, and they're\nusually paid a percentage of it.  If a salesman wants to work harder,\nhe can just start doing it, and he will automatically\nget paid proportionally more.<br/><br/>There is one other job besides sales where big companies can\nhire first-rate people: in the top management jobs. \nAnd for the same reason: their performance can\nbe measured.  The top managers are\nheld responsible for the performance of the entire company.\nBecause an ordinary employee's performance can't usually\nbe measured, he is not expected to do\nmore than put in a solid effort.  Whereas top management, like\nsalespeople, have to actually come up with the numbers.\nThe CEO of a company that tanks cannot plead that he put in  \na solid effort.  If the company does badly, he's done badly.<br/><br/>A company that could pay all its employees so straightforwardly   \nwould be enormously successful.  Many employees would work harder\nif they could get paid for it.  More importantly,\nsuch a company would attract people who wanted to work\nespecially hard. \nIt would crush its competitors.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, companies can't pay everyone like salesmen.  Salesmen\nwork alone.  Most employees' work is tangled together.  Suppose\na company makes some kind of consumer gadget.  The \nengineers build a reliable gadget with all kinds of new features;\nthe industrial designers design a beautiful case for it; and then\nthe marketing people convince everyone that\nit's something they've got to have.  How do you know how much of the\ngadget's sales are due to each group's efforts?  Or, for that\nmatter, how much is due to the creators of past gadgets that gave\nthe company a reputation for quality?  There's no way to  \nuntangle all their contributions.  Even if you could read the minds\nof the consumers, you'd find these factors were all blurred together.<br/><br/>If you want to go faster, it's a problem to have your work\ntangled together with a large number of other people's.  In a  \nlarge group, your performance is not separately measurable-- and \nthe rest of the group slows you down.<br/><br/><b>Measurement and Leverage</b><br/><br/>To get rich you need to get yourself in a situation with two\nthings, measurement and leverage.  You need to be in a\nposition where your performance can be measured, or there is\nno way to get paid more by doing more.  And you have to\nhave leverage, in the sense that the decisions you make have   \na big effect.<br/><br/>Measurement alone is not enough.  An example of a job with\nmeasurement but not leverage is doing piecework in a\nsweatshop.  Your performance is measured and you get paid  \naccordingly, but you have no scope for decisions.  The only\ndecision you get to make is how fast you work, and that\ncan probably only increase your earnings by a factor\nof two or three.<br/><br/>An example of a job with both measurement and leverage would\nbe lead actor in a movie.  Your performance can be measured in the\ngross of the movie.  And you have leverage in the sense that your\nperformance can make or break it.<br/><br/>CEOs also have both measurement and leverage.  They're measured,\nin that the performance of the company is their performance.\nAnd they have leverage in that their decisions\nset the whole company moving in one direction or another.<br/><br/>I think everyone who gets rich by their own efforts will be\nfound to be in a situation with measurement and leverage.    \nEveryone I can think of does: CEOs, movie stars, \nhedge fund managers, professional athletes.  A good hint to the\npresence of leverage is the possibility of failure.\nUpside must be balanced by downside, so if there is \nbig potential for gain there must also be a terrifying\npossibility of loss.  CEOs, stars, fund managers, and athletes\nall live with the sword hanging over their heads;\nthe moment they start to suck, they're out.  If you're in\na job that feels safe, you are not going to get rich,\nbecause if there is no danger there is almost certainly no leverage.<br/><br/>But you don't have to become a CEO or a movie star to\nbe in a situation with measurement and leverage.  All you        \nneed to do is be part of a small group working on a\nhard problem.<br/><br/><b>Smallness = Measurement</b><br/><br/>If you can't measure the value of the work done by individual  \nemployees, you can get close.  You can measure the value\nof the work done by small groups.<br/><br/>One level at which you can accurately measure the revenue\ngenerated by employees is at the level of the whole company.   \nWhen the company is small, you are thereby fairly close to \nmeasuring the contributions of individual employees.  A viable\nstartup might only have ten employees, which puts you within a\nfactor of ten of measuring individual effort.<br/><br/>Starting or joining a startup is thus as close as most\npeople can get to saying to one's boss, I want to work ten times\nas hard, so please pay me ten times as much.  There are two\ndifferences: you're not saying it to your boss, but directly to the\ncustomers (for whom your boss is only a proxy after all), and\nyou're not doing it individually, but along with a small group\nof other ambitious people.<br/><br/>It will, ordinarily, be a group.  Except in a few unusual kinds\nof work, like acting or writing books, you can't be a company \nof one person.  \nAnd the people you work with had better be good, because it's their work that\nyours is going to be averaged with.<br/><br/>A big company is like a giant galley driven by a thousand rowers.\nTwo things keep the speed of the\ngalley down.  One is that individual rowers don't see any\nresult from working harder. \nThe other is that, in a group of a\nthousand people, the average rower is likely  to be\npretty average.<br/><br/>If you took ten people at random out of the big galley and\nput them in a boat by themselves, they could probably go  \nfaster.  They would have both carrot and stick to motivate   \nthem.  An energetic rower would be encouraged by the thought\nthat he could have a visible effect on the speed of\nthe boat.  And if someone was lazy, the others would be more likely\nto notice and complain.<br/><br/>But the real advantage of the ten-man boat shows when \nyou take the ten <i>best</i> rowers out of the big galley\nand put them in a boat together.  They will have all\nthe extra motivation that comes from being in a small group.\nBut more importantly, by selecting that small a group\nyou can get the best rowers.  Each one will be in\nthe top 1%.  It's a much better deal for them to average  \ntheir work together with a small group of their peers than to    \naverage it with everyone.<br/><br/>That's the real point of startups.  Ideally, you are getting\ntogether with a group of other people who also want to work\na lot harder, and get paid a lot more, than they would in\na big company.  And because startups tend to get founded \nby self-selecting groups of ambitious people who already \nknow one another (at least by reputation), the level of \nmeasurement is more precise than you get from smallness alone.\nA startup is not merely ten people, but ten people like you.<br/><br/>Steve Jobs once said that the success or failure of a startup\ndepends on the first ten employees.  I agree. If \nanything, it's more like the first five.\nBeing small is not, in itself, what makes startups kick butt,   \nbut rather that small groups can be select.\nYou don't want small in the sense of a\nvillage, but small in the sense of an all-star team.<br/><br/>The larger a group, the closer its average member will be to the average\nfor the population as a whole.   So all other things being\nequal, a very able person in a big company is probably\ngetting a bad deal, because his performance is dragged down by\nthe overall lower performance of the others.  Of course,\nall other things often are not equal: the able person may \nnot care about money, or may prefer the stability of a large\ncompany.  But a very able person who does care about money\nwill ordinarily do better to go off and work with a small\ngroup of peers.<br/><br/><b>Technology = Leverage</b><br/><br/>Startups offer anyone a way to be in a situation with\nmeasurement and leverage.\nThey allow measurement because they're small,\nand they offer leverage because they\nmake money by inventing new technology.<br/><br/>What is technology?  It's <i>technique</i>. It's the way  \nwe all do things.  And when\nyou discover a new way to do things, its value is multiplied\nby all the people who use it.  It is the proverbial fishing\nrod, rather than the fish.  That's the difference between a\nstartup and a restaurant or a barber shop.  You fry eggs or cut \nhair one customer at a time.  Whereas if \nyou solve a technical problem that a lot of people care about,\nyou help everyone who uses your solution.  \nThat's leverage.<br/><br/>If you look at history, it seems that most people\nwho got rich by creating wealth did it by developing\nnew technology.  You just can't fry eggs or cut hair fast enough.\nWhat made the Florentines rich in 1200 \nwas the discovery of new techniques for making the high-tech \nproduct of the time, fine woven cloth.  What made the\nDutch rich in 1600 was the discovery of shipbuilding and\nnavigation techniques that enabled them to dominate the seas\nof the Far East.<br/><br/>Fortunately there is a natural fit between smallness and\nsolving hard problems.  The leading edge of technology moves\nfast.  Technology that's valuable today could be worthless\nin a couple years.  Small companies are more at home in this\nworld, because they don't have layers of bureaucracy to\nslow them down.\nAlso, technical advances tend to come from unorthodox approaches,\nand small companies are less constrained by convention.<br/><br/>Big companies can develop technology.  They just can't do it\nquickly.  Their size makes them slow and prevents\nthem from rewarding employees for the extraordinary\neffort required.  So in practice big companies only get to develop \ntechnology in fields where large capital requirements prevent startups from\ncompeting with them, like microprocessors, power plants, \nor passenger aircraft.  And even in those fields they depend heavily\non startups for components and ideas.<br/><br/>It's obvious that biotech or software startups exist to solve\nhard technical problems, but \nI think it will also be found to be true \nin businesses that don't seem to be about technology.  McDonald's,\nfor example, grew big by designing a system, the McDonald's \nfranchise, that could then be reproduced at will all over the \nface of the earth.  A McDonald's franchise is controlled by rules\nso precise that it is practically\na piece of software.  Write once, run everywhere.\nDitto for Wal-Mart.  Sam Walton got rich not by being a \nretailer, but by designing a new kind of store.<br/><br/>Use difficulty as a guide not just in selecting the overall\naim of your company, but also at decision points along the way.\nAt Viaweb one of our rules of thumb was <i>run upstairs.</i>\nSuppose you are a little, nimble guy being chased by a big,\nfat, bully.  You open a door and find yourself in a    \nstaircase.  Do you go up or down?  I say up.  The\nbully can probably run downstairs as fast as you can.\nGoing upstairs his bulk will be more of a disadvantage.\nRunning upstairs is hard for you but even harder for him.<br/><br/>What this meant in practice was that we deliberately sought      \nhard problems.  If there were two features we could add to our\nsoftware, both equally valuable in proportion to their difficulty,\nwe'd always take the harder one.  Not just because it was \nmore valuable, but <i>because it was harder.</i>\nWe delighted in forcing bigger, slower competitors\nto follow us over difficult ground.\nLike guerillas, startups prefer the difficult terrain of the\nmountains, where the troops of the central government\ncan't follow.  I can remember times when we were just\nexhausted after wrestling all day with some horrible technical\nproblem.  And I'd be delighted, because something that was \nhard for us would be impossible for our competitors.<br/><br/>This is not just a good way to run a startup.  It's what\na startup is.\nVenture capitalists know about this and have a phrase for it:\n<i>barriers to entry.</i>  If you go to a VC with a new \nidea and ask him to invest in it, one of the first things\nhe'll ask is, how hard would this be for someone else to  \ndevelop?  That is, how much difficult ground\nhave you put between yourself and potential pursuers? \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/wealth.html#f7n\"><font color=\"#777777\">7</font></a>]</font>\nAnd you had better have a convincing explanation of why \nyour technology would be hard to duplicate.  Otherwise as\nsoon as some big company becomes aware of it, they'll make\ntheir own, and with their brand name, capital, and\ndistribution clout, they'll take away your market overnight.\nYou'd be like guerillas caught in the open field by regular\narmy forces.<br/><br/>One way to put up barriers to entry is through patents. \nBut patents may not provide much protection. \nCompetitors commonly find ways to work around a patent.\nAnd if they can't, they \nmay simply violate it and invite you to sue them.\nA big company is not afraid to be sued; it's an everyday thing\nfor them.  They'll make sure that suing them is expensive and\ntakes a long time.\nEver heard of Philo Farnsworth?  He invented\ntelevision.  The reason you've never\nheard of him is that his company was not the one to make\nmoney from it. \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/wealth.html#f8n\"><font color=\"#777777\">8</font></a>]</font>\nThe company that did was RCA, and\nFarnsworth's reward for his efforts was a decade of\npatent litigation.<br/><br/>Here, as so often, the best defense is a good offense.  If\nyou can develop technology that's simply too hard for\ncompetitors to duplicate, you don't need to rely on other\ndefenses.  Start by picking a hard problem, and\nthen at every decision point, take the harder choice. \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/wealth.html#f9n\"><font color=\"#777777\">9</font></a>]</font><br/><br/><b>The Catch(es)</b><br/><br/>If it were simply a matter of working harder than \nan ordinary employee and getting paid proportionately, it would\nobviously be a good deal to start a startup.  Up to a point it\nwould be more fun. I don't think many people \nlike the slow pace of big companies, the interminable meetings,\nthe water-cooler conversations, the clueless middle managers,\nand so on.<br/><br/>Unfortunately there are a couple catches.  One is that you\ncan't choose the point on the curve that you want to inhabit.\nYou can't decide, for example, that you'd like to work just\ntwo or three times as hard, and get paid that much more.  When\nyou're running a startup, your competitors decide how\nhard you work.  And they pretty much all make the same decision:\nas hard as you possibly can.<br/><br/>The other catch is that the payoff is only on average proportionate\nto your productivity.  There is, as I said before, a large\nrandom multiplier in the success of any company.  So in\npractice the deal is not that you're 30 times as productive and get \npaid 30 times as much.  It is that you're 30 times as productive,\nand get paid between zero and a thousand times as much.\nIf the mean is 30x, the median is probably zero.\nMost startups tank, and not just the dogfood \nportals we all heard about during\nthe Internet Bubble.  It's common for a startup\nto be developing a genuinely good product, take slightly\ntoo long to do it, run out of money, and have to shut down.<br/><br/>A startup is like a mosquito.  A bear can absorb a hit and a crab\nis armored against one, but a mosquito is designed for one thing:\nto score.  No energy is wasted on defense.  The defense of mosquitos, \nas a species, is that there are a lot of them, but this is little \nconsolation to the individual mosquito.<br/><br/>Startups, like mosquitos, tend to be an all-or-nothing proposition.\nAnd you don't generally know which of the two you're going to\nget till the last minute. \nViaweb came close to tanking several times. Our trajectory\nwas like a sine wave.  Fortunately we got bought at\nthe top of the cycle, but it was damned close.   While we were\nvisiting Yahoo in California to talk about selling the company\nto them, we had to borrow a conference room to reassure\nan investor who was about to back out of a new round of funding \nthat we needed to stay alive.<br/><br/>The all-or-nothing aspect of startups was not something we wanted.\nViaweb's hackers were all extremely risk-averse.\nIf there had been some way just to work super hard and get\npaid for it, without having a lottery mixed in, we would have\nbeen delighted.  We would have much preferred a 100% chance of\n$1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million, even though \ntheoretically the second is worth twice as much.   Unfortunately,\nthere is not currently any space in the business world where\nyou can get the first deal.<br/><br/>The closest you can get is by\nselling your startup in the early stages, giving up upside  \n(and risk) for a smaller but guaranteed payoff.  We had a \nchance to do this, and stupidly, as we then thought, let it slip by.\nAfter that we became comically eager to sell.\nFor the next year or so,\nif anyone expressed the slightest curiosity about Viaweb\nwe would try to sell them the company.  But there were no takers,\nso we had to keep going.<br/><br/>It would have been a bargain to \nbuy us at an early stage, but companies doing acquisitions are not\nlooking for bargains.  A company big enough to acquire \nstartups will be big enough to be fairly conservative, and \nwithin the company the people in charge of acquisitions will\nbe among the more conservative, because they are likely to be\nbusiness school types who joined the company late.  \nThey would rather overpay for a safe choice.  So\nit is easier to sell an established startup, even at a large\npremium, than an early-stage one.<br/><br/><b>Get Users</b><br/><br/>I think it's a good idea to get bought, if you can.  Running a\nbusiness is different from growing one.\nIt is just as well to let a big company take over once you reach \ncruising altitude.  It's\nalso financially wiser, because selling allows you to diversify.\nWhat would you think of a financial advisor who put all his\nclient's assets into one volatile stock?<br/><br/>How do you get bought?  Mostly by doing the same things \nyou'd do if you didn't intend to sell the company.  Being \nprofitable, for example.   But getting bought is also an art\nin its own right, and one that we spent a lot of time trying\nto master.<br/><br/>Potential buyers will\nalways delay if they can.  The hard part about getting\nbought is getting them to act.  For most people, the most powerful motivator\nis not the hope of gain, but the fear of loss.  For potential\nacquirers, the most powerful motivator is the prospect that \none of their competitors will buy you.  This, as we found, \ncauses CEOs to take red-eyes.  \nThe second biggest is the worry that, if they don't buy you \nnow, you'll continue to grow rapidly and will cost more to\nacquire later, or even become a competitor.<br/><br/>In both cases, what it all comes down to is users.  \nYou'd think that a company about to buy you would do a lot of\nresearch and decide for themselves how valuable your technology\nwas.  Not at all.  What they go by is the number of users you\nhave.<br/><br/>In effect, acquirers assume the customers know who has the\nbest technology.  And this is not as stupid as it sounds.  Users \nare the only real proof that you've created wealth.  Wealth is \nwhat people want, and if people aren't using your software,\nmaybe it's not just because you're bad at marketing.  Maybe it's\nbecause you haven't made what they want.<br/><br/>Venture capitalists have a list of danger signs to watch out for.\nNear the top is the company run by techno-weenies who are \nobsessed with solving interesting technical problems, instead\nof making users happy.  In a startup, you're not just trying to\nsolve problems.  You're trying to solve problems <i>that \nusers care about.</i><br/><br/>So I think you should make users the test, just as \nacquirers do.  Treat a startup as an optimization problem \nin which performance is measured by number of users.  As anyone\nwho has tried to optimize software knows, the key is measurement.\nWhen you try to guess where your program is slow, and what would\nmake it faster, you almost always guess wrong.<br/><br/>Number of users may not be the perfect test, but it will \nbe very close.  It's what acquirers care about.  It's what \nrevenues depend on.  \nIt's what makes competitors unhappy.\nIt's what impresses reporters, and potential\nnew users.  Certainly it's a better test than your a priori\nnotions of what problems are important to solve, no matter how\ntechnically adept you are.<br/><br/>Among other things, treating a startup as an optimization\nproblem will help you avoid another\npitfall that VCs worry about, and rightly-- taking a long time\nto develop a product.  Now we can recognize this as something\nhackers already know to avoid: premature optimization.  Get a version \n1.0 out there as soon as you can.  Until you have some users to\nmeasure, you're optimizing based on guesses.<br/><br/>The ball you need to keep your eye on here is the underlying\nprinciple that wealth is what people want.  If you plan to get \nrich by creating wealth, you have to know what people want.  \nSo few businesses really pay attention to making customers happy.\nHow often do you walk into a store, or call a company on the\nphone, with a feeling of dread in the back of your mind?\nWhen you hear \"your call is important to us, please stay on\nthe line,\" do you think, oh good, now everything will be all right?<br/><br/>A restaurant can afford to serve the occasional burnt dinner.\nBut in technology, you cook one thing and that's what everyone\neats.  So any difference between what people want and what\nyou deliver is multiplied.  \nYou please or annoy\ncustomers wholesale.  The closer you can get to what they want,\nthe more wealth you generate.<br/><br/><b>Wealth and Power</b><br/><br/>Making wealth is not the only way to get rich.  For most of\nhuman history it has not even been the most common.  Until\na few centuries ago,\nthe main sources of wealth were mines, slaves and serfs,\nland, and cattle,\nand the only ways to acquire these rapidly were by inheritance,\nmarriage, conquest, or confiscation.  \nNaturally wealth had a bad reputation.<br/><br/>Two things changed.  The first was the rule of law.  For most of the world's\nhistory, if you did somehow accumulate a fortune, the ruler or his \nhenchmen \nwould find a way to steal it.\nBut in medieval Europe something new happened.\nA new class of merchants and manufacturers\nbegan to collect in towns. \n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/wealth.html#f10n\"><font color=\"#777777\">10</font></a>]</font>\nTogether they were able to withstand the local feudal\nlord.  So \nfor the first time in our history, the bullies stopped stealing the\nnerds' lunch money.\nThis was naturally a great incentive,\nand possibly indeed the main cause of the second big change,\nindustrialization.<br/><br/>A great deal has been written about the causes of the Industrial \nRevolution.  But surely a necessary, if not sufficient, condition\nwas that people who made fortunes be able to enjoy them in peace.\n<font color=\"#777777\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/wealth.html#f11n\"><font color=\"#777777\">11</font></a>]</font>\nOne piece of evidence is what happened to countries\nthat tried to return to the old model, like the Soviet\nUnion, and to a lesser extent Britain under the labor\ngovernments of the 1960s and early 1970s.  Take away the incentive\nof wealth, and technical innovation grinds to a halt.<br/><br/>Remember what a startup is, economically: \na way of saying, I want to work faster.  Instead of accumulating\nmoney slowly by being paid a regular wage for fifty years, I \nwant to get it over with as soon as possible.  So governments\nthat forbid you to accumulate wealth are in effect decreeing\nthat you work slowly.  They're willing to let you earn $3 million over\nfifty years, but they're not willing to let you work so hard that\nyou can do it in two.  They are like\nthe corporate boss that you can't go to and say, I want to work\nten times as hard, so please pay me ten times a much.\nExcept this is not a boss you can escape by starting your own\ncompany.<br/><br/>The problem with working slowly is not just that technical\ninnovation happens slowly.  It's that it tends not to happen at all.\nIt's only when you're deliberately looking for hard problems,\nas a way to use speed to the greatest advantage, that you take\non this kind of project.  Developing new technology is a \npain in the ass. It is, as Edison said, one percent \ninspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration.  \nWithout the incentive of wealth, no one wants to do it.\nEngineers will work on sexy projects like fighter planes and moon\nrockets for ordinary salaries, but more mundane technologies\nlike light bulbs or semiconductors have to be developed by entrepreneurs.<br/><br/>Startups\nare not just something that happened in Silicon Valley in \nthe last couple decades.  Since it became possible to\nget rich by creating wealth, everyone who has done it has\nused essentially the same recipe: measurement and leverage,\nwhere measurement comes from working with a small\ngroup, and leverage from developing new techniques.\nThe recipe was the same in Florence in 1200 as it is \nin Santa Clara today.<br/><br/>Understanding this may help to answer an important question:\nwhy Europe grew so powerful.\nWas it something about the geography of \nEurope?  Was it that Europeans are somehow racially superior?\nWas it their religion?  The answer (or at least\nthe proximate cause) may be that the\nEuropeans \nrode on the crest of a powerful new idea: allowing those who\nmade a lot of money to keep it.<br/><br/>Once you're allowed to do that, \npeople who want to get rich can do it by generating\nwealth instead of stealing it.\nThe resulting technological growth translates not only \ninto wealth but into military power.  The theory that led to\nthe stealth plane was developed by a Soviet mathematician.\nBut because the Soviet Union didn't have a computer industry,\nit remained for them a theory;\nthey didn't have hardware capable of executing the calculations\nfast enough to design an actual airplane.<br/><br/>In that respect the Cold War teaches the same lesson as\nWorld War II and, for that matter, most wars in recent history.\nDon't let a ruling\nclass of warriors and politicians squash the entrepreneurs.\nThe same recipe that makes individuals rich\nmakes countries powerful.  Let the nerds keep their lunch\nmoney, and you rule the world.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nOne valuable thing you tend to get only in startups is\n<i>uninterruptability</i>.  Different kinds of\nwork have different time quanta.  Someone proofreading a\nmanuscript\ncould probably be interrupted every fifteen minutes\nwith little loss of productivity.  But the time quantum for\nhacking is very long: it might take an hour just to load\na problem into your head.  So the\ncost of having someone from personnel\ncall you about a form you forgot to fill out can be huge.<br/><br/>This is why hackers give you such a baleful stare as they\nturn from their screen to answer your question.  Inside\ntheir heads a giant house of cards is tottering.<br/><br/>The mere possibility of being interrupted deters hackers\nfrom starting hard projects.  This is why they\ntend to work late at night, and why it's next to impossible\nto write great software in a cubicle (except late at night).<br/><br/>One great advantage of startups is that they don't yet have\nany of the people who interrupt you.  There is no personnel\ndepartment, and thus no form nor anyone to call you about it.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f2n\"><font color=\"#000000\">2</font></a>]\nFaced with the idea that people working for startups might be\n20 or 30 times as productive as those working for large companies,\nexecutives at large companies will naturally wonder, how could\nI get the people working for me to do that?  The answer is\nsimple: pay them to.<br/><br/>Internally most companies are run like Communist states.\nIf you believe in free markets, why not turn your company into one?<br/><br/>Hypothesis: A company will be maximally profitable when each\nemployee is paid in proportion to the wealth they generate.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f3n\"><font color=\"#000000\">3</font></a>]\nUntil recently even governments sometimes didn't grasp the\ndistinction between money and wealth.  Adam\nSmith (<i>Wealth of Nations</i>, v:i) mentions several\nthat tried to preserve their\n\"wealth\" by forbidding the export of gold or silver.\nBut having more of the medium of exchange would not make\na country richer; if you have more money chasing the same\namount of material wealth, the only result is higher prices.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f4n\"><font color=\"#000000\">4</font></a>]\nThere are many senses of the word \"wealth,\" not all of\nthem material.  I'm not trying to make a deep philosophical\npoint here about which\nis the true kind.  I'm writing about one specific,\nrather technical sense of the word \"wealth.\"  What\npeople will give you money for.\nThis is an interesting sort of wealth to study, because\nit is the kind that prevents you from starving.\nAnd what people will give you money for depends on them,\nnot you.<br/><br/>When you're starting a business,\nit's easy to slide into thinking that customers\nwant what you do.  During the Internet Bubble I talked\nto a woman who, because she liked the outdoors, was\nstarting an \"outdoor portal.\" You know what\nkind of business you should start if you like\nthe outdoors?  One to recover data from crashed hard disks.<br/><br/>What's the connection?  None at all.  Which is precisely my point.\nIf you want\nto create wealth (in the narrow technical sense of not\nstarving) then you should be especially skeptical about any\nplan that centers on things you like doing.\nThat is where your idea of what's valuable is least\nlikely to coincide with other people's.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f5n\"><font color=\"#000000\">5</font></a>]\nIn the average car restoration you probably do make everyone\nelse microscopically poorer, by doing a small amount of damage to\nthe environment.

So as\na rule, if you know the \"inventor\" of something\n(the telephone, the assembly line, the airplane, \nthe light bulb, the transistor) it is because their\ncompany made money from it, and the company's PR people worked\nhard to spread the story.  If you don't know who invented\nsomething (the automobile, the television, the computer,\nthe jet engine, the laser), it's because other companies\nmade all the money.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f9n\"><font color=\"#000000\">9</font></a>]\nThis is a good plan for life in general.\nIf you have two choices, choose the harder.\nIf you're trying to decide whether to go out running or\nsit home and watch TV, go running.\nProbably the reason this trick works so well is that\nwhen you have two choices and one is harder, the\nonly reason you're even considering the other is laziness.\nYou know in the back of your mind what's the right thing\nto do, and this trick merely forces you to acknowledge it.<br/><br/>[<a name=\"f10n\"><font color=\"#000000\">10</font></a>]\nIt is probably no accident that the middle class\nfirst appeared in northern Italy and the low countries,\nwhere there were no strong central governments.
