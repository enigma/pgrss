{"href":"highres.html","title":"The High-Res Society","content":"<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"2\">December 2008<br/><br/>For nearly all of history the success of a society was proportionate\nto its ability to assemble large and disciplined organizations.\nThose who bet on economies of scale generally won, which meant the\nlargest organizations were the most successful ones.<br/><br/>Things have already changed so much that this is hard for us to\nbelieve, but till just a few decades ago the largest organizations\ntended to be the most progressive.  An ambitious kid graduating\nfrom college in 1960 wanted to work in the huge, gleaming offices\nof Ford, or General Electric, or NASA.  Small meant small-time.\nSmall in 1960 didn't mean a cool little startup.  It meant uncle\nSid's shoe store.<br/><br/>When I grew up in the 1970s, the idea of the \"corporate ladder\" was\nstill very much alive.  The standard plan was to try to get into a\ngood college, from which one would be drafted into some organization\nand then rise to positions of gradually increasing responsibility.\nThe more ambitious merely hoped to climb the same ladder faster.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/highres.html#f1n\"><font color=\"#999999\">1</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>But in the late twentieth century something changed.  It turned out\nthat economies of scale were not the only force at work.  Particularly\nin technology, the increase in speed one could get from smaller\ngroups started to trump the advantages of size.<br/><br/>The future turned out to be different from the one we were expecting\nin 1970.  The domed cities and flying cars we expected have failed\nto materialize.  But fortunately so have the jumpsuits with badges\nindicating our specialty and rank.  Instead of being dominated by\na few, giant tree-structured organizations, it's now looking like\nthe economy of the future will be a fluid network of smaller,\nindependent units.<br/><br/>It's not so much that large organizations stopped working.  There's\nno evidence that famously successful organizations like the Roman\narmy or the British East India Company were any less afflicted by\nprotocol and politics than organizations of the same size today.\nBut they were competing against opponents who couldn't change the\nrules on the fly by discovering new technology.  Now it turns out\nthe rule \"large and disciplined organizations win\" needs to have a\nqualification appended: \"at games that change slowly.\" No one knew\ntill change reached a sufficient speed.<br/><br/>Large organizations <i>will</i> start to do worse now, though,\nbecause for the first time in history they're no longer getting the\nbest people.  An ambitious kid graduating from college now doesn't\nwant to work for a big company.  They want to work for the hot\nstartup that's rapidly growing into one.  If they're really ambitious,\nthey want to start it. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/highres.html#f2n\"><font color=\"#999999\">2</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>This doesn't mean big companies will disappear.  To say that\nstartups will succeed implies that big companies will exist, because\nstartups that succeed either become big companies or are acquired\nby them. \n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/highres.html#f3n\"><font color=\"#999999\">3</font></a>]</font>\nBut large organizations will probably never again\nplay the leading role they did up till the last quarter of the\ntwentieth century.<br/><br/>It's kind of surprising that a trend that lasted so long would ever\nrun out.  How often does it happen that a rule works for thousands\nof years, then switches polarity?<br/><br/>The millennia-long run of bigger-is-better left us with a lot of\n<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/credentials.html\">traditions</a> that are now obsolete, \nbut extremely deeply rooted.\nWhich means the ambitious can now do arbitrage on them.  It will\nbe very valuable to understand precisely which ideas to keep and\nwhich can now be discarded.<br/><br/>The place to look is where the spread of smallness began: in the\nworld of startups.<br/><br/>There have always been occasional cases, particularly in the US,\nof ambitious people who grew the ladder under them instead of\nclimbing it.  But till recently this was an anomalous route that\ntended to be followed only by outsiders.  It was no coincidence\nthat the great industrialists of the nineteenth century had so\nlittle formal education.  As huge as their companies eventually\nbecame, they were all essentially mechanics and shopkeepers at\nfirst.  That was a social step no one with a college education would\ntake if they could avoid it.  Till the rise of technology startups,\nand in particular, Internet startups, it was very unusual for\neducated people to start their own businesses.<br/><br/>The eight men who left Shockley Semiconductor to found Fairchild\nSemiconductor, the original Silicon Valley startup, weren't even\ntrying to start a company at first.  They were just looking for a\ncompany willing to hire them as a group.  Then one of their parents\nintroduced them to a small investment bank that offered to find\nfunding for them to start their own, so they did.  But starting a\ncompany was an alien idea to them; it was something they backed\ninto.\n<font color=\"#999999\">[<a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/highres.html#f4n\"><font color=\"#999999\">4</font></a>]</font><br/><br/>Now I would guess that practically every Stanford or Berkeley\nundergrad who knows how to program has at least considered the idea\nof starting a startup.  East Coast universities are not far behind,\nand British universities only a little behind them.  This pattern\nsuggests that attitudes at Stanford and Berkeley are not an anomaly,\nbut a leading indicator.  This is the way the world is going.<br/><br/>Of course, Internet startups are still only a fraction of the world's\neconomy.  Could a trend based on them be that powerful?<br/><br/>I think so.  There's no reason to suppose there's any limit to the\namount of work that could be done in this area.  Like science,\nwealth seems to expand fractally.  Steam power was a sliver of the\nBritish economy when Watt started working on it.  But his work led\nto more work till that sliver had expanded into something bigger\nthan the whole economy of which it had initially been a part.<br/><br/>The same thing could happen with the Internet.  If Internet startups\noffer the best opportunity for ambitious people, then a lot of\nambitious people will start them, and this bit of the economy will\nballoon in the usual fractal way.<br/><br/>Even if Internet-related applications only become a tenth of the\nworld's economy, this component will set the tone for the rest.\nThe most dynamic part of the economy always does, in everything\nfrom salaries to standards of dress.  Not just because of its\nprestige, but because the principles underlying the most dynamic\npart of the economy tend to be ones that work.<br/><br/>For the future, the trend to bet on seems to be networks of small,\nautonomous groups whose performance is measured individually.  And\nthe societies that win will be the ones with the least impedance.<br/><br/>As with the original industrial revolution, some societies are going\nto be better at this than others.  Within a generation of its birth\nin England, the Industrial Revolution had spread to continental\nEurope and North America.  But it didn't spread everywhere.  This\nnew way of doing things could only take root in places that were\nprepared for it.  It could only spread to places that already had\na vigorous middle class.<br/><br/>There is a similar social component to the transformation that began\nin Silicon Valley in the 1960s.  Two new kinds of techniques were\ndeveloped there: techniques for building integrated circuits, and\ntechniques for building a new type of company designed to grow fast\nby creating new technology.  The techniques for building integrated\ncircuits spread rapidly to other countries.  But the techniques for\nbuilding startups didn't.  Fifty years later, startups are ubiquitous\nin Silicon Valley and common in a handful of other US cities, but\nthey're still an anomaly in most of the world.<br/><br/>Part of the reason—possibly the main reason—that startups\nhave not spread as broadly as the Industrial Revolution did is their\nsocial disruptiveness.  Though it brought many social changes, the\nIndustrial Revolution was not fighting the principle that bigger\nis better.  Quite the opposite: the two dovetailed beautifully.\nThe new industrial companies adapted the customs of existing large\norganizations like the military and the civil service, and the\nresulting hybrid worked well.  \"Captains of industry\" issued orders\nto \"armies of workers,\" and everyone knew what they were supposed\nto do.<br/><br/>Startups seem to go more against the grain, socially.  It's hard\nfor them to flourish in societies that value hierarchy and stability,\njust as it was hard for industrialization to flourish in societies\nruled by people who stole at will from the merchant class.  But\nthere were already a handful of countries past that stage when the\nIndustrial Revolution happened.   There do not seem to be that many\nready this time.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Notes</b><br/><br/>[<a name=\"f1n\"><font color=\"#000000\">1</font></a>]\nOne of the bizarre consequences of this model was that the usual\nway to make more money was to become a manager.
