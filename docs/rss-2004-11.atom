November 2004, corrected June 2006&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Occam's razor says we should prefer the simpler of two explanations.
I begin by reminding readers of this principle because I'm about
to propose a theory that will offend both liberals and conservatives.
But Occam's razor means, in effect, that if you want to disagree
with it, you have a hell of a coincidence to explain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</content>

essay with the first version to see how much of the original  
text survives.

As E. B. White said, "good writing is rewriting."  I didn't
realize this when I was in school.  In writing, as in math and 
science, they only show you the finished product.
You don't see all the false starts.  This gives students a

because I worked at Yahoo during 1998 and 1999.  One day,
when the stock was trading around $200, I sat down and calculated
what I thought the price should be. The 
answer I got was $12.  I went to
the next cubicle and told my friend Trevor.  "Twelve!" he said.
He tried to sound indignant, but he didn't quite manage it.  &lt;/font&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;September 2004&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember the essays you had to write in high school?
Topic sentence, introductory paragraph,
supporting paragraphs, conclusion.  The conclusion being,
say, that Ahab in &lt;i&gt;Moby Dick&lt;/i&gt; was a Christ-like figure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oy.  So I'm going to try to give the other side of the
story: what an essay really is, and how you write one.
Or at least, how I write one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mods&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most obvious difference between real essays and

people: that you could get smarter programmers to work on
a Python project than you could to work on a Java project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I didn't mean by this that Java programmers are dumb.  I
meant that Python programmers are smart. It's a lot of
work to learn a new programming language.  And people don't
learn Python because it will get them a job; they le&lt;/font&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;May 2004&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When people care enough about something to do it well, those who
do it best tend to be far better than everyone else.  There's a
huge gap between Leonardo and second-rate contemporaries like
Borgognone.  You see the same gap between Raymond Chandler and the
average writer of detective novels.  A top-ranked professional chess
player could play ten thousand games against an ordinary club player
without losing once.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like chess or painting or &lt;/font&gt;</content>

    <title>The Word "Hacker"</title>

    <content>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;April 2004&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To the popular press, "hacker" means someone who breaks
into computers.  Among programmers it means a good programmer.
But the two meanings are connected.  To programmers,
"hacker" connotes mastery in the most literal sense: someone
who can make a computer do what he wantsâ€”whether the computer
wants to or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To add to the confusion, the noun "hack" also has two senses.  It can
be either a compliment or an insult.  It's called a hack wh&lt;/font&gt;</content>

correlation between popularity and quality.  Why does

life will be like in a hundred years.  There are only a few

    <content>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;February 2003&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When we were in junior high school, my friend Rich and I made a map
of the school lunch tables according to popularity. This was easy
to do, because kids only ate lunch with others of about the same
popularity. We graded them from A to E. A tables were full of
football players and cheerleaders and so on. E tables contained the
kids with mild cases of Down's Syndrome, what in the language of
the time we called "retards."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We sat at a D &lt;/font&gt;</content>

    <title>What Made Lisp Different</title>

    <content>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;December 2001 (rev. May 2002)
&lt;p align="justif"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;(This article came about in response to some questions on
the &lt;a href="http://ll1.mit.edu"&gt;LL1&lt;/a&gt; mailing list.  It is now
incorporated in &lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/icad.html"&gt;Revenge of the Nerds&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When McCarthy designed Lisp in the late 1950s, it was
a radical departure from existing languages,
the most important of which was &lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/history.html"&gt;Fortran&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</content>

    <title>The Other Road Ahead</title>

(This article explains why much of the next generation of software
may be server-based, what that will mean for programmers,
and why this new kind of software is a great opportunity for startups.
It's derived from a talk at BBN Labs.)
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the summer of 1995, my friend Robert Morris and I decided to
start a startup.  The PR campaign leading up to Netscape's IPO was
running full blast then, and there was a lot of talk in the pr&lt;/font&gt;</content>

    <title>The Roots of Lisp</title>
    <updated>2025-08-28T06:00:49.694087+00:00</updated>

&lt;p align="justif"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;(I wrote this article to help myself understand exactly
what McCarthy discovered.  You don't need to know this stuff
to program in Lisp, but it should be helpful to 
anyone who wants to
understand the essence of Lisp Â— both in the sense of its
origins and its semantic core.  The fact that it has such a core
is one of Lisp's distinguishing features, and the reason why,
unlike other languages, Lisp has dialects.)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1960, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</content>

    <title>Five Questions about Language Design</title>

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;(These are some notes I made
for a panel discussion on programming language design
at MIT on May 10, 2001.)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="18" hspace="0" src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/five-questions-about-language-design-18.gif" vspace="0" width="159"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;1.

    <content>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;May 2001&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;(This article was written as a kind of business plan for a
&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/arc.html"&gt;new language&lt;/a&gt;.
So it is missing (because it takes for granted) the most important
feature of a good programming language: very powerful abstractions.)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A friend of mine once told an eminent operating systems
expert that he wanted to design a really good
programming language.  The expert told him that it would be a

    <title>Java's Cover</title>

    <content>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;April 2001&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This essay developed out of conversations I've had with
several other programmers about why Java smelled suspicious.  It's not
a critique of Java!  It is a case study of hacker's radar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over time, hackers develop a nose for good (and bad) technology.
I thought it might be interesting to try and write down what
made Java seem suspect to me.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some people who've read this think it's an interesting attempt to write about
something th&lt;/font&gt;</content>

    <title>This Year We Can End the Death Penalty in California</title>
    <updated>2025-08-28T06:00:49.678981+00:00</updated>
    <content>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;November 2016&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you're a California voter, there is an important proposition
on your ballot this year: Proposition 62, which bans the death
penalty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When I was younger I used to think the debate about the death
penalty was about when it's ok to take a human life.  Is it ok
to kill a killer?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But that is not the issue here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The real world does not work like the version I was shown on TV growing up.  The police 
often arrest the wro&lt;/font&gt;</content>
