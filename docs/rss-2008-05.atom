    <content>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note: The strategy described at the end of this essay didn't work.
It would work for a while, and then I'd gradually find myself
using the Internet on my work computer.  I'm trying other
strategies now, but I think this time I'll wait till I'm sure
they work before writing about them.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;May 2008&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Procrastination feeds on distractions.  Most people find it
uncomfortable just to sit and do nothing; you avoid work by doing
something else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;May 2008&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adults lie constantly to kids.  I'm not saying we should stop, but
I think we should at least examine which lies we tell and why.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There may also be a benefit to us.  We were all lied to as kids,
and some of the lies we were told still affect us.  So by studying
the ways adults lie to kids, we may be able to clear our heads of
lies we were told.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I'm using the word "lie" in a very general sense: not just overt
falsehoods, but also a&lt;/font&gt;</content>

phrase that became our motto: Make something people want.  We've
learned a lot since then, but if I were choosing now that's still
the one I'd pick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another thing we tell founders is not to worry too much about the
business model, at least at first.  Not because making money is
unimportant, but b&lt;/font&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;April 2008&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are some topics I save up because they'll be so much fun to
write about.  This is one of them: a list of my heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I'm not claiming this is a list of the &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; most admirable people.
Who could make such a list, even if they wanted to?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Einstein isn't on the list, for example, even though he probably
deserves to be on any shortlist of admirable people.  I once asked
a physicist friend if Einstein was really as smart as h&lt;/font&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;March 2008&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The web is turning writing into a conversation.  Twenty years ago,
writers wrote and readers read.  The web lets readers respond, and
increasingly they do—in comment threads, on forums, and in their
own blog posts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many who respond to something disagree with it.  That's to be
expected.  Agreeing tends to motivate people less than disagreeing.
And when you agree there's less to say.  You could expand on something
the author said, but he h&lt;/font&gt;</content>

trying to understand its implications.)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
I was annoyed recently to read a description of Y Combinator that
said "Y Combinator does seed funding for startups."  What was
especially annoying about it was that I wrote it.  This doesn't
really convey what we do.  And the reason it's ina&lt;/font&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;February 2008&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A user on Hacker News recently posted a
&lt;a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=116938"&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt;
that set me thinking:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Something about hacker culture that never really set well with
  me was this  the nastiness. ... I just don't understand why people
  troll like they do.

I've thought a lot over the last couple years about the problem of
trolls.  It's an old one, as old as forums, but

an unexpected consequence: it made me realize I had a design
philosophy.  The main complaint of the more articulate critics was
that Arc seemed so flimsy. After years of working on it, all I had
to show for myself were a few thousand lines of macros?  Why hadn't
I worked on more substantial problems?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As I was mulling over these remarks it struck&lt;/font&gt;</content>

&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/webstartups.html"&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt; I gave, one of the organizers 
got up on the
stage to deliver an impromptu rebuttal.  That never happened before.
I only heard the first few sentences, but that was enough to tell
what I said that upset him: that startups would do better if they
moved to Silicon Valley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference was in London, and most of the audience seemed to
be from the UK.  So saying &lt;/font&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;September 2007&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In high school I decided I was going to study philosophy in college.
I had several motives, some more honorable than others.  One of the
less honorable was to shock people.  College was regarded as job
training where I grew up, so studying philosophy seemed an impressively
impractical thing to do.  Sort of like slashing holes in your clothes
or putting a safety pin through your ear, which were other forms
of impressive impracticality then jus&lt;/font&gt;</content>

me. It may not matter all that much where you go to college.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For me, as for a lot of middle class kids, getting into a good
college was more or less the meaning of life when I was growing up.
What was I?  A student.  To do that well meant to get good grades.
Why did one have to get good grades?  To get into a good college.

in his mind the way a mathematician holds a problem he's working
on.  Mathematicians don't answer questions by working them out on
paper the way schoolchildren are taught to.  They do more in their
heads: they try to understand a problem space well enough that they
can walk around it the way you can walk around the memory of the
house you grew up in.  At its best programming is th&lt;/font&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;July 2007&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have too much stuff.  Most people in America do.  In fact, the
poorer people are, the more stuff they seem to have.  Hardly anyone
is so poor that they can't afford a front yard full of old cars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It wasn't always this way.  Stuff used to be rare and valuable.
You can still see evidence of that if you look for it.  For example,
in my house in Cambridge, which was built in 1876, the bedrooms
don't have closets.  In those days people's stu&lt;/font&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;May 2007&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People who worry about the increasing gap between rich and poor
generally look back on the mid twentieth century as a golden age.
In those days we had a large number of high-paying union manufacturing
jobs that boosted the median income.  I wouldn't quite call the
high-paying union job a myth, but I think people who dwell on it
are reading too much into it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oddly enough, it was working with startups that made me realize

you correctly is the end goal.  But there's a second much more
common type of judgement where it isn't.  We tend to regard all
judgements of us as the first type.  We'd probably be happier if
we realized which are and which aren't.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first type of judgement, the type where judging you is the end
goal, include court cases, grades in classes, and most competitions.

    <title>Microsoft is Dead</title>

    <content>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;April 2007&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few days ago I suddenly realized Microsoft was dead.  I was talking
to a young startup founder about how Google was different from
Yahoo.  I said that Yahoo had been warped from the start by
their fear of Microsoft.  That was why they'd positioned themselves
as a "media company" instead of a technology company.  Then I looked
at his face and realized he didn't understand.  It was as if I'd
told him how much girls liked Barry Manilow in the mid

    <title>Is It Worth Being Wise?</title>
    <updated>2025-08-11T20:00:41.080316+00:00</updated>
    <content>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;February 2007&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few days ago I finally figured out something I've wondered about
for 25 years: the relationship between wisdom and intelligence.
Anyone can see they're not the same by the number of people who are
smart, but not very wise.  And yet intelligence and wisdom do seem
related.  How?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is wisdom?  I'd say it's knowing what to do in a lot of
situations.  I'm not trying to make a deep point here about the
true nature of wisdom, just to f&lt;/font&gt;</content>

blocks, and spend the rest of the race slowing down.  The winners
slow down the least.  It's that way with most startups too.  The
earliest phase is usually the most productive.  That's when they
have the really big ideas.  Imagine what Apple was like when&lt;/font&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;December 2006&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I grew up believing that taste is just a matter of personal preference.
Each person has things they like, but no one's preferences are any
better than anyone else's.  There is no such thing as &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; taste.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like a lot of things I grew up believing, this turns out to be
false, and I'm going to try to explain why.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One problem with saying there's no such thing as good taste is that
it also means there's no such thing as goo&lt;/font&gt;</content>
