      <content:encoded>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;January 2020&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;(I originally intended this for startup founders, who are often
surprised by the attention they get as their companies grow, but
it applies equally to anyone who becomes famous.)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you become sufficiently famous, you'll acquire some fans who
like you too much. These people are sometimes called "fanboys," and
though I dislike that term, I'm going to have to use it here.  We
need some word for them, because this is a distinct phenomenon from
someone simply liking your work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fanboy is obsessive and uncritical. Liking you becomes part of
their identity, and they create an image of you in their own head
that is much better than reality. Everything you do is good, because
you do it. If you do something bad, they find a way to see it as
good. And their love for you is not, usually, a quiet, private one.
They want everyone to know how great you are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, you may be thinking, I could do without this kind of obsessive
fan, but I know there are all kinds of people in the world, and if
this is the worst consequence of fame, that's not so bad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately this is not the worst consequence of fame. As well
as fanboys, you'll have haters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A hater is obsessive and uncritical. Disliking you becomes part of
their identity, and they create an image of you in their own head
that is much worse than reality. Everything you do is bad, because
you do it. If you do something good, they find a way to see it as
bad. And their dislike for you is not, usually, a quiet, private
one. They want everyone to know how awful you are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you're thinking of checking, I'll save you the trouble. The
second and fifth paragraphs are identical except for "good" being
switched to "bad" and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I spent years puzzling about haters.  What are they, and where do
they come from? Then one day it dawned on me. Haters are just fanboys
with the sign switched.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that by haters, I don't simply mean trolls. I'm not talking about 
people who say bad things about you and then move on. I'm talking
about the much smaller group of people for whom this becomes a 
kind of obsession and who do it repeatedly over a long period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like fans, haters seem to be an automatic consequence of fame.
Anyone sufficiently famous will have them. And like fans, haters
are energized by the fame of whoever they hate. They hear a song
by some pop singer. They don't like it much. If the singer were an
obscure one, they'd just forget about it. But instead they keep
hearing her name, and this seems to drive some people crazy.
Everyone's always going on about this singer, but she's no good!
She's a fraud!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That word "fraud" is an important one. It's the spectral signature
of a hater to regard the object of their hatred as a 
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=Musk%20fraud&amp;amp;src=typed_query&amp;amp;f=live"&gt;&lt;u&gt;fraud&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They
can't deny their fame. Indeed, their fame is if anything exaggerated
in the hater's mind. They notice every mention of the singer's name,
because every mention makes them angrier. In their own minds they
exaggerate both the singer's fame and her lack of talent, and the
only way to reconcile those two ideas is to conclude that she has
tricked everyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What sort of people become haters? Can anyone become one? I'm not
sure about this, but I've noticed some patterns. Haters are generally
losers in a very specific sense: although they are occasionally
talented, they have never achieved much. And indeed, anyone
successful enough to have achieved significant fame would be unlikely
to regard another famous person as a fraud on that account, because
anyone famous knows how random fame is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But haters are not always complete losers. They are not always the
proverbial guy living in his mom's basement. Many are, but some
have some amount of talent. In fact I suspect that a sense of
frustrated talent is what drives some people to become haters.
They're not just saying "It's unfair that so-and-so is famous," but
"It's unfair that so-and-so is famous, and not me."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Could a hater be cured if they achieved something impressive? My
guess is that's a moot point, because they 
&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/mean.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;never will&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I've been
able to observe for long enough that I'm fairly confident the pattern
works both ways: not only do people who do great work never become
haters, haters never do great work. Although I dislike the word
"fanboy," it's evocative of something important about both haters
and fanboys. It implies that the fanboy is so slavishly predictable in his admiration
that he's diminished as a result, that he's less than a man.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Haters seem even more diminished. I can imagine being a fanboy.
I can think of people whose work I admire so much that I could abase
myself before them out of sheer gratitude. If P. G.  Wodehouse were
still alive, I could see myself being a Wodehouse fanboy. But I
could not imagine being a hater.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knowing that haters are just fanboys with the sign bit flipped makes
it much easier to deal with them. We don't need a separate theory
of haters. We can just use existing techniques for dealing with
obsessive fans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most important of which is simply not to think much about them.
If you're like most people who become famous enough to acquire
haters, your initial reaction will be one of mystification. Why
does this guy seem to have it in for me? Where does his obsessive
energy come from, and what makes him so appallingly nasty? What did
I do to set him off? Is it something I can fix?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mistake here is to think of the hater as someone you have a
dispute with. When you have a dispute with someone, it's usually a
good idea to try to understand why they're upset and then fix things
if you can. Disputes are distracting. But it's a false analogy to
think of a hater as someone you have a dispute with.  It's an
understandable mistake, if you've never encountered haters before.
But when you realize that you're dealing with a hater, and what a
hater is, it's clear that it's a waste of time even to think about
them. If you have obsessive fans, do you spend any time wondering
what makes them love you so much? No, you just think "some
people are kind of crazy," and that's the end of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since haters are equivalent to fanboys, that's the way to deal with
them too. There may have been something that set them off. But it's
not something that would have set off a normal person, so there's
no reason to spend any time thinking about it. It's not you, it's
them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[1] There are of course some people who are genuine frauds. How can
you distinguish between x calling y a fraud because x is a hater,
and because y is a fraud? Look at neutral opinion. Actual frauds
are usually pretty conspicuous. Thoughtful people are rarely taken
in by them. So if there are some thoughtful people who like y, you
can usually assume y is not a fraud.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[2] I would make an exception for teenagers, who sometimes act in
such extreme ways that they are literally not themselves. I can
imagine a teenage kid being a hater and then growing out of it. But
not anyone over 25.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[3] I have a much worse memory for misdeeds than my wife Jessica,
who is a connoisseur of character, but I don't wish it were better.
Most disputes are a waste of time even if you're in the right, and
it's easy to bury the hatchet with someone if you can't remember
why you were mad at them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[4] A competent hater will not merely attack you individually but
will try to get mobs after you. In some cases you may want to refute
whatever bogus claim they made in order to do so. But err on the
side of not, because ultimately it probably won't matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color="888888"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thanks&lt;/b&gt; to Austen Allred, Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison,

      <title>The Two Kinds of Moderate</title>
      <link>https://paulgraham.com//mod.html</link>
      <description>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;December 2019&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two distinct ways to be politically moderate: on purpose
and by accident. Intentional moderates are trimmers, deliberately
choosing a position mid-way between the extremes of right and left.
Accidental moderates end up in the middle, on average, because they
make up their own minds about each question, and the far right and
far left are roughly equally wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can distinguish intentional from accidental moderates by the

      <content:encoded>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;December 2019&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two distinct ways to be politically moderate: on purpose
and by accident. Intentional moderates are trimmers, deliberately
choosing a position mid-way between the extremes of right and left.
Accidental moderates end up in the middle, on average, because they
make up their own minds about each question, and the far right and
far left are roughly equally wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can distinguish intentional from accidental moderates by the
distribution of their opinions. If the far left opinion on some
matter is 0 and the far right opinion 100, an intentional moderate's
opinion on every question will be near 50. Whereas an accidental
moderate's opinions will be scattered over a broad range, but will,
like those of the intentional moderate, average to about 50.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intentional moderates are similar to those on the far left and the
far right in that their opinions are, in a sense, not their own.
The defining quality of an ideologue, whether on the left or the
right, is to acquire one's opinions in bulk. You don't get to pick
and choose. Your opinions about taxation can be predicted from your
opinions about sex. And although intentional moderates
might seem to be the opposite of ideologues, their beliefs (though
in their case the word "positions" might be more accurate) are also
acquired in bulk. If the median opinion shifts to the right or left,
the intentional moderate must shift with it. Otherwise they stop
being moderate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Accidental moderates, on the other hand, not only choose their own
answers, but choose their own questions. They may not care at all
about questions that the left and right both think are terribly
important. So you can only even measure the politics of an accidental
moderate from the intersection of the questions they care about and
those the left and right care about, and this can
sometimes be vanishingly small.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is not merely a manipulative rhetorical trick to say "if you're
not with us, you're against us," but often simply false.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moderates are sometimes derided as cowards, particularly by 
the extreme left. But while it may be accurate to call intentional
moderates cowards, openly being an accidental moderate requires the
most courage of all, because you get attacked from both right and
left, and you don't have the comfort of being an orthodox member
of a large group to sustain you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nearly all the most impressive people I know are accidental moderates.
If I knew a lot of professional athletes, or people in the entertainment
business, that might be different. Being on the far left or far
right doesn't affect how fast you run or how well you sing. But
someone who works with ideas has to be independent-minded to do it
well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or more precisely, you have to be independent-minded about the ideas
you work with. You could be mindlessly doctrinaire in your politics
and still be a good mathematician. In the 20th century, a lot of
very smart people were Marxists  just no one who was smart about
the subjects Marxism involves. But if the ideas you use in your
work intersect with the politics of your time, you have two choices:
be an accidental moderate, or be mediocre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[1] It's possible in theory for one side to be entirely right and
the other to be entirely wrong. Indeed, ideologues must always
believe this is the case. But historically it rarely has been.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[2] For some reason the far right tend to ignore moderates rather
than despise them as backsliders. I'm not sure why. Perhaps it
means that the far right is less ideological than the far left. Or
perhaps that they are more confident, or more resigned, or simply
more disorganized. I just don't know.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[3] Having heretical opinions doesn't mean you have to express
them openly. It may be
&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/say.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;easier to have them&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; if you don't.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

      <title>Fashionable Problems</title>
      <link>https://paulgraham.com//fp.html</link>
      <description>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;December 2019&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I've seen the same pattern in many different fields: even though
lots of people have worked hard in the field, only a small fraction
of the space of possibilities has been explored, because they've
all worked on similar things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even the smartest, most imaginative people are surprisingly
conservative when deciding what to work on. People who would never
dream of being fashionable in any other way get sucked into working
on fashionable &lt;/font&gt;</description>

conservative when deciding what to work on. People who would never
dream of being fashionable in any other way get sucked into working
on fashionable problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you want to try working on unfashionable problems, one of the
best places to look is in fields that people think have already been
fully explored: essays, Lisp, venture funding  you may notice a
pattern here. If you can find a new approach into a big but apparently
played out field, the value of whatever you discover will be
&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/sun.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;multiplied&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by its enormous surface area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The best protection against getting drawn into working on the same
things as everyone else may be to &lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/genius.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;genuinely 
love&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; what you're doing.
Then you'll continue to work on it even if you make the same mistake
as other people and think that it's too marginal to matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Having Kids</title>
      <link>https://paulgraham.com//kids.html</link>
      <description>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;December 2019&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before I had kids, I was afraid of having kids. Up to that point I
felt about kids the way the young Augustine felt about living
virtuously. I'd have been sad to think I'd never have children.
But did I want them now? No.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If I had kids, I'd become a parent, and parents, as I'd known since
I was a kid, were uncool. They were dull and responsible and had
no fun.  And while it's not surprising that kids would believe that,
to be honest I&lt;/font&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;December 2019&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before I had kids, I was afraid of having kids. Up to that point I
felt about kids the way the young Augustine felt about living
virtuously. I'd have been sad to think I'd never have children.
But did I want them now? No.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If I had kids, I'd become a parent, and parents, as I'd known since
I was a kid, were uncool. They were dull and responsible and had
no fun.  And while it's not surprising that kids would believe that,
to be honest I hadn't seen much as an adult to change my mind.
Whenever I'd noticed parents with kids, the kids seemed to be
terrors, and the parents pathetic harried creatures, even when they
prevailed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When people had babies, I congratulated them enthusiastically,
because that seemed to be what one did. But I didn't feel it at
all.  "Better you than me," I was thinking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now when people have babies I congratulate them enthusiastically and
I mean it. Especially the first one. I feel like they just got the best gift in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What changed, of course, is that I had kids. Something I dreaded
turned out to be wonderful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partly, and I won't deny it, this is because of serious chemical
changes that happened almost instantly when our first child was
born.  It was like someone flipped a switch. I suddenly felt
protective not just toward our child, but toward all children. As I was
driving my wife and new son home from the hospital, I approached a
crosswalk full of pedestrians, and I found myself thinking "I have
to be really careful of all these people. Every one of them is
someone's child!"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So to some extent you can't trust me when I say having kids is
great.  To some extent I'm like a religious cultist telling you
that you'll be happy if you join the cult too  but only because
joining the cult will alter your mind in a way that will make you
happy to be a cult member.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But not entirely. There were some things
about having kids that I clearly got wrong before I had them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example, there was a huge amount of selection bias in my
observations of parents and children. Some parents may have noticed
that I wrote "Whenever I'd noticed parents with kids." Of course
the times I noticed kids were when things were going wrong. I only
noticed them when they made noise. And where was I when I noticed
them?  Ordinarily I never went to places with kids, so the only
times I encountered them were in shared bottlenecks like airplanes.
Which is not exactly a representative sample. Flying with a toddler
is something very few parents enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What I didn't notice, because they tend to be much quieter, were
all the great moments parents had with kids. People don't talk about
these much  the magic is hard to put into words, and all other
parents know about them anyway  but one of the great things about
having kids is that there are so many times when you feel there is
nowhere else you'd rather be, and nothing else you'd rather be
doing.  You don't have to be doing anything special. You could just
be going somewhere together, or putting them to bed, or pushing
them on the swings at the park. But you wouldn't trade these moments
for anything. One doesn't tend to associate kids with peace, but
that's what you feel.  You don't need to look any
further than where you are right now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before I had kids, I had moments of this kind of peace, but they
were rarer. With kids it can happen several times a day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My other source of data about kids was my own childhood, and that
was similarly misleading. I was pretty bad, and was always in trouble
for something or other. So it seemed to me that parenthood was
essentially law enforcement.  I didn't realize there were good times
too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I remember my mother telling me once when I was about 30 that she'd
really enjoyed having me and my sister. My god, I thought, this
woman is a saint. She not only endured all the pain we subjected
her to, but actually enjoyed it? Now I realize she was simply telling
the truth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She said that one reason she liked having us was that we'd been
interesting to talk to. That took me by surprise when I had kids.
You don't just love them. They become your friends too. They're
really interesting. And while I admit small children are disastrously
fond of repetition (anything worth doing once is worth doing fifty
times) it's often genuinely fun to play with them.  That surprised
me too. Playing with a 2 year old was fun when I was 2 and definitely
not fun when I was 6. Why would it become fun again later? But it
does.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are of course times that are pure drudgery. Or worse still,
terror. Having kids is one of those intense types of experience
that are hard to imagine unless you've had them. But it is not, as I
implicitly believed before having kids, simply your DNA heading for
the lifeboats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of my worries about having kids were right, though. They
definitely make you less productive. I know having kids makes some
people get their act together, but if your act was already together,
you're going to have less time to do it in. In particular, you're
going to have to work to a schedule. Kids have schedules.  I'm not
sure if it's because that's how kids are, or because it's the only
way to integrate their lives with adults', but once you have kids,
you tend to have to work on their schedule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will have chunks of time to work. But you can't let work spill
promiscuously through your whole life, like I used to before I had
kids. You're going to have to work at the same time every day,
whether inspiration is flowing or not, and there are going to be
times when you have to stop, even if it is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I've been able to adapt to working this way. Work, like love, finds
a way. If there are only certain times it can happen, it happens
at those times. So while I don't get as much done as before I had
kids, I get enough done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I hate to say this, because being ambitious has always been a part
of my identity, but having kids may make one less ambitious. It
hurts to see that sentence written down. I squirm to avoid it. But
if there weren't something real there, why would I squirm?  The
fact is, once you have kids, you're probably going to care more
about them than you do about yourself. And attention is a zero-sum
game. Only one idea at a time can be the 
&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/top.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;top idea in your mind&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
Once you have kids, it will often be your kids, and that means it
will less often be some project you're working on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have some hacks for sailing close to this wind. For example, when
I write essays, I think about what I'd want my kids to know. That
drives me to get things right. And when I was writing 
&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/bel.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bel&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I told
my kids that once I finished it I'd take them to Africa. When you
say that sort of thing to a little kid, they treat it as a promise.
Which meant I had to finish or I'd be taking away their trip to
Africa.  Maybe if I'm really lucky such tricks could put me net
ahead. But the wind is there, no question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the other hand, what kind of wimpy ambition do you have if it
won't survive having kids? Do you have so little to spare?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And while having kids may be warping my present judgement, it hasn't
overwritten my memory. I remember perfectly well what life was like
before. Well enough to miss some things a lot, like the
ability to take off for some other country at a moment's notice.
That was so great. Why did I never do that?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;See what I did there? The fact is, most of the freedom I had before
kids, I never used. I paid for it in loneliness, but I never used
it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I had plenty of happy times before I had kids. But if I count up
happy moments, not just potential happiness but actual happy moments,
there are more after kids than before. Now I practically have it
on tap, almost any bedtime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People's experiences as parents
vary a lot, and I know I've been lucky. But I think the worries I
had before having kids must be pretty common, and judging by other
parents' faces when they see their kids, so must the happiness that
kids bring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

fascinatingly complex characters they are, whereas to most 6 year
olds, 2 year olds are just defective 6 year olds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thanks&lt;/b&gt; to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris

      <content:encoded>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;December 2019&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The most damaging thing you learned in school wasn't something you
learned in any specific class. It was learning to get good grades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When I was in college, a particularly earnest philosophy grad student
once told me that he never cared what grade he got in a class, only
what he learned in it. This stuck in my mind because it was the
only time I ever heard anyone say such a thing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For me, as for most students, the measurement of what I was learning
completely dominated actual learning in college.  I was fairly
earnest; I was genuinely interested in most of the classes I took,
and I worked hard. And yet I worked by far the hardest when I was
studying for a test.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In theory, tests are merely what their name implies: tests of what
you've learned in the class. In theory you shouldn't have to prepare
for a test in a class any more than you have to prepare for a blood
test. In theory you learn from taking the class, from going to the
lectures and doing the reading and/or assignments, and the test
that comes afterward merely measures how well you learned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In practice, as almost everyone reading this will know, things are
so different that hearing this explanation of how classes and tests
are meant to work is like hearing the etymology of a word whose
meaning has changed completely. In practice, the phrase "studying
for a test" was almost redundant, because that was when one really
studied.  The difference between diligent and slack students was
that the former studied hard for tests and the latter didn't.  No
one was pulling all-nighters two weeks into the semester.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even though I was a diligent student, almost all the work I did in
school was aimed at getting a good grade on something.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To many people, it would seem strange that the preceding sentence
has a "though" in it. Aren't I merely stating a tautology? Isn't
that what a diligent student is, a straight-A student? That's how
deeply the conflation of learning with grades has infused our
culture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is it so bad if learning is conflated with grades?  Yes, it is bad.
And it wasn't till decades after college, when I was running Y Combinator, that I realized how bad it is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I knew of course when I was a student that studying for a test is
far from identical with actual learning. At the very least, you
don't retain knowledge you cram into your head the night before an
exam. But the problem is worse than that. The real problem is that
most tests don't come close to measuring what they're supposed to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If tests truly were tests of learning, things wouldn't be so bad.
Getting good grades and learning would converge, just a little late.
The problem is that nearly all tests given to students are terribly
hackable. Most people who've gotten good grades know this, and know
it so well they've ceased even to question it.  You'll see when you
realize how naive it sounds to act otherwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suppose you're taking a class on medieval history and the final
exam is coming up. The final exam is supposed to be a test of your
knowledge of medieval history, right? So if you have a couple days
between now and the exam, surely the best way to spend the time,
if you want to do well on the exam, is to read the best books you
can find about medieval history. Then you'll know a lot about it,
and do well on the exam.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No, no, no, experienced students are saying to themselves.  If you
merely read good books on medieval history, most of the stuff you
learned wouldn't be on the test.  It's not good books you want to
read, but the lecture notes and assigned reading in this class.
And even most of that you can ignore, because you only have to worry
about the sort of thing that could turn up as a test question.
You're looking for sharply-defined chunks of information. If one
of the assigned readings has an interesting digression on some
subtle point, you can safely ignore that, because it's not the sort
of thing that could be turned into a test question.  But if the
professor tells you that there were three underlying causes of the
Schism of 1378, or three main consequences of the Black Death, you'd
better know them. And whether they were in fact the causes or
consequences is beside the point.  For the purposes of this class
they are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At a university there are often copies of old exams floating around,
and these narrow still further what you have to learn. As well as
learning what kind of questions this professor asks, you'll often
get actual exam questions. Many professors re-use them.  After
teaching a class for 10 years, it would be hard not to, at least
inadvertently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In some classes, your professor will have had some sort of political
axe to grind, and if so you'll have to grind it too. The need for
this varies. In classes in math or the hard sciences or engineering
it's rarely necessary, but at the other end of the spectrum there
are classes where you couldn't get a good grade without it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Getting a good grade in a class on x is so different from learning
a lot about x that you have to choose one or the other, and you
can't blame students if they choose grades.  Everyone judges them
by their grades  graduate programs, employers, scholarships, even
their own parents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I liked learning, and I really enjoyed some of the papers and
programs I wrote in college. But did I ever, after turning in a
paper in some class, sit down and write another just for fun? Of
course not. I had things due in other classes. If it ever came to
a choice of learning or grades, I chose grades. I hadn't come to
college to do badly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyone who cares about getting good grades has to play this game,
or they'll be surpassed by those who do. And at elite universities,
that means nearly everyone, since someone who didn't care about
getting good grades probably wouldn't be there in the first place.
The result is that students compete to maximize the difference
between learning and getting good grades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why are tests so bad? More precisely, why are they so hackable?
Any experienced programmer could answer that. How hackable is
software whose author hasn't paid any attention to preventing it
from being hacked? Usually it's as porous as a colander.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hackable is the default for any test imposed by an authority. The
reason the tests you're given are so consistently bad  so consistently
far from measuring what they're supposed to measure  is simply
that the people creating them haven't made much effort to prevent
them from being hacked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But you can't blame teachers if their tests are hackable. Their job
is to teach, not to create unhackable tests. The real problem is
grades, or more precisely, that grades have been overloaded. If
grades were merely a way for teachers to tell students what they
were doing right and wrong, like a coach giving advice to an athlete,
students wouldn't be tempted to hack tests. But unfortunately after
a certain age grades become more than advice. After a certain age,
whenever you're being taught, you're usually also being judged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I've used college tests as an example, but those are actually the
least hackable. All the tests most students take their whole lives
are at least as bad, including, most spectacularly of all, the test
that gets them into college. If getting into college were merely a
matter of having the quality of one's mind measured by admissions
officers the way scientists measure the mass of an object, we could
tell teenage kids "learn a lot" and leave it at that.  You can tell
how bad college admissions are, as a test, from how unlike high
school that sounds. In practice, the freakishly specific nature of
the stuff ambitious kids have to do in high school is directly
proportionate to the hackability of college admissions.  The classes
you don't care about that are mostly memorization, the random
"extracurricular activities" you have to participate in to show
you're "well-rounded," the standardized tests as artificial as
chess, the "essay" you have to write that's presumably meant to hit
some very specific target, but you're not told what.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As well as being bad in what it does to kids, this test is also bad
in the sense of being very hackable. So hackable that whole industries
have grown up to hack it. This is the explicit purpose of test-prep
companies and admissions counsellors, but it's also a significant
part of the function of private schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why is this particular test so hackable? I think because of what
it's measuring. Although the popular story is that the way to get
into a good college is to be really smart, admissions officers at
elite colleges neither are, nor claim to be, looking only for that.
What are they looking for?  They're looking for people who are not
simply smart, but admirable in some more general sense.  And how
is this more general admirableness measured?  The admissions officers
feel it. In other words, they accept who they like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So what college admissions is a test of is whether you suit the
taste of some group of people. Well, of course a test like that is
going to be hackable. And because it's both very hackable and there's
(thought to be) a lot at stake, it's hacked like nothing else.
That's why it distorts your life so much for so long.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's no wonder high school students often feel alienated. The shape
of their lives is completely artificial.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But wasting your time is not the worst thing the educational system
does to you. The worst thing it does is to train you that the way
to win is by hacking bad tests.  This is a much subtler problem
that I didn't recognize until I saw it happening to other people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When I started advising startup founders at Y Combinator, especially
young ones, I was puzzled by the way they always seemed to make
things overcomplicated. How, they would ask, do you raise money?
What's the trick for making venture capitalists want to invest in
you? The best way to make VCs want to invest in you, I would explain,
is to actually be a good investment. Even if you could trick VCs
into investing in a bad startup, you'd be tricking yourselves too.
You're investing time in the same company you're asking them to
invest money in. If it's not a good investment, why are you even
doing it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh, they'd say, and then after a pause to digest this revelation,
they'd ask: What makes a startup a good investment?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So I would explain that what makes a startup promising, not just
in the eyes of investors but in fact, is 
&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/growth.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;growth&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  
Ideally in revenue,
but failing that in usage. What they needed to do was get lots of
users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How does one get lots of users? They had all kinds of ideas about
that. They needed to do a big launch that would get them "exposure."
They needed influential people to talk about them. They even knew
they needed to launch on a tuesday, because that's when one gets
the most attention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No, I would explain, that is not how to get lots of users. The way
you get lots of users is to make the product really great. Then
people will not only use it but recommend it to their friends, so
your growth will be exponential once you 
&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/ds.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;get it started&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At this point I've told the founders something you'd think would
be completely obvious: that they should make a good company by
making a good product. And yet their reaction would be something
like the reaction many physicists must have had when they first
heard about the theory of relativity: a mixture of astonishment at
its apparent genius, combined with a suspicion that anything so
weird couldn't possibly be right. Ok, they would say, dutifully.
And could you introduce us to such-and-such influential person? And
remember, we want to launch on Tuesday.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It would sometimes take founders years to grasp these simple lessons.
And not because they were lazy or stupid. They just seemed blind
to what was right in front of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why, I would ask myself, do they always make things so complicated?
And then one day I realized this was not a rhetorical question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why did founders tie themselves in knots doing the wrong things
when the answer was right in front of them? Because that was what
they'd been trained to do. Their education had taught them that the
way to win was to hack the test. And without even telling them they
were being trained to do this. The younger ones, the recent graduates,
had never faced a non-artificial test. They thought this was just
how the world worked: that the first thing you did, when facing any
kind of challenge, was to figure out what the trick was for hacking
the test. That's why the conversation would always start with how
to raise money, because that read as the test. It came at the end
of YC. It had numbers attached to it, and higher numbers seemed to
be better. It must be the test.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are certainly big chunks of the world where the way to win
is to hack the test. This phenomenon isn't limited to schools.  And
some people, either due to ideology or ignorance, claim that this
is true of startups too. But it isn't. In fact, one of the most
striking things about startups is the degree to which you win by
simply doing good work. There are edge cases, as there are in
anything, but in general you win by getting users, and what users
care about is whether the product does what they want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why did it take me so long to understand why founders made startups
overcomplicated? Because I hadn't realized explicitly that schools
train us to win by hacking bad tests. And not just them, but me!
I'd been trained to hack bad tests too, and hadn't realized it till
decades later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I had lived as if I realized it, but without knowing why. For
example, I had avoided working for big companies. But if you'd asked
why, I'd have said it was because they were bogus, or bureaucratic.
Or just yuck. I never understood how much of my dislike of big
companies was due to the fact that you win by hacking bad tests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similarly, the fact that the tests were unhackable was a lot of
what attracted me to startups. But again, I hadn't realized that
explicitly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I had in effect achieved by successive approximations something
that may have a closed-form solution.  I had gradually undone my
training in hacking bad tests without knowing I was doing it.  Could
someone coming out of school banish this demon just by knowing its
name, and saying begone? It seems worth trying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Merely talking explicitly about this phenomenon is likely to make
things better, because much of its power comes from the fact that
we take it for granted. After you've noticed it, it seems the
elephant in the room, but it's a pretty well camouflaged elephant.
The phenomenon is so old, and so pervasive. And it's simply the
result of neglect. No one meant things to be this way. This is just
what happens when you combine learning with grades, competition,
and the naive assumption of unhackability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was mind-blowing to realize that two of the things I'd puzzled
about the most  the bogusness of high school, and the difficulty
of getting founders to see the obvious  both had the same cause.
It's rare for such a big block to slide into place so late.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Usually when that happens it has implications in a lot of different
areas, and this case seems no exception. For example, it suggests
both that education could be done better, and how you might fix it.
But it also suggests a potential answer to the question all big
companies seem to have: how can we be more like a startup? I'm not
going to chase down all the implications now. What I want to focus
on here is what it means for individuals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start with, it means that most ambitious kids graduating from
college have something they may want to unlearn.  But it also changes
how you look at the world. Instead of looking at all the different
kinds of work people do and thinking of them vaguely as more or
less appealing, you can now ask a very specific question that will
sort them in an interesting way: to what extent do you win at this
kind of work by hacking bad tests?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It would help if there was a way to recognize bad tests quickly.
Is there a pattern here? It turns out there is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tests can be divided into two kinds: those that are imposed by
authorities, and those that aren't.  Tests that aren't imposed by
authorities are inherently unhackable, in the sense that no one is
claiming they're tests of anything more than they actually test. A
football match, for example, is simply a test of who wins, not which
team is better. You can tell that from the fact that commentators
sometimes say afterward that the better team won. Whereas tests
imposed by authorities are usually proxies for something else. A
test in a class is supposed to measure not just how well you did
on that particular test, but how much you learned in the class.
While tests that aren't imposed by authorities are inherently
unhackable, those imposed by authorities have to be made unhackable.
Usually they aren't.  So as a first approximation, bad tests are
roughly equivalent to tests imposed by authorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You might actually like to win by hacking bad tests. Presumably
some people do. But I bet most people who find themselves doing
this kind of work don't like it. They just take it for granted that
this is how the world works, unless you want to drop out and be
some kind of hippie artisan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I suspect many people implicitly assume that working in a
field with bad tests is the price of making lots of money. But that,
I can tell you, is false. It used to be true. In the mid-twentieth
century, when the economy was 
&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/re.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;composed of oligopolies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 
the only way
to the top was by playing their game. But it's not true now.  There
are now ways to get rich by doing good work, and that's part of the
reason people are so much more excited about getting rich than they
used to be. When I was a kid, you could either become an engineer
and make cool things, or make lots of money by becoming an "executive."
Now you can make lots of money by making cool things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hacking bad tests is becoming less important as the link between
work and authority erodes. The erosion of that link is one of the
most important trends happening now, and we see its effects in
almost every kind of work people do. Startups are one of the most
visible examples, but we see much the same thing in writing. Writers
no longer have to submit to publishers and editors to reach readers;
now they can go direct.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The more I think about this question, the more optimistic I get.
This seems one of those situations where we don't realize how much
something was holding us back until it's eliminated. And I can
foresee the whole bogus edifice crumbling. Imagine what happens as
more and more people start to ask themselves if they want to win
by hacking bad tests, and decide that they don't.  The kinds of
work where you win by hacking bad tests will be starved of talent,
and the kinds where you win by doing good work will see an influx
of the most ambitious people. And as hacking bad tests shrinks in
importance, education will evolve to stop training us to do it.
Imagine what the world could look like if that happened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not just a lesson for individuals to unlearn, but one for
society to unlearn, and we'll be amazed at the energy that's liberated
when we do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[1] If using tests only to measure learning sounds impossibly
utopian, that is already the way things work at Lambda School.
Lambda School doesn't have grades. You either graduate or you don't.
The only purpose of tests is to decide at each stage of the curriculum
whether you can continue to the next. So in effect the whole school
is pass/fail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[2] If the final exam consisted of a long conversation with the
professor, you could prepare for it by reading good books on medieval
history. A lot of the hackability of tests in schools is due to the
fact that the same test has to be given to large numbers of students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[3] Learning is the naive algorithm for getting good grades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[4] &lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/gba.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Hacking&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has 
multiple senses. There's a narrow sense in which
it means to compromise something. That's the sense in which one
hacks a bad test. But there's another, more general sense, meaning
to find a surprising solution to a problem, often by thinking
differently about it. Hacking in this sense is a wonderful thing.
And indeed, some of the hacks people use on bad tests are impressively
ingenious; the problem is not so much the hacking as that, because
the tests are hackable, they don't test what they're meant to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[5] The people who pick startups at Y Combinator are similar to
admissions officers, except that instead of being arbitrary, their
acceptance criteria are trained by a very tight feedback loop. If
you accept a bad startup or reject a good one, you will usually know it
within a year or two at the latest, and often within a month.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[6] I'm sure admissions officers are tired of reading applications
from kids who seem to have no personality beyond being willing to
seem however they're supposed to seem to get accepted.  What they
don't realize is that they are, in a sense, looking in a mirror.
The lack of authenticity in the applicants is a reflection of the
arbitrariness of the application process. A dictator might just as
well complain about the lack of authenticity in the people around
him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[7] By good work, I don't mean morally good, but good in the sense
in which a good craftsman does good work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[8] There are borderline cases where it's hard to say which category
a test falls in. For example, is raising venture capital like college
admissions, or is it like selling to a customer?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[9] Note that a good test is merely one that's unhackable. Good
here doesn't mean morally good, but good in the sense of working
well. The difference between fields with bad tests and good ones
is not that the former are bad and the latter are good, but that
the former are bogus and the latter aren't. But those two measures
are not unrelated.  As Tara Ploughman said, the path from good to
evil goes through bogus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[10] People who think the recent increase in 
&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/ineq.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;economic inequality&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is
due to changes in tax policy seem very naive to anyone with experience
in startups. Different people are getting rich now than used to,
and they're getting much richer than mere tax savings could make
them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[11] Note to tiger parents: you may think you're training your kids
to win, but if you're training them to win by hacking bad tests,
you are, as parents so often do, training them to fight the last
war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thanks&lt;/b&gt; to Austen Allred, Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison,
Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, and Harj Taggar for reading

      <title>Novelty and Heresy</title>

      <description>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;November 2019&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you discover something new, there's a significant chance you'll be
accused of some form of heresy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To discover new things, you have
to work on ideas that are good but non-obvious; if an idea is
obviously good, other people are probably already working on it.
One common way for a good idea to be non-obvious is for it to be hidden in the
shadow of some mistaken assumption that people are very attached to.
But anything you discover fr&lt;/font&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;November 2019&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you discover something new, there's a significant chance you'll be
accused of some form of heresy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To discover new things, you have
to work on ideas that are good but non-obvious; if an idea is
obviously good, other people are probably already working on it.
One common way for a good idea to be non-obvious is for it to be hidden in the
shadow of some mistaken assumption that people are very attached to.
But anything you discover from working on such an idea will tend to
contradict the mistaken assumption that was concealing it.  And you
will thus get a lot of heat from people attached to the mistaken
assumption. Galileo and Darwin are famous examples of this phenomenon,
but it's probably always an ingredient in the resistance to new
ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So it's particularly dangerous for an organization or society to
have a culture of pouncing on heresy.  When you suppress heresies,
you don't just prevent people from contradicting the mistaken
assumption you're trying to protect. You also suppress any idea
that implies indirectly that it's false.
&lt;!--
When you suppress heresy, you silence not just your opponents but
also everyone who contradicts you unintentionally.  And because
ideas are so interconnected, you're almost certainly silencing more
people than you realize. 
--&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every cherished mistaken assumption has
a dead zone of unexplored ideas around it.  And the more preposterous
the assumption, the bigger the dead zone it creates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a positive side to this phenomenon though.  If you're
looking for new ideas, one way to find them is by &lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/say.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;looking for
heresies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  When you look at the question this way, the depressingly
large dead zones around mistaken assumptions become excitingly large
mines of new ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>The Bus Ticket Theory of Genius</title>

      <description>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;November 2019&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone knows that to do great work you need both natural ability
and determination. But there's a third ingredient that's not as

      <content:encoded>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;November 2019&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone knows that to do great work you need both natural ability
and determination. But there's a third ingredient that's not as
well understood: an obsessive interest in a particular topic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To explain this point I need to burn my reputation with some group
of people, and I'm going to choose bus ticket collectors.  There
are people who collect old bus tickets. Like many collectors, they
have an obsessive interest in the minutiae of what they collect.
They can keep track of distinctions between different types of bus
tickets that would be hard for the rest of us to remember.  Because
we don't care enough. What's the point of spending so much time
thinking about old bus tickets?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Which leads us to the second feature of this kind of obsession:
there is no point. A bus ticket collector's love is disinterested.
They're not doing it to impress us or to make themselves rich, but
for its own sake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you look at the lives of people who've done great work, you
see a consistent pattern. They often begin with a bus ticket
collector's obsessive interest in something that would have seemed
pointless to most of their contemporaries. One of the most striking
features of Darwin's book about his voyage on the Beagle is the
sheer depth of his interest in natural history. His curiosity seems
infinite. Ditto for Ramanujan, sitting by the hour working out on
his slate what happens to series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a mistake to think they were "laying the groundwork" for the
discoveries they made later. There's too much intention in that
metaphor. Like bus ticket collectors, they were doing it
because they liked it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But there is a difference between Ramanujan and a bus ticket
collector. Series matter, and bus tickets don't.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If I had to put the recipe for genius into one sentence, that might
be it: to have a disinterested obsession with something that matters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aren't I forgetting about the other two ingredients? Less than you
might think. An obsessive interest in a topic is both a proxy for
ability and a substitute for determination.  Unless you have
sufficient mathematical aptitude, you won't find series interesting.
And when you're obsessively interested in something, you don't need
as much determination: you don't need to push yourself as hard when
curiosity is pulling you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An obsessive interest will even bring you luck, to the extent
anything can. Chance, as Pasteur said, favors the prepared mind,
and if there's one thing an obsessed mind is, it's prepared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The disinterestedness of this kind of obsession is its most important
feature. Not just because it's a filter for earnestness, but because
it helps you discover new ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The paths that lead to new ideas tend to look unpromising. If they
looked promising, other people would already have explored them.
How do the people who do great work discover these paths that others
overlook?  The popular story is that they simply have better vision:
because they're so talented, they see paths that others miss.  But
if you look at the way great discoveries are made, that's not what
happens. Darwin didn't pay closer attention to individual species
than other people because he saw that this would lead to great
discoveries, and they didn't. He was just really, really interested
in such things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Darwin couldn't turn it off. Neither could Ramanujan.  They didn't
discover the hidden paths that they did because they seemed promising,
but because they couldn't help it. That's what allowed them to
follow paths that someone who was merely ambitious would have
ignored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What rational person would decide that the way to write great novels
was to begin by spending several years creating an imaginary elvish
language, like Tolkien, or visiting every household in southwestern
Britain, like Trollope? No one, including Tolkien and Trollope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bus ticket theory is similar to Carlyle's famous definition of
genius as an infinite capacity for taking pains. But there are two
differences. The bus ticket theory makes it clear that the source
of this infinite capacity for taking pains is not infinite diligence,
as Carlyle seems to have meant, but the sort of infinite interest
that collectors have. It also adds an important qualification: an
infinite capacity for taking pains about something that matters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So what  matters? You can never be sure. It's precisely because no
one can tell in advance which paths are promising that you can
discover new ideas by working on what you're interested in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But there are some heuristics you can use to guess whether an
obsession might be one that matters. For example, it's more promising
if you're creating something, rather than just consuming something
someone else creates. It's more promising if something you're
interested in is difficult, especially if it's &lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/work.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;more difficult for
other people&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; than it is for you. And the obsessions of talented
people are more likely to be promising. When talented people become
interested in random things, they're not truly random.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But you can never be sure. In fact, here's an interesting idea
that's also rather alarming if it's true: it may be that to do great
work, you also have to waste a lot of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In many different areas, reward is proportionate to risk. If that
rule holds here, then the way to find paths that lead to truly great
work is to be willing to expend a lot of effort on things that turn
out to be every bit as unpromising as they seem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I'm not sure if this is true. On one hand, it seems surprisingly
difficult to waste your time so long as you're working hard on
something interesting. So much of what you do ends up being useful.
But on the other hand, the rule about the relationship between risk
and reward is so powerful that it seems to hold wherever risk occurs.
&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/disc.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Newton's&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; case, at least, suggests that the risk/reward rule holds
here. He's famous for one particular obsession of his that turned
out to be unprecedentedly fruitful: using math to describe the
world. But he had two other obsessions, alchemy and theology, that
seem to have been complete wastes of time. He ended up net ahead.
His bet on what we now call physics paid off so well that it more
than compensated for the other two. But were the other two necessary,
in the sense that he had to take big risks to make such big
discoveries? I don't know.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here's an even more alarming idea: might one make all bad bets?  It
probably happens quite often. But we don't know how often, because
these people don't become famous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's not merely that the returns from following a path are hard to
predict. They change dramatically over time. 1830 was a really good
time to be obsessively interested in natural history. If Darwin had
been born in 1709 instead of 1809, we might never have heard of
him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What can one do in the face of such uncertainty?  One solution is
to hedge your bets, which in this case means to follow the obviously
promising paths instead of your own private obsessions. But as with
any hedge, you're decreasing reward when you decrease risk.  If you
forgo working on what you like in order to follow some more
conventionally ambitious path, you might miss something wonderful
that you'd otherwise have discovered. That too must happen all the
time, perhaps even more often than the genius whose bets all fail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other solution is to let yourself be interested in lots of
different things. You don't decrease your upside if you switch
between equally genuine interests based on which seems to be working
so far. But there is a danger here too: if you work on too many
different projects, you might not get deeply enough into any of
them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One interesting thing about the bus ticket theory is that it may
help explain why different types of people excel at different kinds
of work. Interest is much more unevenly distributed than ability.
If natural ability is all you need to do great work, and natural
ability is evenly distributed, you have to invent elaborate theories
to explain the skewed distributions we see among those who actually
do great work in various fields. But it may be that much of the
skew has a simpler explanation: different people are interested in
different things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bus ticket theory also explains why people are less likely to
do great work after they have children. Here interest has to compete
not just with external obstacles, but with another interest, and
one that for most people is extremely powerful. It's harder to find
time for work after you have kids, but that's the easy part. The
real change is that you don't want to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the most exciting implication of the bus ticket theory is that
it suggests ways to encourage great work. If the recipe for genius
is simply natural ability plus hard work, all we can do is hope we
have a lot of ability, and work as hard as we can. But if interest
is a critical ingredient in genius, we may be able, by cultivating
interest, to cultivate genius.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example, for the very ambitious, the bus ticket theory suggests
that the way to do great work is to relax a little. Instead of
gritting your teeth and diligently pursuing what all your peers
agree is the most promising line of research, maybe you should try
doing something just for fun. And if you're stuck, that may be the
vector along which to break out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I've always liked &lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/hamming.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Hamming's&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; famous double-barrelled question: what
are the most important problems in your field, and why aren't you
working on one of them? It's a great way to shake yourself up. But
it may be overfitting a bit. It might be at least as useful to ask
yourself: if you could take a year off to work on something that
probably wouldn't be important but would be really interesting,
what would it be?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bus ticket theory also suggests a way to avoid slowing down as
you get older. Perhaps the reason people have fewer new ideas as
they get older is not simply that they're losing their edge. It may
also be because once you become established, you can no longer mess
about with irresponsible side projects the way you could when you
were young and no one cared what you did.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The solution to that is obvious: remain irresponsible. It will be
hard, though, because the apparently random projects you take up
to stave off decline will read to outsiders as evidence of it.  And
you yourself won't know for sure that they're wrong. But it will
at least be more fun to work on what you want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It may even be that we can cultivate a habit of intellectual bus
ticket collecting in kids. The usual plan in education is to start
with a broad, shallow focus, then gradually become more specialized.
But I've done the opposite with my kids. I know I can count on their
school to handle the broad, shallow part, so I take them deep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When they get interested in something, however random, I encourage
them to go preposterously, bus ticket collectorly, deep.  I don't
do this because of the bus ticket theory. I do it because I want
them to feel the joy of learning, and they're never going to feel
that about something I'm making them learn. It has to be something
they're interested in. I'm just following the path of least resistance;
depth is a byproduct. But if in trying to show them the joy of
learning I also end up training them to go deep, so much the better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will it have any effect? I have no idea. But that uncertainty may
be the most interesting point of all. There is so much more to learn
about how to do great work. As old as human civilization feels,
it's really still very young if we haven't nailed something so
basic. It's exciting to think there are still discoveries to make
about discovery. If that's the sort of thing you're interested in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[1] There are other types of collecting that illustrate this point
better than bus tickets, but they're also more popular. It seemed
just as well to use an inferior example rather than offend more
people by telling them their hobby doesn't matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[2] I worried a little about using the word "disinterested," since
some people mistakenly believe it means not interested. But anyone
who expects to be a genius will have to know the meaning of such a
basic word, so I figure they may as well start now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[3] Think how often genius must have been nipped in the bud by
people being told, or telling themselves, to stop messing about and
be responsible. Ramanujan's mother was a huge enabler. Imagine if
she hadn't been. Imagine if his parents had made him go out and get
a job instead of sitting around at home doing math.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the other hand, anyone quoting the preceding paragraph to justify
not getting a job is probably mistaken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[4] 1709 Darwin is to time what the &lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/cities.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Milanese Leonardo&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is to space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[5] "An infinite capacity for taking pains" is a paraphrase of what
Carlyle wrote. What he wrote, in his &lt;i&gt;History of Frederick the Great&lt;/i&gt;,
was "... it is the fruit of 'genius' (which means transcendent
capacity of taking trouble, first of all)...." Since the paraphrase
seems the name of the idea at this point, I kept it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carlyle's &lt;i&gt;History&lt;/i&gt; was published in 1858. In 1785 Hérault de Séchelles
quoted Buffon as saying "Le génie n'est qu'une plus grande aptitude
à la patience." (Genius is only a greater aptitude for patience.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[6] Trollope was establishing the system of postal routes. He himself
sensed the obsessiveness with which he pursued this goal.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
   It is amusing to watch how a passion will grow upon a man. During
   those two years it was the ambition of my life to cover the
   country with rural letter-carriers.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Even Newton occasionally sensed the degree of his obsessiveness.
After computing pi to 15 digits, he wrote in a letter to a friend:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
   I am ashamed to tell you to how many figures I carried these
   computations, having no other business at the time.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Incidentally, Ramanujan was also a compulsive calculator. As Kanigel
writes in his excellent biography:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  One Ramanujan scholar, B. M. Wilson, later told how Ramanujan's
  research into number theory was often "preceded by a table of
  numerical results, carried usually to a length from which most
  of us would shrink."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[7] Working to understand the natural world counts as creating
rather than consuming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Newton tripped over this distinction when he chose
to work on theology. His beliefs did not allow him to see it, but
chasing down paradoxes in nature is fruitful in a way that chasing
down paradoxes in sacred texts is not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[8] How much of people's propensity to become interested in a topic
is inborn?  My experience so far suggests the answer is: most of
it. Different kids get interested in different things, and it's
hard to make a child interested in something they wouldn't otherwise
be. Not in a way that sticks.  The most you can do on behalf of a
topic is to make sure it gets a fair showing  to make it clear to
them, for example, that there's more to math than the dull drills
they do in school. After that it's up to the child.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thanks&lt;/b&gt; to Marc Andreessen, Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison, Kevin

      <title>General and Surprising</title>

F = ma for example. But general and surprising is a hard
combination to achieve. That territory tends to be picked
clean, precisely because those insights are so valuable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ordinarily, the best that people can do is one without the

gossip), or general without being surprising (e.g.
platitudes).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where things get in&lt;/font&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;September 2017&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most valuable insights are both general and surprising. 
F = ma for example. But general and surprising is a hard
combination to achieve. That territory tends to be picked
clean, precisely because those insights are so valuable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ordinarily, the best that people can do is one without the
other: either surprising without being general (e.g.
gossip), or general without being surprising (e.g.
platitudes).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where things get interesting is the moderately valuable
insights.  You get those from small additions of whichever
quality was missing.  The more common case is a small
addition of generality: a piece of gossip that's more than
just gossip, because it teaches something interesting about
the world. But another less common approach is to focus on
the most general ideas and see if you can find something new
to say about them. Because these start out so general, you
only need a small delta of novelty to produce a useful
insight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A small delta of novelty is all you'll be able to get most
of the time. Which means if you take this route, your ideas
will seem a lot like ones that already exist. Sometimes
you'll find you've merely rediscovered an idea that did
already exist.  But don't be discouraged.  Remember the huge
multiplier that kicks in when you do manage to think of
something even a little new.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Corollary: the more general the ideas you're talking about,
the less you should worry about repeating yourself.  If you
write enough, it's inevitable you will.  Your brain is much
the same from year to year and so are the stimuli that hit
it. I feel slightly bad when I find I've said something
close to what I've said before, as if I were plagiarizing
myself. But rationally one shouldn't.  You won't say
something exactly the same way the second time, and that
variation increases the chance you'll get that tiny but
critical delta of novelty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And of course, ideas beget ideas.  (That sounds 
&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/ecw.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;familiar&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)
An idea with a small amount of novelty could lead to one
with more. But only if you keep going. So it's doubly
important not to let yourself be discouraged by people who
say there's not much new about something you've discovered.
"Not much new" is a real achievement when you're talking
about the most general ideas. &lt;!-- Maybe if you keep going,
you'll discover more. --&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's not true that there's nothing new under the sun.  There
are some domains where there's almost nothing new.  But
there's a big difference between nothing and almost nothing,
when it's multiplied by the area under the sun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Their power makes them a target for criticism that they don't have

The impression we get is that his unerring judgment
led him straight to truths no one else had noticed.
How to explain all the time he spent on alchemy
and theology?  Well, smart people are often kind of
crazy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But maybe there is a simpler explanation. Maybe
the smartness and the craziness were not as separate
as we think. Physics seems to us a promising thing
to work on, and alchemy and theology obvious wastes
of time. But that's because we know how things
turned out. In Newton's day the three problems 
seemed roughly equally promising. No one knew yet
what the payoff would be for inventing what we
now call physics; if they had, more people would 
have been working on it. And alchemy and theology
were still then in the category Marc Andreessen would 
describe as "huge, if true."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Newton made three bets. One of them worked. But 
they were all risky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</content:encoded>

most would-be startup hubs.)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What would it take to make Pittsburgh into a startup hub, like
Silicon Valley?  I understand Pittsburgh pretty well,
because I grew up here, in Monroeville. And I understand Silicon
Valley pretty well because that's where I live now.  Could you get
that kind of startup ecosystem going here?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When I agreed to speak here, I didn't think I'd be able to give a
very optimistic talk.  I thought I'd be talking about what Pittsburgh
could do to become a startup hub, very much in the subjunctive.
Instead I'm going to talk about what Pittsburgh can do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What changed my mind was an article I read in, of all places, the &lt;i&gt;New
York Times&lt;/i&gt; food section.  The title was "&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/dining/pittsburgh-restaurants.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Pittsburgh's Youth-Driven
Food Boom&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;."  To most people that might not even sound interesting,
let alone something related to startups.  But it was electrifying
to me to read that title.  I don't think I could pick a more promising
one if I tried.  And when I read the article I got even more excited.
It said "people ages 25 to 29 now make up 7.6 percent of all
residents, up from 7 percent about a decade ago."  Wow, I thought,
Pittsburgh could be the next Portland.  It could become the cool
place all the people in their twenties want to go live.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When I got here a couple days ago, I could feel the difference.  I
lived here from 1968 to 1984.  I didn't realize it at the time, but
during that whole period the city was in free fall. On top of the
flight to the suburbs that happened everywhere, the steel and nuclear
businesses were both dying. Boy are things different now.  It's not
just that downtown seems a lot more prosperous. There is an energy
here that was not here when I was a kid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When I was a kid, this was a place young people left. Now it's a
place that attracts them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What does that have to do with startups?  Startups are made
of people, and the average age of the people in a typical startup
is right in that 25 to 29 bracket.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I've seen how powerful it is for a city to have those people.  Five
years ago they shifted the center of gravity of Silicon Valley from
the peninsula to San Francisco.  Google and Facebook are on the
peninsula, but the next generation of big winners are all in SF.
The reason the center of gravity shifted was the talent war, for
programmers especially.  Most 25 to 29 year olds want to live in
the city, not down in the boring suburbs.  So whether they like it
or not, founders know they have to be in the city.  I know multiple
founders who would have preferred to live down in the Valley proper,
but who made themselves move to SF because they knew otherwise
they'd lose the talent war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So being a magnet for people in their twenties is a very promising
thing to be.  It's hard to imagine a place becoming a startup hub
without also being that.  When I read that statistic about the
increasing percentage of 25 to 29 year olds, I had exactly the same
feeling of excitement I get when I see a startup's graphs start to
creep upward off the x axis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nationally the percentage of 25 to 29 year olds is 6.8%.  That means
you're .8% ahead.  The population is 306,000, so we're talking about
a surplus of about 2500 people.  That's the population of a small
town, and that's just the surplus. So you have a toehold.  Now you
just have to expand it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And though "youth-driven food boom" may sound frivolous, it is
anything but.  Restaurants and cafes are a big part of the personality
of a city.  Imagine walking down a street in Paris. What are you
walking past?  Little restaurants and cafes.  Imagine driving through
some depressing random exurb.  What are you driving past?  Starbucks
and McDonalds and Pizza Hut.   As Gertrude Stein said, there is no
there there. You could be anywhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These independent restaurants and cafes are not just feeding people.
They're making there be a there here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So here is my first concrete recommendation for turning Pittsburgh
into the next Silicon Valley: do everything you can to encourage
this youth-driven food boom.  What could the city do?  Treat the
people starting these little restaurants and cafes as your users,
and go ask them what they want.  I can guess at least one thing
they might want: a fast permit process.  San Francisco has left you
a huge amount of room to beat them in that department.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I know restaurants aren't the prime mover though.  The prime mover,
as the Times article said, is cheap housing.  That's a big advantage.
But that phrase "cheap housing" is a bit misleading.  There are
plenty of places that are cheaper.  What's special about Pittsburgh
is not that it's cheap, but that it's a cheap place you'd actually
want to live.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of that is the buildings themselves. I realized a long time
ago, back when I was a poor twenty-something myself, that the best
deals were places that had once been rich, and then became poor.
If a place has always been rich, it's nice but too expensive.  If
a place has always been poor, it's cheap but grim.  But if a place
was once rich and then got poor, you can find palaces for cheap.
And that's what's bringing people here.  When Pittsburgh was rich,
a hundred years ago, the people who lived here built big solid
buildings.  Not always in the best taste, but definitely solid.  So
here is another piece of advice for becoming a startup hub: don't
destroy the buildings that are bringing people here.  When cities
are on the way back up, like Pittsburgh is now, developers race to
tear down the old buildings.  Don't let that happen.  Focus on
historic preservation.  Big real estate development projects are
not what's bringing the twenty-somethings here.  They're the opposite
of the new restaurants and cafes; they subtract personality from
the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The empirical evidence suggests you cannot be too strict about
historic preservation.  The tougher cities are about it, the better
they seem to do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the appeal of Pittsburgh is not just the buildings themselves.
It's the neighborhoods they're in. Like San Francisco and New York,
Pittsburgh is fortunate in being a pre-car city.  It's not too
spread out. Because those 25 to 29 year olds do not like driving.
They prefer walking, or bicycling, or taking public transport.  If
you've been to San Francisco recently you can't help noticing the
huge number of bicyclists.  And this is not just a fad that the
twenty-somethings have adopted.  In this respect they have discovered
a better way to live.  The beards will go, but not the bikes.  Cities
where you can get around without driving are just better period.
So I would suggest you do everything you can to capitalize on this.
As with historic preservation, it seems impossible to go too far.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why not make Pittsburgh the most bicycle and pedestrian friendly
city in the country?  See if you can go so far that you make San
Francisco seem backward by comparison.  If you do, it's very unlikely
you'll regret it.  The city will seem like a paradise to the young
people you want to attract.  If they do leave to get jobs elsewhere,
it will be with regret at leaving behind such a place.  And what's
the downside?  Can you imagine a headline "City ruined by becoming
too bicycle-friendly?"  It just doesn't happen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So suppose cool old neighborhoods and cool little restaurants make
this the next Portland.  Will that be enough?  It will put you in
a way better position than Portland itself, because Pittsburgh has
something Portland lacks: a first-rate research university.  CMU
plus little cafes means you have more than hipsters drinking lattes.
It means you have hipsters drinking lattes while talking about
distributed systems.  Now you're getting really close to San
Francisco.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In fact you're better off than San Francisco in one way, because
CMU is downtown, but Stanford and Berkeley are out in the suburbs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What can CMU do to help Pittsburgh become a startup hub?  Be an
even better research university.  CMU is one of the best universities
in the world, but imagine what things would be like if it were the
very best, and everyone knew it.  There are a lot of ambitious
people who must go to the best place, wherever it is.  If CMU were it, they would all come here. There would be
kids in Kazakhstan dreaming of one day living in Pittsburgh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Being that kind of talent magnet is the most important contribution
universities can make toward making their city a startup hub.  In
fact it is practically the only contribution they can make.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But wait, shouldn't universities be setting up programs with words
like "innovation" and "entrepreneurship" in their names?  No, they
should not.  These kind of things almost always turn out to be
disappointments.  They're pursuing the wrong targets.  The way to
get innovation is not to aim for innovation but to aim for something
more specific, like better batteries or better 3D printing.  And
the way to learn about entrepreneurship is to do it, which you 
&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/before.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;can't
in school&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I know it may disappoint some administrators to hear that the best
thing a university can do to encourage startups is to be a great
university.  It's like telling people who want to lose weight that
the way to do it is to eat less.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But if you want to know where startups come from, look at the
empirical evidence.  Look at the histories of the most successful
startups, and you'll find they grow organically out of a couple of
founders building something that starts as an interesting side
project.  Universities are great at bringing together founders, but
beyond that the best thing they can do is get out of the way.  For
example, by not claiming ownership of "intellectual property" that
students and faculty develop, and by having liberal rules about
deferred admission and leaves of absence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In fact, one of the most effective things a university could do to
encourage startups is an elaborate form of getting out of the way
invented by Harvard.  Harvard used to have exams for the fall
semester after Christmas.  At the beginning of January they had
something called "Reading Period" when you were supposed to be
studying for exams.  And Microsoft and Facebook have something in
common that few people realize: they were both started during Reading
Period.  It's the perfect situation for producing the sort of side
projects that turn into startups. The students are all on campus,
but they don't have to do anything because they're supposed to be
studying for exams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Harvard may have closed this window, because a few years ago they
moved exams before Christmas and shortened reading period from 11
days to 7.  But if a university really wanted to help its students
start startups, the empirical evidence, weighted by market cap,
suggests the best thing they can do is literally nothing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The culture of Pittsburgh is another of its strengths.  It seems
like a city has to be socially liberal to be a startup hub,
and it's pretty clear why. A city has to tolerate strangeness to
be a home for startups, because startups are so strange.  And you
can't choose to allow just the forms of strangeness that will turn
into big startups, because they're all intermingled.  You have to
tolerate all strangeness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That immediately rules out &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/06/us/gay-rights-mississippi-north-carolina.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;big chunks of the US&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  I'm optimistic
it doesn't rule out Pittsburgh.  One of the things I remember from
growing up here, though I didn't realize at the time that there was
anything unusual about it, is how well people got along.  I'm still
not sure why.  Maybe one reason was that everyone felt like an
immigrant.  When I was a kid in Monroeville, people didn't call
themselves American.  They called themselves Italian or Serbian or
Ukranian.  Just imagine what it must have been like here a hundred
years ago, when people were pouring in from twenty different
countries.  Tolerance was the only option.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What I remember about the culture of Pittsburgh is that it was
both tolerant and pragmatic.  That's how I'd describe the culture
of Silicon Valley too.  And it's not a coincidence, because Pittsburgh
was the Silicon Valley of its time.  This was a city where people
built new things.  And while the things people build have changed,
the spirit you need to do that kind of work is the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So although an influx of latte-swilling hipsters may be annoying
in some ways, I would go out of my way to encourage them.  And more
generally to tolerate strangeness, even unto the degree wacko
Californians do.  For Pittsburgh that is a conservative choice:
it's a return to the city's roots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately I saved the toughest part for last. There is one more
thing you need to be a startup hub, and Pittsburgh hasn't got it:
investors.  Silicon Valley has a big investor community because
it's had 50 years to grow one.  New York has a big investor community
because it's full of people who like money a lot and are quick to
notice new ways to get it.  But Pittsburgh has neither of these.
And the cheap housing that draws other people here has no effect
on investors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If an investor community grows up here, it will happen the same way
it did in Silicon Valley: slowly and organically.  So I would not
bet on having a big investor community in the short term.  But
fortunately there are three trends that make that less necessary
than it used to be.  One is that startups are increasingly cheap
to start, so you just don't need as much outside money as you used
to.  The second is that thanks to things like Kickstarter, a startup
can get to revenue faster.  You can put something on Kickstarter
from anywhere.  The third is programs like Y Combinator.  A startup
from anywhere in the world can go to YC for 3 months, pick up
funding, and then return home if they want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My advice is to make Pittsburgh a great place for startups, and
gradually more of them will stick.  Some of those will succeed;
some of their founders will become investors; and still more startups
will stick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not a fast path to becoming a startup hub. But it is at
least a path, which is something few other cities have.  And it's
not as if you have to make painful sacrifices in the meantime.
Think about what I've suggested you should do.  Encourage local
restaurants, save old buildings, take advantage of density, make
CMU the best, promote tolerance.  These are the things that make
Pittsburgh good to live in now.  All I'm saying is that you should
do even more of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And that's an encouraging thought.  If Pittsburgh's path to becoming
a startup hub is to be even more itself, then it has a good chance
of succeeding.  In fact it probably has the best chance of any city
its size.  It will take some effort, and a lot of time, but if any
city can do it, Pittsburgh can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thanks&lt;/b&gt; to Charlie Cheever and Jessica Livingston for reading
drafts of this, and to Meg Cheever for organizing Opt412 and inviting
me to speak.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Life is Short</title>
      <link>https://paulgraham.com//vb.html</link>
      <description>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;January 2016&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Life is short, as everyone knows. When I was a kid I used to wonder
about this. Is life actually short, or are we really complaining
about its finiteness?  Would we be just as likely to feel life was
short if we lived 10 times as long?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since there didn't seem any way to answer this question, I stopped
wondering about it.  Then I had kids.  That gave me a way to answer
the question, and the answer is that life actually is short.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;br&lt;/font&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;January 2016&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Life is short, as everyone knows. When I was a kid I used to wonder
about this. Is life actually short, or are we really complaining
about its finiteness?  Would we be just as likely to feel life was
short if we lived 10 times as long?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since there didn't seem any way to answer this question, I stopped
wondering about it.  Then I had kids.  That gave me a way to answer
the question, and the answer is that life actually is short.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Having kids showed me how to convert a continuous quantity, time,
into discrete quantities. You only get 52 weekends with your 2 year
old.  If Christmas-as-magic lasts from say ages 3 to 10, you only
get to watch your child experience it 8 times.  And while it's
impossible to say what is a lot or a little of a continuous quantity
like time, 8 is not a lot of something.  If you had a handful of 8
peanuts, or a shelf of 8 books to choose from, the quantity would
definitely seem limited, no matter what your lifespan was.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ok, so life actually is short.  Does it make any difference to know
that?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has for me.  It means arguments of the form "Life is too short
for x" have great force.  It's not just a figure of speech to say
that life is too short for something.  It's not just a synonym for
annoying.  If you find yourself thinking that life is too short for
something, you should try to eliminate it if you can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When I ask myself what I've found life is too short for, the word
that pops into my head is "bullshit." I realize that answer is
somewhat tautological.  It's almost the definition of bullshit that
it's the stuff that life is too short for.  And yet bullshit does
have a distinctive character.  There's something fake about it.
It's the junk food of experience.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/vb.html#f1n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you ask yourself what you spend your time on that's bullshit,
you probably already know the answer.  Unnecessary meetings, pointless
disputes, bureaucracy, posturing, dealing with other people's
mistakes, traffic jams, addictive but unrewarding pastimes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two ways this kind of thing gets into your life: it's
either forced on you, or it tricks you.  To some extent you have to
put up with the bullshit forced on you by circumstances.  You need
to make money, and making money consists mostly of errands.  Indeed,
the law of supply and demand ensures that: the more rewarding some
kind of work is, the cheaper people will do it.  It may be that
less bullshit is forced on you than you think, though.  There has
always been a stream of people who opt out of the default grind and
go live somewhere where opportunities are fewer in the conventional
sense, but life feels more authentic.  This could become more common.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can do it on a smaller scale without moving.  The amount of
time you have to spend on bullshit varies between employers.  Most
large organizations (and many small ones) are steeped in it.  But
if you consciously prioritize bullshit avoidance over other factors
like money and prestige, you can probably find employers that will
waste less of your time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you're a freelancer or a small company, you can do this at the
level of individual customers.  If you fire or avoid toxic customers,
you can decrease the amount of bullshit in your life by more than
you decrease your income.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But while some amount of bullshit is inevitably forced on you, the
bullshit that sneaks into your life by tricking you is no one's
fault but your own.  And yet the bullshit you choose may be harder
to eliminate than the bullshit that's forced on you.  Things that
lure you into wasting your time have to be really good at
tricking you.  An example that will be familiar to a lot of people
is arguing online.  When someone
contradicts you, they're in a sense attacking you. Sometimes pretty
overtly.  Your instinct when attacked is to defend yourself.  But
like a lot of instincts, this one wasn't designed for the world we
now live in.  Counterintuitive as it feels, it's better most of
the time not to defend yourself.  Otherwise these people are literally
taking your life.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/vb.html#f2n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arguing online is only incidentally addictive. There are more
dangerous things than that. As I've written before, one byproduct
of technical progress is that things we like tend to become &lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/addiction.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;more
addictive&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  Which means we will increasingly have to make a conscious
effort to avoid addictions  to stand outside ourselves and ask "is
this how I want to be spending my time?"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As well as avoiding bullshit, one should actively seek out things
that matter.  But different things matter to different people, and
most have to learn what matters to them.  A few are lucky and realize
early on that they love math or taking care of animals or writing,
and then figure out a way to spend a lot of time doing it.  But
most people start out with a life that's a mix of things that
matter and things that don't, and only gradually learn to distinguish
between them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the young especially, much of this confusion is induced by the
artificial situations they find themselves in. In middle school and
high school, what the other kids think of you seems the most important
thing in the world.  But when you ask adults what they got wrong
at that age, nearly all say they cared too much what other kids
thought of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One heuristic for distinguishing stuff that matters is to ask
yourself whether you'll care about it in the future.  Fake stuff
that matters usually has a sharp peak of seeming to matter.  That's
how it tricks you.  The area under the curve is small, but its shape
jabs into your consciousness like a pin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The things that matter aren't necessarily the ones people would
call "important."  Having coffee with a friend matters.  You won't
feel later like that was a waste of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One great thing about having small children is that they make you
spend time on things that matter: them. They grab your sleeve as
you're staring at your phone and say "will you play with me?" And
odds are that is in fact the bullshit-minimizing option.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If life is short, we should expect its shortness to take us by
surprise. And that is just what tends to happen.  You take things
for granted, and then they're gone.  You think you can always write
that book, or climb that mountain, or whatever, and then you realize
the window has closed.  The saddest windows close when other people
die. Their lives are short too.  After my mother died, I wished I'd
spent more time with her.  I lived as if she'd always be there.
And in her typical quiet way she encouraged that illusion.  But an
illusion it was. I think a lot of people make the same mistake I
did.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The usual way to avoid being taken by surprise by something is to
be consciously aware of it.  Back when life was more precarious,
people used to be aware of death to a degree that would now seem a
bit morbid.  I'm not sure why, but it doesn't seem the right answer
to be constantly reminding oneself of the grim reaper hovering at
everyone's shoulder.  Perhaps a better solution is to look at the
problem from the other end. Cultivate a habit of impatience about
the things you most want to do. Don't wait before climbing that
mountain or writing that book or visiting your mother.  You don't
need to be constantly reminding yourself why you shouldn't wait.
Just don't wait.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I can think of two more things one does when one doesn't have much
of something: try to get more of it, and savor what one has.  Both
make sense here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How you live affects how long you live.  Most people could do better.
Me among them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But you can probably get even more effect by paying closer attention
to the time you have.  It's easy to let the days rush by.  The
"flow" that imaginative people love so much has a darker cousin
that prevents you from pausing to savor life amid the daily slurry
of errands and alarms.  One of the most striking things I've read
was not in a book, but the title of one: James Salter's &lt;i&gt;Burning
the Days&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is possible to slow time somewhat. I've gotten better at it.
Kids help.  When you have small children, there are a lot of moments
so perfect that you can't help noticing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It does help too to feel that you've squeezed everything out of
some experience.  The reason I'm sad about my mother is not just
that I miss her but that I think of all the things we could have
done that we didn't.  My oldest son will be 7 soon.  And while I
miss the 3 year old version of him, I at least don't have any regrets
over what might have been.  We had the best time a daddy and a 3
year old ever had.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Relentlessly prune bullshit, don't wait to do things that matter,
and savor the time you have.  That's what you do when life is short.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f1n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
At first I didn't like it that the word that came to mind was
one that had other meanings.  But then I realized the other meanings
are fairly closely related.  Bullshit in the sense of things you
waste your time on is a lot like intellectual bullshit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f2n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
I chose this example deliberately as a note to self.  I get
attacked a lot online.  People tell the craziest lies about me.
And I have so far done a pretty mediocre job of suppressing the
natural human inclination to say "Hey, that's not true!"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thanks&lt;/b&gt; to Jessica Livingston and Geoff Ralston for reading drafts
of this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt; --&gt;
January 2016&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the 1970s, economic inequality in the US has increased
dramatically. And in particular, the rich have gotten a lot richer.
Nearly everyone who writes about the topic says that economic inequality
should be decreased.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I'm interested in this question because I was one of the founders of
a company called Y Combinator that helps people start startups.
Almost by definition, if a startup succeeds, its founders become
rich. Which means by helping startup founders I've been helping to
increase economic inequality.  If economic inequality should be 
decreased, I shouldn't be helping founders. No one should
be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But that doesn't sound right. What's going on here? What's going
on is that while economic inequality is a single measure (or more
precisely, two: variation in income, and variation in wealth), it
has multiple causes. Many of these causes are bad, like tax loopholes
and drug addiction. But some are good, like Larry Page and
Sergey Brin starting the company you use to find things online.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you want to understand economic inequality — and more importantly,
if you actually want to fix the bad aspects of it — you have to
tease apart the components.  And yet the trend in nearly everything
written about the subject is to do the opposite: to squash together
all the aspects of economic inequality as if it were a single
phenomenon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes this is done for ideological reasons.  Sometimes it's
because the writer only has very high-level data and so draws
conclusions from that, like the proverbial drunk who looks for his
keys under the lamppost, instead of where he dropped them, because the
light is better there.  Sometimes it's because the writer doesn't
understand critical aspects of inequality, like the role of technology
in wealth creation.  Much of the time, perhaps most of the time,
writing about economic inequality combines all three.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;center&gt;___&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most common mistake people make about economic inequality is
to treat it as a single phenomenon.  The most naive version of which
is the one based on the pie fallacy: that the rich get rich by
taking money from the poor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Usually this is an assumption people start from rather than a
conclusion they arrive at by examining the evidence.  Sometimes the
pie fallacy is stated explicitly:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  ...those at the top are grabbing an increasing fraction of the
  nation's income — so much of a larger share that what's left over
  for the rest is diminished....
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/ineq.html#f1n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Other times it's more unconscious. But the unconscious form is very
widespread.  I think because we grow up in a world where the pie
fallacy is actually true.  To kids, wealth &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a fixed pie
that's shared out, and if one person gets more, it's at the expense
of another.  It takes a conscious effort to remind oneself that the
real world doesn't work that way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the real world you can create wealth as well as taking it from
others.  A woodworker creates wealth.  He makes a chair, and you
willingly give him money in return for it.  A high-frequency trader
does not.  He makes a dollar only when someone on the other end of
a trade loses a dollar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the rich people in a society got that way by taking wealth from
the poor, then you have the degenerate case of economic inequality,
where the cause of poverty is the same as the cause of wealth.  But
instances of inequality don't have to be instances of the degenerate
case.  If one woodworker makes 5 chairs and another makes none, the
second woodworker will have less money, but not because anyone took
anything from him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even people sophisticated enough to know about the pie fallacy are
led toward it by the custom of describing economic inequality as a
ratio of one quantile's income or wealth to another's.  It's so
easy to slip from talking about income shifting from one quantile
to another, as a figure of speech, into believing that is literally
what's happening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Except in the degenerate case, economic inequality can't be described
by a ratio or even a curve.  In the general case it consists of
multiple ways people become poor, and multiple ways people become
rich.  Which means to understand economic inequality in a country,
you have to go find individual people who are poor or rich and
figure out why.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/ineq.html#f2n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you want to understand &lt;i&gt;change&lt;/i&gt; in economic inequality, you
should ask what those people would have done when it was different.
This is one way I know the rich aren't all getting richer simply
from some new system for transferring wealth to them from
everyone else.  When you use the would-have method with startup
founders, you find what most would have done 
&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/re.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;back in 1960&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, when
economic inequality was lower, was to join big companies or become
professors.  Before Mark Zuckerberg started Facebook, his default
expectation was that he'd end up working at Microsoft.  The reason
he and most other startup founders are richer than they would have
been in the mid 20th century is not because of some right turn the
country took during the Reagan administration, but because progress
in technology has made it much easier to start a new company that
&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/growth.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;grows fast&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditional economists seem strangely averse to studying individual
humans. It seems to be a rule with them that everything has to start
with statistics.  So they give you very precise numbers about
variation in wealth and income, then follow it with the most naive
speculation about the underlying causes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But while there are a lot of people who get rich through rent-seeking
of various forms, and a lot who get rich by playing zero-sum games, 
there are also a significant number
who get rich by creating wealth.  And creating wealth, as a source
of economic inequality, is different from taking it — not just
morally, but also practically, in the sense that it is harder to
eradicate.  One reason is that variation in productivity is
accelerating.  The rate at which individuals can create wealth
depends on the technology available to them, and that grows
exponentially. The other reason creating wealth is such a tenacious
source of inequality is that it can expand to accommodate a lot of
people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;center&gt;___&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I'm all for shutting down the crooked ways to get rich.  But that
won't eliminate great variations in wealth, because as long as you leave
open the option of getting rich by creating wealth, people who want
to get rich will do that instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most people who get rich tend to be fairly driven. Whatever their
other flaws, laziness is usually not one of them.  Suppose new
policies make it hard to make a fortune in finance. Does it seem
plausible that the people who currently go into finance to make
their fortunes will continue to do so, but be content to work for
ordinary salaries? The reason they go into finance is not because
they love finance but because they want to get rich. If the only
way left to get rich is to start startups, they'll start startups.
They'll do well at it too, because determination is the main factor
in the success of a startup. 
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/ineq.html#f3n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;
And while it would probably be
a good thing for the world if people who wanted to get rich switched
from playing zero-sum games to creating wealth, that would not only
not eliminate great variations in wealth, but might even 
exacerbate them.
In a zero-sum game there is at least a limit to the upside.  Plus
a lot of the new startups would create new technology that further
accelerated variation in productivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variation in productivity is far from the only source of economic
inequality, but it is the irreducible core of it, in the sense that
you'll have that left when you eliminate all other sources. And if
you do, that core will be big, because it will have expanded to
include the efforts of all the refugees.  Plus it will have a large
Baumol penumbra around it: anyone who could get rich by creating
wealth on their own account will have to be paid enough to prevent
them from doing it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can't prevent great variations in wealth without preventing people
from getting rich, and you can't do that without preventing them
from starting startups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So let's be clear about that. Eliminating great variations in wealth would
mean eliminating startups.  And that doesn't seem a wise move.
Especially since it would only mean you eliminated
startups in your own country.  Ambitious people already move halfway
around the world to further their careers, and startups can operate
from anywhere nowadays.  So if you made it impossible to get rich
by creating wealth in your country, people who wanted to do that
would just leave and do it somewhere else. Which would
certainly get you a lower Gini coefficient, along with a lesson in
being careful what you ask for. 
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/ineq.html#f4n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;4&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I think rising economic inequality is the inevitable fate of countries
that don't choose something worse. We had a 40 year stretch in the
middle of the 20th century that convinced some people otherwise.
But as I explained in &lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/re.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Refragmentation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
that was an anomaly — a
unique combination of circumstances that compressed American society
not just economically but culturally too.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/ineq.html#f5n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;5&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And while some of the growth in economic inequality we've seen since
then has been due to bad behavior of various kinds, there has
simultaneously been a huge increase in individuals' ability to
create wealth.  Startups are almost entirely a product of this
period. And even within the startup world, there has been a qualitative
change in the last 10 years.  Technology has decreased the cost of
starting a startup so much that founders now have the upper hand
over investors.  Founders get less diluted, and it is now common
for them to retain 
&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/control.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;board control&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as well.  Both further increase
economic inequality, the former because founders own more stock,
and the latter because, as investors have learned, founders tend
to be better at running their companies than investors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the surface manifestations change, the underlying forces are
very, very old.  The acceleration of productivity we see in Silicon
Valley has been happening for thousands of years.  If you look at
the history of stone tools, technology was already accelerating in
the Mesolithic.  The acceleration would have been too slow to
perceive in one lifetime.  Such is the nature of the leftmost part
of an exponential curve.  But it was the same curve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You do not want to design your society in a way that's incompatible
with this curve. The evolution of technology is one of the most
powerful forces in history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Louis Brandeis said "We may have democracy, or we may have wealth
concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have both." That
sounds plausible.  But if I have to choose between ignoring him and
ignoring an exponential curve that has been operating for thousands
of years, I'll bet on the curve.  Ignoring any trend that has been
operating for thousands of years is dangerous.  But exponential
growth, especially, tends to bite you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;center&gt;___&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If accelerating variation in productivity is always going to produce
some baseline growth in economic inequality, it would be a good
idea to spend some time thinking about that future.  Can you have
a healthy society with great variation in wealth?  What would it
look like?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Notice how novel it feels to think about that.  The public conversation
so far has been exclusively about the need to decrease economic
inequality.  We've barely given a thought to how to live with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I'm hopeful we'll be able to.  Brandeis was a product of the Gilded
Age, and things have changed since then. It's harder to hide
wrongdoing now.  And to get rich now you don't have to buy politicians
the way railroad or oil magnates did. 
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/ineq.html#f6n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;6&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;
The great concentrations
of wealth I see around me in Silicon Valley don't seem to be
destroying democracy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are lots of things wrong with the US that have economic
inequality as a symptom. We should fix those things.  In the process
we may decrease economic inequality. But we can't start from the
symptom and hope to fix the underlying causes.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/ineq.html#f7n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;7&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most obvious is poverty. I'm sure most of those who want to
decrease economic inequality want to do it mainly to help the poor,
not to hurt the rich. 
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/ineq.html#f8n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;8&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;
Indeed, a good number are merely being
sloppy by speaking of decreasing economic inequality when what they
mean is decreasing poverty.  But this is a situation where it would
be good to be precise about what we want.  Poverty and economic
inequality are not identical.  When the city is turning off your
&lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/07/what-happens-when-detroit-shuts-off-the-water-of-100000-people/374548/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;water&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
because you can't pay the bill, it doesn't make any difference
what Larry Page's net worth is compared to yours.  He might only
be a few times richer than you, and it would still be just as much
of a problem that your water was getting turned off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Closely related to poverty is lack of social mobility.  I've seen
this myself: you don't have to grow up rich or even upper middle
class to get rich as a startup founder, but few successful founders
grew up desperately poor.  But again, the problem here is not simply
economic inequality.  There is an enormous difference in wealth
between the household Larry Page grew up in and that of a successful
startup founder, but that didn't prevent him from joining their
ranks.  It's not economic inequality per se that's blocking social
mobility, but some specific combination of things that go wrong
when kids grow up sufficiently poor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most important principles in Silicon Valley is that "you
make what you measure."  It means that if you pick some number to
focus on, it will tend to improve, but that you have to choose the
right number, because only the one you choose will improve; another
that seems conceptually adjacent might not.  For example, if you're
a university president and you decide to focus on graduation rates,
then you'll improve graduation rates.  But only graduation rates,
not how much students learn.  Students could learn less, if to
improve graduation rates you made classes easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Economic inequality is sufficiently far from identical with the
various problems that have it as a symptom that we'll probably only
hit whichever of the two we aim at.  If we aim at economic inequality,
we won't fix these problems.  So I say let's aim at the problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example, let's attack poverty, and if necessary damage wealth
in the process. That's much more likely to work than attacking
wealth in the hope that you will thereby fix poverty.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/ineq.html#f9n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;9&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;
And if
there are people getting rich by tricking consumers or lobbying the
government for anti-competitive regulations or tax loopholes, then
let's stop them. Not because it's causing economic inequality, but
because it's stealing.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/ineq.html#f10n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;10&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If all you have is statistics, it seems like that's what you need
to fix. But behind a broad statistical measure like economic
inequality there are some things that are good and some that are
bad, some that are historical trends with immense momentum and
others that are random accidents.  If we want to fix the world
behind the statistics, we have to understand it, and focus our
efforts where they'll do the most good.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f1n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Stiglitz, Joseph. &lt;i&gt;The Price of Inequality&lt;/i&gt;. Norton, 2012. p.
32.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f2n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Particularly since economic inequality is a matter of outliers,
and outliers are disproportionately likely to have gotten where
they are by ways that have little do with the sort of things
economists usually think about, like wages and productivity, but
rather by, say, ending up on the wrong side of the "War on Drugs."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f3n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Determination is the most important factor in deciding between
success and failure, which in startups tend to be sharply differentiated.
But it takes more than determination to create one of the hugely
successful startups.  Though most founders start out excited about
the idea of getting rich, purely mercenary founders will usually
take one of the big acquisition offers most successful startups get
on the way up.  The founders who go on to the next stage tend to
be driven by a sense of mission.  They have the same attachment to
their companies that an artist or writer has to their work.  But
it is very hard to predict at the outset which founders will do
that. It's not simply a function of their initial attitude.  Starting
a company changes people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f4n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;4&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
After reading a draft of this essay, Richard Florida told me
how he had once talked to a group of Europeans "who said
 they wanted to make Europe more entrepreneurial and more
  like Silicon Valley. I said by definition this will give you more
  inequality.  They thought I was insane — they could not process
  it."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f5n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;5&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Economic inequality has been decreasing globally.  But this
is mainly due to the erosion of the kleptocracies that formerly
dominated all the poorer countries.  Once the playing field is
leveler politically, we'll see economic inequality start to rise
again. The US is the bellwether.  The situation we face here, the
rest of the world will sooner or later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f6n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;6&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Some people still get rich by buying politicians.  My point is that
it's no longer a precondition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f7n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;7&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
As well as problems that have economic inequality as a symptom,
there are those that have it as a cause.  But in most if not all,
economic inequality is not the primary cause.  There is usually
some injustice that is allowing economic inequality to turn into
other forms of inequality, and that injustice is what we need to
fix.  For example, the police in the US treat the poor worse than
the rich.  But the solution is not to make people richer. It's to
make the police treat people more equitably.  Otherwise they'll
continue to maltreat people who are weak in other ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f8n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;8&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Some who read this essay will say that I'm clueless or even
being deliberately misleading by focusing so much on the richer end
of economic inequality — that economic inequality is really about
poverty. But that is exactly the point I'm making, though sloppier
language than I'd use to make it.  The real problem is poverty, not
economic inequality.  And if you conflate them you're aiming at the
wrong target.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Others will say I'm clueless or being misleading by focusing on
people who get rich by creating wealth — that startups aren't the
problem, but corrupt practices in finance, healthcare, and so on.
Once again, that is exactly my point.  The problem is not economic
inequality, but those specific abuses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a strange task to write an essay about why something isn't the
problem, but that's the situation you find yourself in when so many
people mistakenly think it is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f9n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;9&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Particularly since many causes of poverty are only partially
driven by people trying to make money from them. For example,
America's abnormally high incarceration rate is a major cause of
poverty.  But although &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/04/28/how-for-profit-prisons-have-become-the-biggest-lobby-no-one-is-talking-about/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;for-profit prison companies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and 
&lt;a href="http://mic.com/articles/41531/union-of-the-snake-how-california-s-prison-guards-subvert-democracy"&gt;&lt;u&gt;prison guard unions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; both spend 
a lot lobbying for harsh sentencing laws, they
are not the original source of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f10n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;10&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Incidentally, tax loopholes are definitely not a product
of some power shift due to recent increases in economic inequality.
The golden age of economic equality in the mid 20th century was
also the golden age of tax avoidance. Indeed, it was so widespread
and so effective that I'm skeptical whether economic inequality was
really so low then as we think.  In a period when people are trying
to hide wealth from the government, it will tend to be hidden from
statistics too. One sign of the potential magnitude of the problem
is the discrepancy between government receipts as a percentage of
GDP, which have remained more or less constant during the entire
period from the end of World War II to the present, and tax rates,
which have varied dramatically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Thanks&lt;/b&gt; to Sam Altman, Tiffani Ashley Bell, Patrick Collison, Ron
Conway, Richard Florida, Ben Horowitz, Jessica Livingston, Robert
Morris, Tim O'Reilly, Max Roser, and Alexia Tsotsis for reading
drafts of this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; This is a new version from which I
removed a pair of metaphors that made a lot of people mad, 
essentially by macroexpanding them.  If anyone wants to see 
the old version, I put it &lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/ineqold.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;here&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>The Refragmentation</title>
      <link>https://paulgraham.com//re.html</link>
      <description>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;January 2016&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One advantage of being old is that you can see change happen in
your lifetime.  A lot of the change I've seen is fragmentation.  US
politics is much more polarized than it used to be.  Culturally we
have ever less common ground. The creative class flocks to a handful
of happy cities, abandoning the rest.  And increasing economic

      <content:encoded>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;January 2016&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One advantage of being old is that you can see change happen in
your lifetime.  A lot of the change I've seen is fragmentation.  US
politics is much more polarized than it used to be.  Culturally we
have ever less common ground. The creative class flocks to a handful
of happy cities, abandoning the rest.  And increasing economic
inequality means the spread between rich and poor is growing too.
I'd like to propose a hypothesis: that all these trends are instances
of the same phenomenon.  And moreover, that the cause is not some
force that's pulling us apart, but rather the erosion of forces
that had been pushing us together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Worse still, for those who worry about these trends, the forces
that were pushing us together were an anomaly, a one-time combination
of circumstances that's unlikely to be repeated — and indeed, that
we would not want to repeat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two forces were war (above all World War II), and the rise of
large corporations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The effects of World War II were both economic and social.
Economically, it decreased variation in income.  Like all modern
armed forces, America's were socialist economically.  From each
according to his ability, to each according to his need.  More or
less.  Higher ranking members of the military got more (as higher
ranking members of socialist societies always do), but what they
got was fixed according to their rank.  And the flattening effect
wasn't limited to those under arms, because the US economy was
conscripted too.  Between 1942 and 1945 all wages were set by the
National War Labor Board. Like the military, they defaulted to
flatness.  And this national standardization of wages was so pervasive
that its effects could still be seen years after the war ended.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f1n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Business owners weren't supposed to be making money either.  FDR
said "not a single war millionaire" would be permitted.  To ensure
that, any increase in a company's profits over prewar levels was
taxed at 85%.  And when what was left after corporate taxes reached
individuals, it was taxed again at a marginal rate of 93%.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f2n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Socially too the war tended to decrease variation.  Over 16 million
men and women from all sorts of different backgrounds were brought
together in a way of life that was literally uniform.  Service rates
for men born in the early 1920s approached 80%. And working toward
a common goal, often under stress, brought them still closer together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though strictly speaking World War II lasted less than 4 years for
the US, its effects lasted longer.  Wars make central governments
more powerful, and World War II was an extreme case of this.  In
the US, as in all the other Allied countries, the federal government
was slow to give up the new powers it had acquired.  Indeed, in
some respects the war didn't end in 1945; the enemy just switched
to the Soviet Union.  In tax rates, federal power, defense spending,
conscription, and nationalism, the decades after the war looked more
like wartime than prewar peacetime.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f3n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;
And the social effects
lasted too.  The kid pulled into the army from behind a mule team
in West Virginia didn't simply go back to the farm afterward.
Something else was waiting for him, something that looked a lot
like the army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If total war was the big political story of the 20th century, the
big economic story was the rise of a new kind of company.  And this
too tended to produce both social and economic cohesion.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f4n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;4&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 20th century was the century of the big, national corporation.
General Electric, General Foods, General Motors.  Developments in
finance, communications, transportation, and manufacturing enabled
a new type of company whose goal was above all scale.  Version 1
of this world was low-res: a Duplo world of a few giant companies
dominating each big market.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f5n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;5&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The late 19th and early 20th centuries had been a time of consolidation,
led especially by J. P. Morgan.  Thousands of companies run by their
founders were merged into a couple hundred giant ones run by
professional managers. Economies of scale ruled the day.  It seemed
to people at the time that this was the final state of things.  John
D. Rockefeller said in 1880
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  The day of combination is here to stay. Individualism has gone,
  never to return.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He turned out to be mistaken, but he seemed right for the next
hundred years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The consolidation that began in the late 19th century continued for
most of the 20th.  By the end of World War II, as Michael Lind
writes, "the major sectors of the economy were either organized
as government-backed cartels or dominated by a few oligopolistic
corporations."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For consumers this new world meant the same choices everywhere, but
only a few of them.  When I grew up there were only 2 or 3 of most
things, and since they were all aiming at the middle of the market
there wasn't much to differentiate them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most important instances of this phenomenon was in TV.
Here there were 3 choices: NBC, CBS, and ABC. Plus public TV for
eggheads and communists.  The programs that the 3 networks offered were
indistinguishable.  In fact, here there was a triple pressure toward
the center. If one show did try something daring, local affiliates
in conservative markets would make them stop. Plus since TVs were
expensive, whole families watched the same shows together, so they
had to be suitable for everyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And not only did everyone get the same thing, they got it at the
same time.  It's difficult to imagine now, but every night tens of
millions of families would sit down together in front of their TV
set watching the same show, at the same time, as their next door
neighbors.  What happens now with the Super Bowl used to happen
every night. We were literally in sync.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f6n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;6&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a way mid-century TV culture was good. The view it gave of the
world was like you'd find in a children's book, and it probably had
something of the effect that (parents hope) children's books have
in making people behave better.  But, like children's books, TV was
also misleading.  Dangerously misleading, for adults. In his
autobiography, Robert MacNeil talks of seeing gruesome images that
had just come in from Vietnam and thinking, we can't show these to
families while they're having dinner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I know how pervasive the common culture was, because I tried to opt
out of it, and it was practically impossible to find alternatives.
When I was 13 I realized, more from internal evidence than any
outside source, that the ideas we were being fed on TV were crap,
and I stopped watching it.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f7n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;7&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;
But it wasn't just TV.  It seemed
like everything around me was crap.  The politicians all saying the
same things, the consumer brands making almost identical products
with different labels stuck on to indicate how prestigious they
were meant to be, the balloon-frame houses with fake "colonial"
skins, the cars with several feet of gratuitous metal on each end
that started to fall apart after a couple years, the "red delicious"
apples that were red but only nominally 
apples. And in retrospect, it &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; crap.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f8n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;8&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But when I went looking for alternatives to fill this void, I found
practically nothing.  There was no Internet then.  The only place
to look was in the chain bookstore in our local shopping mall. 
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f9n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;9&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;
There I found a copy of &lt;i&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/i&gt;.  I wish I could say it became
a gateway into a wider world, but in fact I found it boring and
incomprehensible.  Like a kid tasting whisky for the first time and
pretending to like it, I preserved that magazine as carefully as
if it had been a book. I'm sure I still have it somewhere.  But
though it was evidence that there was, somewhere, a world that
wasn't red delicious, I didn't find it till college.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It wasn't just as consumers that the big companies made us similar.
They did as employers too.  Within companies there were powerful
forces pushing people toward a single model of how to look and act.
IBM was particularly notorious for this, but they were only a little
more extreme than other big companies.  And the models of how to
look and act varied little between companies. Meaning everyone
within this world was expected to seem more or less the same.  And
not just those in the corporate world, but also everyone who aspired
to it — which in the middle of the 20th century meant most people
who weren't already in it.  For most of the 20th century, working-class
people tried hard to look middle class.  You can see it in old
photos.  Few adults aspired to look dangerous in 1950.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the rise of national corporations didn't just compress us
culturally.  It compressed us economically too, and on both ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along with giant national corporations, we got giant national labor
unions.  And in the mid 20th century the corporations cut deals
with the unions where they paid over market price for labor.  Partly
because the unions were monopolies. 
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f10n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;10&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;
Partly because, as
components of oligopolies themselves, the corporations knew they
could safely pass the cost on to their customers, because their
competitors would have to as well.  And partly because in mid-century
most of the giant companies were still focused on finding new ways
to milk economies of scale.  Just as startups rightly pay AWS a
premium over the cost of running their own servers so they can focus
on growth, many of the big national corporations were willing to
pay a premium for labor. 
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f11n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;11&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As well as pushing incomes up from the bottom, by overpaying unions,
the big companies of the 20th century also pushed incomes down at
the top, by underpaying their top management. Economist J. K.
Galbraith wrote in 1967 that "There are few corporations in which
it would be suggested that executive salaries are at a maximum."
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f12n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;12&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To some extent this was an illusion.  Much of the de facto pay of
executives never showed up on their income tax returns, because it
took the form of perks.  The higher the rate of income tax, the
more pressure there was to pay employees upstream of it.  (In the
UK, where taxes were even higher than in the US, companies would
even pay their kids' private school tuitions.)  One of the most
valuable things the big companies of the mid 20th century gave their
employees was job security, and this too didn't show up in tax
returns or income statistics. So the nature of employment in these
organizations tended to yield falsely low numbers about economic
inequality.  But even accounting for that, the big companies paid
their best people less than market price.  There was no market; the
expectation was that you'd work for the same company for decades
if not your whole career. 
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f13n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;13&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your work was so illiquid there was little chance of getting market
price. But that same illiquidity also encouraged you not to seek
it.  If the company promised to employ you till you retired and
give you a pension afterward, you didn't want to extract as much
from it this year as you could. You needed to take care of the
company so it could take care of you.  Especially when you'd been
working with the same group of people for decades.  If you tried
to squeeze the company for more money, you were squeezing the
organization that was going to take care of &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt;.  Plus if
you didn't put the company first you wouldn't be promoted, and if
you couldn't switch ladders, promotion on this one was the only way
up. 
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f14n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;14&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To someone who'd spent several formative years in the armed forces,
this situation didn't seem as strange as it does to us now.  From
their point of view, as big company executives, they were high-ranking
officers.  They got paid a lot more than privates.  They got to
have expense account lunches at the best restaurants and fly around
on the company's Gulfstreams.  It probably didn't occur to most of
them to ask if they were being paid market price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate way to get market price is to work for yourself, by
starting your own company.  That seems obvious to any ambitious
person now.  But in the mid 20th century it was an alien concept.
Not because starting one's own company seemed too ambitious, but
because it didn't seem ambitious enough. Even as late as the 1970s,
when I grew up, the ambitious plan was to get lots of education at
prestigious institutions, and then join some other prestigious
institution and work one's way up the hierarchy.  Your prestige was
the prestige of the institution you belonged to.  People did start
their own businesses of course, but educated people rarely did,
because in those days there was practically zero concept of starting
what we now call a &lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/growth.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;startup&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: 
a business that starts small and grows
big.  That was much harder to do in the mid 20th century.  Starting
one's own business meant starting a business that would start small
and stay small. Which in those days of big companies often meant
scurrying around trying to avoid being trampled by elephants.  It
was more prestigious to be one of the executive class riding the
elephant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By the 1970s, no one stopped to wonder where the big prestigious
companies had come from in the first place.  It seemed like they'd
always been there, like the chemical elements.  And indeed, there
was a double wall between ambitious kids in the 20th century and
the origins of the big companies.  Many of the big companies were
roll-ups that didn't have clear founders.  And when they did, the
founders didn't seem like us.  Nearly all of them had been uneducated,
in the sense of not having been to college.  They were what Shakespeare
called rude mechanicals.  College trained one to be a member of the
professional classes.  Its graduates didn't expect to do the sort
of grubby menial work that Andrew Carnegie or Henry Ford started
out doing. 
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f15n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;15&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And in the 20th century there were more and more college graduates.
They increased from about 2% of the population in 1900 to about 25%
in 2000. In the middle of the century our two big forces intersect,
in the form of the GI Bill, which sent 2.2 million World War II
veterans to college.  Few thought of it in these terms, but the
result of making college the canonical path for the ambitious was
a world in which it was socially acceptable to work for Henry Ford,
but not to be Henry Ford.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f16n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;16&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I remember this world well. I came of age just as it was starting
to break up. In my childhood it was still dominant. Not quite so
dominant as it had been.  We could see from old TV shows and yearbooks
and the way adults acted that people in the 1950s and 60s had been
even more conformist than us.  The mid-century model was already
starting to get old. But that was not how we saw it at the time.
We would at most have said that one could be a bit more daring in
1975 than 1965.  And indeed, things hadn't changed much yet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But change was coming soon. And when the Duplo economy started to
disintegrate, it disintegrated in several different ways at once.
Vertically integrated companies literally dis-integrated because
it was more efficient to.  Incumbents faced new competitors as (a)
markets went global and (b) technical innovation started to trump
economies of scale, turning size from an asset into a liability.
Smaller companies were increasingly able to survive as formerly
narrow channels to consumers broadened.  Markets themselves started
to change faster, as whole new categories of products appeared. And
last but not least, the federal government, which had previously
smiled upon J. P. Morgan's world as the natural state of things,
began to realize it wasn't the last word after all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What J. P. Morgan was to the horizontal axis, Henry Ford was to the
vertical.  He wanted to do everything himself. The giant plant he
built at River Rouge between 1917 and 1928 literally took in iron
ore at one end and sent cars out the other.  100,000 people worked
there. At the time it seemed the future. But that is not how car
companies operate today.  Now much of the design and manufacturing
happens in a long supply chain, whose products the car companies
ultimately assemble and sell.  The reason car companies operate
this way is that it works better.  Each company in the supply chain
focuses on what they know best. And they each have to do it well
or they can be swapped out for another supplier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why didn't Henry Ford realize that networks of cooperating companies
work better than a single big company? One reason is that supplier
networks take a while to evolve. In 1917, doing everything himself
seemed to Ford the only way to get the scale he needed. And the
second reason is that if you want to solve a problem using a network
of cooperating companies, you have to be able to coordinate their
efforts, and you can do that much better with computers.  Computers
reduce the transaction costs that Coase argued are the raison d'etre
of corporations. That is a fundamental change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the early 20th century, big companies were synonymous with
efficiency.  In the late 20th century they were synonymous with
inefficiency.  To some extent this was because the companies
themselves had become sclerotic.  But it was also because our
standards were higher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It wasn't just within existing industries that change occurred.
The industries themselves changed.  It became possible to make lots
of new things, and sometimes the existing companies weren't the
ones who did it best.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Microcomputers are a classic example. The market was pioneered by
upstarts like Apple. When it got big enough, IBM decided it was
worth paying attention to.  At the time IBM completely dominated
the computer industry. They assumed that all they had to do, now
that this market was ripe, was to reach out and pick it.  Most
people at the time would have agreed with them.  But what happened
next illustrated how much more complicated the world had become.
IBM did launch a microcomputer.  Though quite successful, it did
not crush Apple.  But even more importantly, IBM itself ended up
being supplanted by a supplier coming in from the side — from
software, which didn't even seem to be the same business.  IBM's
big mistake was to accept a non-exclusive license for DOS.  It must
have seemed a safe move at the time.  No other computer manufacturer
had ever been able to outsell them. What difference did it make if
other manufacturers could offer DOS too?  The result of that
miscalculation was an explosion of inexpensive PC clones.  Microsoft
now owned the PC standard, and the customer.  And the microcomputer
business ended up being Apple vs Microsoft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basically, Apple bumped IBM and then Microsoft stole its wallet.
That sort of thing did not happen to big companies in mid-century.
But it was going to happen increasingly often in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Change happened mostly by itself in the computer business.  In other
industries, legal obstacles had to be removed first.  Many of the
mid-century oligopolies had been anointed by the federal government
with policies (and in wartime, large orders) that kept out competitors.
This didn't seem as dubious to government officials at the time as
it sounds to us. They felt a two-party system ensured sufficient
competition in politics.  It ought to work for business too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gradually the government realized that anti-competitive policies
were doing more harm than good, and during the Carter administration
it started to remove them. The word used for this process was
misleadingly narrow: deregulation.  What was really happening was
de-oligopolization.  It happened to one industry after another.
Two of the most visible to consumers were air travel and long-distance
phone service, which both became dramatically cheaper after
deregulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deregulation also contributed to the wave of hostile takeovers in
the 1980s.  In the old days the only limit on the inefficiency of
companies, short of actual bankruptcy, was the inefficiency of their
competitors.  Now companies had to face absolute rather than relative
standards.  Any public company that didn't generate sufficient
returns on its assets risked having its management replaced with
one that would.  Often the new managers did this by breaking companies
up into components that were more valuable separately.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f17n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;17&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Version 1 of the national economy consisted of a few big blocks
whose relationships were negotiated in back rooms by a handful of
executives, politicians, regulators, and labor leaders.  Version 2
was higher resolution: there were more companies, of more different
sizes, making more different things, and their relationships changed
faster. In this world there were still plenty of back room negotiations,
but more was left to market forces.  Which further accelerated the
fragmentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a little misleading to talk of versions when describing a
gradual process, but not as misleading as it might seem.  There was
a lot of change in a few decades, and what we ended up with was
qualitatively different.  The companies in the S&amp;amp;P 500 in 1958 had
been there an average of 61 years. By 2012 that number was 18 years.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f18n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;18&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The breakup of the Duplo economy happened simultaneously with the
spread of computing power. To what extent were computers a precondition?
It would take a book to answer that. Obviously the spread of computing
power was a precondition for the rise of startups.  I suspect it
was for most of what happened in finance too.  But was it a
precondition for globalization or the LBO wave?  I don't know, but
I wouldn't discount the possibility.  It may be that the refragmentation
was driven by computers in the way the industrial revolution was
driven by steam engines.  Whether or not computers were a precondition,
they have certainly accelerated it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new fluidity of companies changed people's relationships with
their employers. Why climb a corporate ladder that might be yanked
out from under you?  Ambitious people started to think of a career
less as climbing a single ladder than as a series of jobs that might
be at different companies. More movement (or even potential movement)
between companies introduced more competition in salaries.  Plus
as companies became smaller it became easier to estimate how much
an employee contributed to the company's revenue.  Both changes
drove salaries toward market price. And since people vary dramatically
in productivity, paying market price meant salaries started to
diverge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By no coincidence it was in the early 1980s that the term "yuppie"
was coined.  That word is not much used now, because the phenomenon
it describes is so taken for granted, but at the time it was a label
for something novel. Yuppies were young professionals who made lots
of money.  To someone in their twenties today, this wouldn't seem
worth naming.  Why wouldn't young professionals make lots of money?
But until the 1980s, being underpaid early in your career was part
of what it meant to be a professional.  Young professionals were
paying their dues, working their way up the ladder.  The rewards
would come later.  What was novel about yuppies was that they wanted
market price for the work they were doing now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first yuppies did not work for startups. That was still in the
future.  Nor did they work for big companies. They were professionals
working in fields like law, finance, and consulting.  But their example 
rapidly inspired their peers.  Once they saw that new BMW 325i, they 
wanted one too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Underpaying people at the beginning of their career only works if
everyone does it. Once some employer breaks ranks, everyone else
has to, or they can't get good people.  And once started this process
spreads through the whole economy, because at the beginnings of
people's careers they can easily switch not merely employers but
industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But not all young professionals benefitted. You had to produce to
get paid a lot.  It was no coincidence that the first yuppies worked
in fields where it was easy to measure that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More generally, an idea was returning whose name sounds old-fashioned
precisely because it was so rare for so long: that you could make
your fortune.  As in the past there were multiple ways to do it.
Some made their fortunes by creating wealth, and others by playing
zero-sum games. But once it became possible to make one's fortune,
the ambitious had to decide whether or not to.  A physicist who
chose physics over Wall Street in 1990 was making a sacrifice that
a physicist in 1960 didn't have to think about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea even flowed back into big companies.  CEOs of big companies
make more now than they used to, and I think much of the reason is
prestige.  In 1960, corporate CEOs had immense prestige.  They were
the winners of the only economic game in town. But if they made as
little now as they did then, in real dollar terms, they'd seem like
small fry compared to professional athletes and whiz kids making
millions from startups and hedge funds. They don't like that idea,
so now they try to get as much as they can, which is more than they
had been getting. 
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f19n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;19&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile a similar fragmentation was happening at the other end
of the economic scale.  As big companies' oligopolies became less
secure, they were less able to pass costs on to customers and thus
less willing to overpay for labor.  And as the Duplo world of a few
big blocks fragmented into many companies of different sizes — some
of them overseas — it became harder for unions to enforce their
monopolies.  As a result workers' wages also tended toward market
price. Which (inevitably, if unions had been doing their job) tended
to be lower.  Perhaps dramatically so, if automation had decreased
the need for some kind of work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And just as the mid-century model induced social as well as economic
cohesion, its breakup brought social as well as economic fragmentation.
People started to dress and act differently.  Those who would later
be called the "creative class" became more mobile. People who didn't
care much for religion felt less pressure to go to church for
appearances' sake, while those who liked it a lot opted for
increasingly colorful forms. Some switched from meat loaf to tofu,
and others to Hot Pockets. Some switched from driving Ford sedans
to driving small imported cars, and others to driving SUVs.  Kids
who went to private schools or wished they did started to dress
"preppy," and kids who wanted to seem rebellious made a conscious
effort to look disreputable.  In a hundred ways people spread apart.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f20n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;20&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Almost four decades later, fragmentation is still increasing.  Has
it been net good or bad?  I don't know; the question may be
unanswerable.  Not entirely bad though.  We take for granted the
forms of fragmentation we like, and worry only about the ones we
don't. But as someone who caught the tail end of mid-century
&lt;a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=well-adjusted&amp;amp;year_start=1800&amp;amp;year_end=2000&amp;amp;corpus=15&amp;amp;smoothing=3"&gt;&lt;u&gt;conformism&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 
I can tell you it was no utopia.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f21n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;21&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My goal here is not to say whether fragmentation has been good or
bad, just to explain why it's happening.  With the centripetal
forces of total war and 20th century oligopoly mostly gone, what
will happen next?  And more specifically, is it possible to reverse
some of the fragmentation we've seen?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If it is, it will have to happen piecemeal.  You can't reproduce
mid-century cohesion the way it was originally produced.  It would
be insane to go to war just to induce more national unity.  And
once you understand the degree to which the economic history of the
20th century was a low-res version 1, it's clear you can't reproduce
that either.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;20th century cohesion was something that happened at least in a
sense naturally.  The war was due mostly to external forces, and
the Duplo economy was an evolutionary phase.  If you want cohesion
now, you'd have to induce it deliberately.  And it's not obvious
how.  I suspect the best we'll be able to do is address the symptoms
of fragmentation.  But that may be enough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The form of fragmentation people worry most about lately is &lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/ineq.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;economic inequality&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and if you want to eliminate
that you're up against a truly formidable headwind that has
been in operation since the stone age. Technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technology is
a lever. It magnifies work.  And the lever not only grows increasingly
long, but the rate at which it grows is itself increasing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Which in turn means the variation in the amount of wealth people
can create has not only been increasing, but accelerating.  The
unusual conditions that prevailed in the mid 20th century masked
this underlying trend.  The ambitious had little choice but to join
large organizations that made them march in step with lots of other
people — literally in the case of the armed forces, figuratively
in the case of big corporations. Even if the big corporations had
wanted to pay people proportionate to their value, they couldn't
have figured out how.  But that constraint has gone now.  Ever since
it started to erode in the 1970s, we've seen the underlying forces
at work again.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f22n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;22&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not everyone who gets rich now does it by creating wealth, certainly.
But a significant number do, and the Baumol Effect means all their
peers get dragged along too.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f23n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;23&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;
And as long as it's possible to
get rich by creating wealth, the default tendency will be for
economic inequality to increase.  Even if you eliminate all the
other ways to get rich.  You can mitigate this with subsidies at
the bottom and taxes at the top, but unless taxes are high enough
to discourage people from creating wealth, you're always going to
be fighting a losing battle against increasing variation in
productivity.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/re.html#f24n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;24&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That form of fragmentation, like the others, is here to stay.  Or
rather, back to stay.  Nothing is forever, but the tendency toward
fragmentation should be more forever than most things, precisely
because it's not due to any particular cause.  It's simply a reversion
to the mean. When Rockefeller said individualism was gone, he was
right for a hundred years.  It's back now, and that's likely to be
true for longer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I worry that if we don't acknowledge this, we're headed for trouble.
If we think 20th century cohesion disappeared because of few policy
tweaks, we'll be deluded into thinking we can get it back (minus
the bad parts, somehow) with a few countertweaks.  And then we'll
waste our time trying to eliminate fragmentation, when we'd be
better off thinking about how to mitigate its consequences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f1n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Lester Thurow, writing in 1975, said the wage differentials
prevailing at the end of World War II had become so embedded that
they "were regarded as 'just' even after the egalitarian pressures
of World War II had disappeared.  Basically, the same differentials
exist to this day, thirty years later." But Goldin and Margo think
market forces in the postwar period also helped preserve the wartime
compression of wages — specifically increased demand for unskilled
workers, and oversupply of educated ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Oddly enough, the American custom of having employers pay for
health insurance derives from efforts by businesses to circumvent
NWLB wage controls in order to attract workers.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f2n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
As always, tax rates don't tell the whole story.  There were
lots of exemptions, especially for individuals.  And in World War
II the tax codes were so new that the government had little acquired
immunity to tax avoidance.  If the rich paid high taxes during the
war it was more because they wanted to than because they had to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the war, federal tax receipts as a percentage of GDP were
about the same as they are now. In fact, for the entire period since
the war, tax receipts have stayed close to 18% of GDP, despite
dramatic changes in tax rates.  The lowest point occurred when
marginal income tax rates were highest: 14.1% in 1950.  Looking at
the data, it's hard to avoid the conclusion that tax rates have had
little effect on what people actually paid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f3n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Though in fact the decade preceding the war had been a time
of unprecedented federal power, in response to the Depression.
Which is not entirely a coincidence, because the Depression was one
of the causes of the war.  In many ways the New Deal was a sort of
dress rehearsal for the measures the federal government took during
wartime.  The wartime versions were much more drastic and more
pervasive though.  As Anthony Badger wrote, "for many Americans the
decisive change in their experiences came not with the New Deal but
with World War II."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f4n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;4&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
I don't know enough about the origins of the world wars to
say, but it's not inconceivable they were connected to the rise of
big corporations. If that were the case, 20th century cohesion would
have a single cause.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f5n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;5&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
More precisely, there was a bimodal economy consisting, in
Galbraith's words, of "the world of the technically dynamic, massively
capitalized and highly organized corporations on the one hand and
the hundreds of thousands of small and traditional proprietors on
the other." Money, prestige, and power were concentrated in the
former, and there was near zero crossover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f6n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;6&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
I wonder how much of the decline in families eating together
was due to the decline in families watching TV together afterward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f7n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;7&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
I know when this happened because it was the season Dallas
premiered.  Everyone else was talking about what was happening on
Dallas, and I had no idea what they meant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f8n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;8&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
I didn't realize it till I started doing research for this
essay, but the meretriciousness of the products I grew up with is
a well-known byproduct of oligopoly. When companies can't compete
on price, they compete on tailfins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f9n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;9&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Monroeville Mall was at the time of its completion in 1969
the largest in the country. In the late 1970s the movie &lt;i&gt;Dawn of
the Dead&lt;/i&gt; was shot there. Apparently the mall was not just the
location of the movie, but its inspiration; the crowds of shoppers
drifting through this huge mall reminded George Romero of zombies.
My first job was scooping ice cream in the Baskin-Robbins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f10n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;10&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Labor unions were exempted from antitrust laws by the Clayton
Antitrust Act in 1914 on the grounds that a person's work is not
"a commodity or article of commerce." I wonder if that means service
companies are also exempt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f11n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;11&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
The relationships between unions and unionized companies can
even be symbiotic, because unions will exert political pressure to
protect their hosts.  According to Michael Lind, when politicians
tried to attack the A&amp;amp;P supermarket chain because it was putting
local grocery stores out of business, "A&amp;amp;P successfully defended
itself by allowing the unionization of its workforce in 1938, thereby
gaining organized labor as a constituency." I've seen this phenomenon
myself: hotel unions are responsible for more of the political
pressure against Airbnb than hotel companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f12n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;12&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Galbraith was clearly puzzled that corporate executives would
work so hard to make money for other people (the shareholders)
instead of themselves.  He devoted much of &lt;i&gt;The New Industrial
State&lt;/i&gt; to trying to figure this out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;His theory was that professionalism had replaced money as a motive,
and that modern corporate executives were, like (good) scientists,
motivated less by financial rewards than by the desire to do good
work and thereby earn the respect of their peers.  There is something
in this, though I think lack of movement between companies combined
with self-interest explains much of observed behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f13n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;13&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Galbraith (p. 94) says a 1952 study of the 800 highest paid
executives at 300 big corporations found that three quarters of
them had been with their company for more than 20 years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f14n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;14&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
It seems likely that in the first third of the 20th century
executive salaries were low partly because companies then were more
dependent on banks, who would have disapproved if executives got
too much.  This was certainly true in the beginning. The first big
company CEOs were J. P. Morgan's hired hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Companies didn't start to finance themselves with retained earnings
till the 1920s.  Till then they had to pay out their earnings in
dividends, and so depended on banks for capital for expansion.
Bankers continued to sit on corporate boards till the Glass-Steagall
act in 1933.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By mid-century big companies funded 3/4 of their growth from earnings.
But the early years of bank dependence, reinforced by the financial
controls of World War II, must have had a big effect on social
conventions about executive salaries.  So it may be that the lack
of movement between companies was as much the effect of low salaries
as the cause.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Incidentally, the switch in the 1920s to financing growth with
retained earnings was one cause of the 1929 crash.  The banks now
had to find someone else to lend to, so they made more margin loans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f15n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;15&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Even now it's hard to get them to. One of the things I find
hardest to get into the heads of would-be startup founders is how
important it is to do certain kinds of menial work early in the
life of a company.  Doing &lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/ds.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;things that don't
scale&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is to how Henry Ford got started as a high-fiber diet is
to the traditional peasant's diet: they had no choice but to do the
right thing, while we have to make a conscious effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f16n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;16&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Founders weren't celebrated in the press when I was a kid.
"Our founder" meant a photograph of a severe-looking man with a
walrus mustache and a wing collar who had died decades ago. The
thing to be when I was a kid was an &lt;i&gt;executive&lt;/i&gt;. If you weren't
around then it's hard to grasp the cachet that term had. The fancy
version of everything was called the "executive" model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f17n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;17&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
The wave of hostile takeovers in the 1980s was enabled by a
combination of circumstances: court decisions striking down state
anti-takeover laws, starting with the Supreme Court's 1982 decision
in Edgar v. MITE Corp.; the Reagan administration's comparatively
sympathetic attitude toward takeovers; the Depository Institutions
Act of 1982, which allowed banks and savings and loans to buy
corporate bonds; a new SEC rule issued in 1982 (rule 415) that made
it possible to bring corporate bonds to market faster; the creation
of the junk bond business by Michael Milken; a vogue for conglomerates
in the preceding period that caused many companies to be combined
that never should have been; a decade of inflation that left many
public companies trading below the value of their assets; and not
least, the increasing complacency of managements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f18n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;18&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Foster, Richard. "Creative Destruction Whips through Corporate
America." Innosight, February 2012.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f19n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;19&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
CEOs of big companies may be overpaid. I don't know enough
about big companies to say. But it is certainly not impossible for
a CEO to make 200x as much difference to a company's revenues as
the average employee.  Look at what Steve Jobs did for Apple when
he came back as CEO.  It would have been a good deal for the board
to give him 95% of the company.  Apple's market cap the day Steve
came back in July 1997 was 1.73 billion. 5% of Apple now (January
2016) would be worth about 30 billion.  And it would not be if Steve
hadn't come back; Apple probably wouldn't even exist anymore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Merely including Steve in the sample might be enough to answer the
question of whether public company CEOs in the aggregate are overpaid.
And that is not as facile a trick as it might seem, because the
broader your holdings, the more the aggregate is what you care
about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f20n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;20&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
The late 1960s were famous for social upheaval. But that was
more rebellion (which can happen in any era if people are provoked
sufficiently) than fragmentation.  You're not seeing fragmentation
unless you see people breaking off to both left and right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f21n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;21&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Globally the trend has been in the other direction.  While
the US is becoming more fragmented, the world as a whole is becoming
less fragmented, and mostly in good ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f22n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;22&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
There were a handful of ways to make a fortune in the mid
20th century.  The main one was drilling for oil, which was open
to newcomers because it was not something big companies could
dominate through economies of scale.  How did individuals accumulate
large fortunes in an era of such high taxes?  Giant tax loopholes
defended by two of the most powerful men in Congress, Sam Rayburn
and Lyndon Johnson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But becoming a Texas oilman was not in 1950 something one could
aspire to the way starting a startup or going to work on Wall Street
were in 2000, because (a) there was a strong local component and
(b) success depended so much on luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f23n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;23&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
The Baumol Effect induced by startups is very visible in
Silicon Valley.  Google will pay people millions of dollars a year
to keep them from leaving to start or join startups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f24n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;24&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
I'm not claiming variation in productivity is the only cause
of economic inequality in the US. But it's a significant cause, and
it will become as big a cause as it needs to, in the sense that if
you ban other ways to get rich, people who want to get rich will
use this route instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thanks&lt;/b&gt; to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Paul Buchheit, Patrick

      <content:encoded>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;November 2015&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few months ago an article about Y Combinator said that early on
it had been a "one-man show."  It's sadly common to read that sort
of thing.  But the problem with that description is not just that
it's unfair.  It's also misleading.  Much of what's most novel about
YC is due to Jessica Livingston.  If you don't understand her, you
don't understand YC.  So let me tell you a little about Jessica.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;YC had 4 founders.  Jessica and I decided one night to start it,
and the next day we recruited my friends Robert Morris and Trevor
Blackwell.  Jessica and I ran YC day to day, and Robert and Trevor
read applications and did interviews with us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jessica and I were already dating when we started YC.  At first we
tried to act "professional" about this, meaning we tried to conceal
it.  In retrospect that seems ridiculous, and we soon dropped the
pretense.  And the fact that Jessica and I were a couple is a big
part of what made YC what it was.  YC felt like a family.  The
founders early on were mostly young.  We all had dinner together
once a week, cooked for the first couple years by me. Our first
building had been a private home.  The overall atmosphere was
shockingly different from a VC's office on Sand Hill Road, in a way
that was entirely for the better.  There was an authenticity that
everyone who walked in could sense.  And that didn't just mean that
people trusted us.  It was the perfect quality to instill in startups.
Authenticity is one of the most important things YC looks for in
founders, not just because fakers and opportunists are annoying,
but because authenticity is one of the main things that separates
the most successful startups from the rest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Early YC was a family, and Jessica was its mom.  And the culture
she defined was one of YC's most important innovations.  Culture
is important in any organization, but at YC culture wasn't just how
we behaved when we built the product. At YC, the culture was the
product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jessica was also the mom in another sense: she had the last word.
Everything we did as an organization went through her 
to fund, what to say to the public, how to deal with other companies,
who to hire, everything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before we had kids, YC was more or less our life. There was no real
distinction between working hours and not.  We talked about YC all
the time.  And while there might be some businesses that it would
be tedious to let infect your private life, we liked it. We'd started
YC because it was something we were interested in.  And some of the
problems we were trying to solve were endlessly difficult.  How do
you recognize good founders?  You could talk about that for years,
and we did; we still do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I'm better at some things than Jessica, and she's better at some
things than me.  One of the things she's best at is judging people.
She's one of those rare individuals with x-ray vision for character.
She can see through any kind of faker almost immediately.  Her
nickname within YC was the Social Radar, and this special power of
hers was critical in making YC what it is.  The earlier you pick
startups, the more you're picking the founders.  Later stage investors
get to try products and look at growth numbers.  At the stage where
YC invests, there is often neither a product nor any numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Others thought YC had some special insight about the future of
technology.  Mostly we had the same sort of insight Socrates claimed:
we at least knew we knew nothing.  What made YC successful was being
able to pick good founders.  We thought Airbnb was a bad idea.  We
funded it because we liked the founders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During interviews, Robert and Trevor and I would pepper the applicants
with technical questions.  Jessica would mostly watch.  A lot of
the applicants probably read her as some kind of secretary, especially
early on, because she was the one who'd go out and get each new
group and she didn't ask many questions. She was ok with that.  It
was easier for her to watch people if they didn't notice her. But
after the interview, the three of us would turn to Jessica and ask
"What does the Social Radar say?"
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/jessica.html#f1n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Having the Social Radar at interviews wasn't just how we picked
founders who'd be successful.  It was also how we picked founders
who were good people.  At first we did this because we couldn't
help it.  Imagine what it would feel like to have x-ray vision for
character.  Being around bad people would be intolerable.  So we'd
refuse to fund founders whose characters we had doubts about even
if we thought they'd be successful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though we initially did this out of self-indulgence, it turned out
to be very valuable to YC.  We didn't realize it in the beginning,
but the people we were picking would become the YC alumni network.
And once we picked them, unless they did something really egregious,
they were going to be part of it for life. Some now think YC's
alumni network is its most valuable feature. I personally think
YC's advice is pretty good too, but the alumni network is certainly
among the most valuable features.  The level of trust and helpfulness
is remarkable for a group of such size.  And Jessica is the main
reason why.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(As we later learned, it probably cost us little to reject people
whose characters we had doubts about, because how good founders are
and how well they do are &lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/mean.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;not orthogonal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  If bad founders succeed
at all, they tend to sell early.  The most successful founders are
almost all good.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If Jessica was so important to YC, why don't more people realize
it?  Partly because I'm a writer, and writers always get disproportionate
attention.  YC's brand was initially my brand, and our applicants
were people who'd read my essays.  But there is another reason:
Jessica hates attention.  Talking to reporters makes her nervous.
The thought of giving a talk paralyzes her.  She was even uncomfortable
at our wedding, because the bride is always the center of attention.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/jessica.html#f2n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's not just because she's shy that she hates attention, but because
it throws off the Social Radar. She can't be herself. You can't
watch people when everyone is watching you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another reason attention worries her is that she hates bragging.
In anything she does that's publicly visible, her biggest fear
(after the obvious fear that it will be bad) is that it will seem
ostentatious.  She says being too modest is a common problem for
women.  But in her case it goes beyond that.  She has a horror of
ostentation so visceral it's almost a phobia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She also hates fighting. She can't do it; she just shuts down.  And
unfortunately there is a good deal of fighting in being the public
face of an organization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So although Jessica more than anyone made YC unique, the very
qualities that enabled her to do it mean she tends to get written
out of YC's history.  Everyone buys this story that PG started YC
and his wife just kind of helped.  Even YC's haters buy it.  A
couple years ago when people were attacking us for not funding more
female founders (than exist), they all treated YC as identical with
PG.  It would have spoiled the narrative to acknowledge Jessica's
central role at YC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jessica was boiling mad that people were accusing &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt; company of
sexism. I've never seen her angrier about anything.  But she did
not contradict them.  Not publicly.  In private there was a great
deal of profanity.  And she wrote three separate essays about the
question of female founders.  But she could never bring herself to
publish any of them.  She'd seen the level of vitriol in this debate,
and she shrank from engaging.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/jessica.html#f3n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It wasn't just because she disliked fighting.  She's so sensitive
to character that it repels her even to fight with dishonest people.
The idea of mixing it up with linkbait journalists or Twitter trolls
would seem to her not merely frightening, but disgusting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But Jessica knew her example as a successful female founder would
encourage more women to start companies, so last year she did
something YC had never done before and hired a PR firm to get her
some interviews.  At one of the first she did, the reporter brushed
aside her insights about startups and turned it into a sensationalistic
story about how some guy had tried to chat her up as she was waiting
outside the bar where they had arranged to meet.  Jessica was
mortified, partly because the guy had done nothing wrong, but more
because the story treated her as a victim significant only for being
a woman, rather than one of the most knowledgeable investors in the
Valley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After that she told the PR firm to stop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're not going to be hearing in the press about what Jessica has
achieved. So let me tell you what Jessica has achieved.  
is fundamentally a nexus of people, like a university. It doesn't
make a product. What defines it is the people.  Jessica more than
anyone curated and nurtured that collection of people.  In that
sense she literally made YC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jessica knows more about the qualities of startup founders than
anyone else ever has. Her immense data set and x-ray vision are the
perfect storm in that respect.  The qualities of the founders are
the best predictor of how a startup will do.  And startups are in
turn the most important source of growth in mature economies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The person who knows the most about the most important factor in
the growth of mature economies — that is who Jessica Livingston is.
Doesn't that sound like someone who should be better known?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f1n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Harj Taggar reminded me that while Jessica didn't ask many
questions, they tended to be important ones:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"She was always good at sniffing out any red flags about the team
or their determination and disarmingly asking the right question,
which usually revealed more than the founders realized."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f2n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Or more precisely, while she likes getting attention in the
sense of getting credit for what she has done, she doesn't like
getting attention in the sense of being watched in real time.
Unfortunately, not just for her but for a lot of people, how much
you get of the former depends a lot on how much you get of the
latter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Incidentally, if you saw Jessica at a public event, you would never
guess she
hates attention, because (a) she is very polite and (b) when she's
nervous, she expresses it by smiling more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f3n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
The existence of people like Jessica is not just something
the mainstream media needs to learn to acknowledge, but something
feminists need to learn to acknowledge as well.  There are successful
women who don't like to fight.  Which means if the public conversation
about women consists of fighting, their voices will be silenced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's a sort of Gresham's Law of conversations. If a conversation
reaches a certain level of incivility, the more thoughtful people
start to leave. No one understands female founders better than
Jessica.  But it's unlikely anyone will ever hear her speak candidly
about the topic. She ventured a toe in that water a while ago, and
the reaction was so violent that she decided "never again."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Thanks&lt;/b&gt; to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Patrick Collison, 
Daniel Gackle, Carolynn
Levy, Jon Levy, Kirsty Nathoo, Robert Morris, Geoff Ralston, and
Harj Taggar for reading drafts of this.  And yes, Jessica Livingston,
who made me cut surprisingly little.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</content:encoded>

it's possible to detect bias in a selection process without knowing

      <content:encoded>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;October 2015&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This will come as a surprise to a lot of people, but in some cases
it's possible to detect bias in a selection process without knowing
anything about the applicant pool.  Which is exciting because among
other things it means third parties can use this technique to detect
bias whether those doing the selecting want them to or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can use this technique whenever (a) you have at least
a random sample of the applicants that were selected, (b) their
subsequent performance is measured, and (c) the groups of
applicants you're comparing have roughly equal distribution of ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How does it work?  Think about what it means to be biased.  What
it means for a selection process to be biased against applicants
of type x is that it's harder for them to make it through.  Which
means applicants of type x have to be better to get selected than
applicants not of type x.
&lt;font color="#dddddd"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/bias.html#f1n"&gt;&lt;font color="#dddddd"&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;
Which means applicants of type x
who do make it through the selection process will outperform other
successful applicants.  And if the performance of all the successful
applicants is measured, you'll know if they do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, the test you use to measure performance must be a valid
one.  And in particular it must not be invalidated by the bias you're
trying to measure.
But there are some domains where performance can be measured, and
in those detecting bias is straightforward. Want to know if the
selection process was biased against some type of applicant?  Check
whether they outperform the others.  This is not just a heuristic
for detecting bias.  It's what bias means.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example, many suspect that venture capital firms are biased
against female founders. This would be easy to detect: among their
portfolio companies, do startups with female founders outperform
those without?  A couple months ago, one VC firm (almost certainly
unintentionally) published a study showing bias of this type. First
Round Capital found that among its portfolio companies, startups
with female founders &lt;a href="http://10years.firstround.com/#one"&gt;&lt;u&gt;outperformed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
those without by 63%. 
&lt;font color="#dddddd"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/bias.html#f2n"&gt;&lt;font color="#dddddd"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The reason I began by saying that this technique would come as a
surprise to many people is that we so rarely see analyses of this
type.  I'm sure it will come as a surprise to First Round that they
performed one. I doubt anyone there realized that by limiting their
sample to their own portfolio, they were producing a study not of
startup trends but of their own biases when selecting companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I predict we'll see this technique used more in the future.  The
information needed to conduct such studies is increasingly available.
Data about who applies for things is usually closely guarded by the
organizations selecting them, but nowadays data about who gets
selected is often publicly available to anyone who takes the trouble
to aggregate it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f1n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
This technique wouldn't work if the selection process looked
for different things from different types of applicants—for
example, if an employer hired men based on their ability but women
based on their appearance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f2n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
As Paul Buchheit points out, First Round excluded their most 
successful investment, Uber, from the study.  And while it 
makes sense to exclude outliers from some types of studies, 
studies of returns from startup investing, which is all about 
hitting outliers, are not one of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

      <title>Write Like You Talk</title>
      <link>https://paulgraham.com//talk.html</link>
      <description>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;October 2015&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here's a simple trick for getting more people to read what you
write: write in spoken language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Something comes over most people when they start writing. They write
in a different language than they'd use if they were talking to a
friend. The sentence structure and even the words are different.
No one uses "pen" as a verb in spoken English. You'd feel like an
idiot using "pen" instead of "write" in a conversation with a friend.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;br&lt;/font&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;October 2015&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here's a simple trick for getting more people to read what you
write: write in spoken language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Something comes over most people when they start writing. They write
in a different language than they'd use if they were talking to a
friend. The sentence structure and even the words are different.
No one uses "pen" as a verb in spoken English. You'd feel like an
idiot using "pen" instead of "write" in a conversation with a friend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last straw for me was a sentence I read a couple days ago:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  The mercurial Spaniard himself declared: "After Altamira, all is
  decadence."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It's from Neil Oliver's &lt;i&gt;A History of Ancient Britain&lt;/i&gt;. I feel bad
making an example of this book, because it's no worse than lots of
others.  But just imagine calling Picasso "the mercurial Spaniard" when
talking to a friend.  Even one
sentence of this would raise eyebrows in conversation.  And yet
people write whole books of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ok, so written and spoken language are different. Does that make
written language worse?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you want people to read and understand what you write, yes.
Written language is more complex, which makes it more work to read.
It's also more formal and distant, which gives the reader's attention
permission to drift.  But perhaps worst of all, the complex sentences
and fancy words give you, the writer, the false impression that
you're saying more than you actually are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You don't need complex sentences to express complex ideas.  When
specialists in some abstruse topic talk to one another about ideas
in their field, they don't use sentences any more complex than they
do when talking about what to have for lunch.  They use different
words, certainly.  But even those they use no more than necessary.
And in my experience, the harder the subject, the more informally
experts speak. Partly, I think, because they have less to prove,
and partly because the harder the ideas you're talking about, the
less you can afford to let language get in the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Informal language is the athletic clothing of ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I'm not saying spoken language always works best. Poetry is as much
music as text, so you can say things you wouldn't say in conversation.
And there are a handful of writers who can get away with using fancy
language in prose. And then of course there are cases where writers
don't want to make it easy to understand what they're saying—in
corporate announcements of bad news, for example, or at the more
&lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;amp;as_sdt=1,5&amp;amp;q=transgression+narrative+postmodern+gender"&gt;&lt;u&gt;bogus&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; end of the humanities.  But for nearly everyone else, spoken
language is better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It seems to be hard for most people to write in spoken language.
So perhaps the best solution is to write your first draft the way
you usually would, then afterward look at each sentence and ask "Is
this the way I'd say this if I were talking to a friend?" If it
isn't, imagine what you would say, and use that instead.  After a
while this filter will start to operate as you write. When you write
something you wouldn't say, you'll hear the clank as it hits the
page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before I publish a new essay, I read it out loud and fix everything
that doesn't sound like conversation. I even fix bits that are
phonetically awkward; I don't know if that's necessary, but it
doesn't cost much.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This trick may not always be enough.  I've seen writing so far
removed from spoken language that it couldn't be fixed sentence by
sentence.  For cases like that there's a more drastic solution.
After writing the first draft, try explaining to a friend what you
just wrote. Then replace the draft with what you said to your friend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People often tell me how much my essays sound like me talking.
The fact that this seems worthy of comment shows how rarely people
manage to write in spoken language.  Otherwise everyone's writing
would sound like them talking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you simply manage to write in spoken language, you'll be ahead
of 95% of writers.  And it's so easy to do: just don't let a sentence
through unless it's the way you'd say it to a friend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thanks&lt;/b&gt; to Patrick Collison and Jessica Livingston for reading drafts of this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Default Alive or Default Dead?</title>
      <link>https://paulgraham.com//aord.html</link>
      <description>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;October 2015&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When I talk to a startup that's been operating for more than 8 or
9 months, the first thing I want to know is almost always the same.
Assuming their expenses remain constant and their revenue growth
is what it has been over the last several months, do they make it to

      <content:encoded>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;October 2015&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When I talk to a startup that's been operating for more than 8 or
9 months, the first thing I want to know is almost always the same.
Assuming their expenses remain constant and their revenue growth
is what it has been over the last several months, do they make it to
profitability on the money they have left?  Or to put it more
dramatically, by default do they live or die?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The startling thing is how often the founders themselves don't know.
Half the founders I talk to don't know whether they're default alive
or default dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you're among that number, Trevor Blackwell has made a handy
&lt;a href="http://growth.tlb.org/#"&gt;&lt;u&gt;calculator&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; you can use to find out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The reason I want to know first whether a startup is default alive
or default dead is that the rest of the conversation depends on the
answer.  If the company is default alive, we can talk about ambitious
new things they could do.  If it's default dead, we probably need
to talk about how to save it.  We know the current trajectory ends
badly.  How can they get off that trajectory?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why do so few founders know whether they're default alive or default
dead?  Mainly, I think, because they're not used to asking that.
It's not a question that makes sense to ask early on, any more than
it makes sense to ask a 3 year old how he plans to support
himself.  But as the company grows older, the question switches from
meaningless to critical.  That kind of switch often takes people
by surprise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I propose the following solution: instead of starting to ask too
late whether you're default alive or default dead, start asking too
early.  It's hard to say precisely when the question switches
polarity.  But it's probably not that dangerous to start worrying
too early that you're default dead, whereas it's very dangerous to
start worrying too late.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The reason is a phenomenon I wrote about earlier: the
&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/pinch.html"&gt;fatal pinch&lt;/a&gt;.
The fatal pinch is default dead + slow growth + not enough
time to fix it.  And the way founders end up in it is by not realizing
that's where they're headed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is another reason founders don't ask themselves whether they're
default alive or default dead: they assume it will be easy to raise
more money.  But that assumption is often false, and worse still, the
more you depend on it, the falser it becomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maybe it will help to separate facts from hopes. Instead of thinking
of the future with vague optimism, explicitly separate the components.
Say "We're default dead, but we're counting on investors to save
us." Maybe as you say that, it will set off the same alarms in your
head that it does in mine.  And if you set off the alarms sufficiently
early, you may be able to avoid the fatal pinch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It would be safe to be default dead if you could count on investors
saving you.  As a rule their interest is a function of
growth.  If you have steep revenue growth, say over 5x a year, you
can start to count on investors being interested even if you're not
profitable.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/aord.html#f1n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;
But investors are so fickle that you can never
do more than start to count on them.  Sometimes something about your
business will spook investors even if your growth is great.  So no
matter how good your growth is, you can never safely treat fundraising
as more than a plan A. You should always have a plan B as well: you
should know (as in write down) precisely what you'll need to do to
survive if you can't raise more money, and precisely when you'll 
have to switch to plan B if plan A isn't working.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In any case, growing fast versus operating cheaply is far from the
sharp dichotomy many founders assume it to be.  In practice there
is surprisingly little connection between how much a startup spends
and how fast it grows.  When a startup grows fast, it's usually
because the product hits a nerve, in the sense of hitting some big
need straight on.  When a startup spends a lot, it's usually because
the product is expensive to develop or sell, or simply because
they're wasteful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you're paying attention, you'll be asking at this point not just
how to avoid the fatal pinch, but how to avoid being default dead.
That one is easy: don't hire too fast.  Hiring too fast is by far
the biggest killer of startups that raise money.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/aord.html#f2n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Founders tell themselves they need to hire in order to grow.  But
most err on the side of overestimating this need rather than
underestimating it.  Why?  Partly because there's so much work to
do.  Naive founders think that if they can just hire enough
people, it will all get done.  Partly because successful startups have
lots of employees, so it seems like that's what one does in order
to be successful.  In fact the large staffs of successful startups
are probably more the effect of growth than the cause.  And
partly because when founders have slow growth they don't want to
face what is usually the real reason: the product is not appealing
enough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plus founders who've just raised money are often encouraged to
overhire by the VCs who funded them.  Kill-or-cure strategies are
optimal for VCs because they're protected by the portfolio effect.
VCs want to blow you up, in one sense of the phrase or the other.
But as a founder your incentives are different.  You want above all
to survive.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/aord.html#f3n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here's a common way startups die.  They make something moderately
appealing and have decent initial growth. They raise their first
round fairly easily, because the founders seem smart and the idea
sounds plausible. But because the product is only moderately
appealing, growth is ok but not great.  The founders convince
themselves that hiring a bunch of people is the way to boost growth.
Their investors agree.  But (because the product is only moderately
appealing) the growth never comes.  Now they're rapidly running out
of runway.  They hope further investment will save them. But because
they have high expenses and slow growth, they're now unappealing
to investors. They're unable to raise more, and the company dies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What the company should have done is address the fundamental problem:
that the product is only moderately appealing.  Hiring people is
rarely the way to fix that.  More often than not it makes it harder.
At this early stage, the product needs to evolve more than to be
"built out," and that's usually easier with fewer people.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/aord.html#f4n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;4&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Asking whether you're default alive or default dead may save you
from this.  Maybe the alarm bells it sets off will counteract the
forces that push you to overhire.  Instead you'll be compelled to
seek growth in other ways. For example, by &lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/ds.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;doing
things that don't scale&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or by redesigning the product in the
way only founders can.
And for many if not most startups, these paths to growth will be
the ones that actually work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Airbnb waited 4 months after raising money at the end of Y Combinator
before they hired their first employee.  In the meantime the founders
were terribly overworked.  But they were overworked evolving Airbnb
into the astonishingly successful organism it is now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f1n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Steep usage growth will also interest investors.  Revenue
will ultimately be a constant multiple of usage, so x% usage growth
predicts x% revenue growth.  But in practice investors discount
merely predicted revenue, so if you're measuring usage you need a
higher growth rate to impress investors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f2n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Startups that don't raise money are saved from hiring too
fast because they can't afford to. But that doesn't mean you should
avoid raising money in order to avoid this problem, any more than
that total abstinence is the only way to avoid becoming an alcoholic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f3n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
I would not be surprised if VCs' tendency to push founders
to overhire is not even in their own interest.  They don't know how
many of the companies that get killed by overspending might have
done well if they'd survived.  My guess is a significant number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f4n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;4&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
After reading a draft, Sam Altman wrote:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"I think you should make the hiring point more strongly.  I think
it's roughly correct to say that YC's most successful companies
have never been the fastest to hire, and one of the marks of a great
founder is being able to resist this urge."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paul Buchheit adds:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"A related problem that I see a lot is premature scaling—founders
take a small business that isn't really working (bad unit economics,
typically) and then scale it up because they want impressive growth
numbers. This is similar to over-hiring in that it makes the business
much harder to fix once it's big, plus they are bleeding cash really
fast."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Thanks&lt;/b&gt; to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Joe Gebbia, Jessica Livingston,
and Geoff Ralston for reading drafts of this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Why It's Safe for Founders to Be Nice</title>
      <link>https://paulgraham.com//safe.html</link>
      <description>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;August 2015&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I recently got an email from a founder that helped me understand
something important: why it's safe for startup founders to be nice
people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I grew up with a cartoon idea of a very successful businessman (in
the cartoon it was always a man): a rapacious, cigar-smoking,
table-thumping guy in his fifties who wins by exercising power, and
isn't too fussy about how.  As I've written before, one of
the things that has surprised me most about &lt;/font&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;August 2015&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I recently got an email from a founder that helped me understand
something important: why it's safe for startup founders to be nice
people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I grew up with a cartoon idea of a very successful businessman (in
the cartoon it was always a man): a rapacious, cigar-smoking,
table-thumping guy in his fifties who wins by exercising power, and
isn't too fussy about how.  As I've written before, one of
the things that has surprised me most about startups is 
&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/mean.html"&gt;how few&lt;/a&gt; of
the most successful founders are like that.  Maybe successful people
in other industries are; I don't know; but not startup founders.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/safe.html#f1n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I knew this empirically, but I never saw the math of why till I got
this founder's email.  In it he said he worried that he was
fundamentally soft-hearted and tended to give away too much for
free. He thought perhaps he needed "a little dose of sociopath-ness."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I told him not to worry about it, because so long as he built
something good enough to spread by word of mouth, he'd have a
superlinear growth curve.  If he was bad at extracting money from
people, at worst this curve would be some constant multiple less
than 1 of what it might have been.  But a constant multiple of any
curve is exactly the same shape.  The numbers on the Y axis are
smaller, but the curve is just as steep, and when anything grows
at the rate of a successful startup, the Y axis will take care of
itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some examples will make this clear.  Suppose your company is making
$1000 a month now, and you've made something so great that it's
growing at 5% a week.  Two years from now, you'll be making about
$160k a month.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now suppose you're so un-rapacious that you only extract half as
much from your users as you could.  That means two years later
you'll be making $80k a month instead of $160k.  How far behind are
you? How long will it take to catch up with where you'd have been
if you were extracting every penny?  A mere 15 weeks.  After two
years, the un-rapacious founder is only 3.5 months behind the
rapacious one. 
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/safe.html#f2n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you're going to optimize a number, the one to choose is your
&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/growth.html"&gt;growth rate&lt;/a&gt;. Suppose as before that you only extract half as much
from users as you could, but that you're able to grow 6% a week
instead of 5%.  Now how are you doing compared to the rapacious
founder after two years?  You're already ahead—$214k a month
versus $160k—and pulling away fast.  In another year you'll be
making $4.4 million a month to the rapacious founder's $2 million.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Obviously one case where it would help to be rapacious is when
growth depends on that.  What makes startups different is that
usually it doesn't. Startups usually win by making something so
great that people recommend it to their friends.  And being rapacious
not only doesn't help you do that, but probably hurts.  
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/safe.html#f3n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The reason startup founders can safely be nice is that making great
things is compounded, and rapacity isn't.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So if you're a founder, here's a deal you can make with yourself
that will both make you happy and make your company successful.
Tell yourself you can be as nice as you want, so long as you work
hard on your growth rate to compensate.  Most successful startups
make that tradeoff unconsciously. Maybe if you do it consciously
you'll do it even better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f1n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Many think successful startup founders are driven by money.
In fact the secret weapon of the most successful founders is that
they aren't.  If they were, they'd have taken one of the acquisition
offers that every fast-growing startup gets on the way up.  What
drives the most successful founders is the same thing that drives
most people who make things: the company is their project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f2n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
In fact since 2 ≈ 1.05 ^ 15, the un-rapacious founder is
always 15 weeks behind the rapacious one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f3n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
The other reason it might help to be good at squeezing money
out of customers is that startups usually lose money at first, and
making more per customer makes it easier to get to profitability
before your initial funding runs out.  But while it is very common
for startups to &lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/pinch.html"&gt;die&lt;/a&gt;
from running through their initial funding and then being unable
to raise more, the underlying cause is usually slow growth or
excessive spending rather than insufficient effort to extract money
from existing customers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thanks&lt;/b&gt; to Sam Altman, Harj Taggar, Jessica Livingston, and
Geoff Ralston for reading drafts of this, and to Randall Bennett
for being such a nice guy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Change Your Name</title>

      <description>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;August 2015&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have a US startup called X and you don't have x.com, you
should probably change your name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The reason is not just that people can't find you.  For companies
with mobile apps, especially, having the right domain name is not
as critical as it used to be for getting users.  The problem with
not having the .com of your name is that it signals weakness.  Unless
you're so big that your reputation precedes you, a marginal domain
suggest&lt;/font&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;August 2015&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have a US startup called X and you don't have x.com, you
should probably change your name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The reason is not just that people can't find you.  For companies
with mobile apps, especially, having the right domain name is not
as critical as it used to be for getting users.  The problem with
not having the .com of your name is that it signals weakness.  Unless
you're so big that your reputation precedes you, a marginal domain
suggests you're a marginal company.  Whereas
(as Stripe shows)
having x.com signals strength even if it has no relation to what you
do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even good founders can be in denial about this.  Their denial derives
from two very powerful forces: identity, and lack of imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;X is what we &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt;, founders think. There's no other name as good.
Both of which are false.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can fix the first by stepping back from the problem. Imagine
you'd called your company something else.  If you had, surely you'd
be just as attached to that name as you are to your current one.
The idea of switching to your current name would seem repellent.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/name.html#f1n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's nothing intrinsically great about your current name.  Nearly
all your attachment to it comes from it being attached to you.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/name.html#f1n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The way to neutralize the second source of denial, your inability
to think of other potential names, is to acknowledge that you're
bad at naming.  Naming is a completely separate skill from those
you need to be a good founder.  You can be a great startup founder
but hopeless at thinking of names for your company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you acknowledge that, you stop believing there is nothing else
you could be called.  There are lots of other potential names that
are as good or better; you just can't think of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How do you find them? One answer is the default way to solve
problems you're bad at: find someone else who can think of names.
But with company names there is another possible
approach.  It turns out almost any word or word pair that is not
an obviously bad name is a sufficiently good one, and the number
of such domains is so large that you can find plenty that are cheap
or even untaken.  So make a list and try to buy some.  That's what
&lt;a href="http://www.quora.com/How-did-Stripe-come-up-with-its-name?share=1"&gt;Stripe&lt;/a&gt; 
did.  (Their search also turned up parse.com, which their
friends at Parse took.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The reason I know that naming companies is a distinct skill orthogonal
to the others you need in a startup is that I happen to have it.
Back when I was running YC and did more office hours with startups,
I would often help them find new names.  80% of the time we could
find at least one good name in a 20 minute office hour slot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now when I do office hours I have to focus on more important
questions, like what the company is doing.  I tell them when they
need to change their name.  But I know the power of the forces that
have them in their grip, so I know most won't listen. 
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/name.html#f1n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are of course examples of startups that have succeeded without
having the .com of their name.  There are startups that have succeeded despite any
number of different mistakes.  But this mistake is less excusable
than most.  It's something that can be fixed in a couple days if
you have sufficient discipline to acknowledge the problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;100% of the top 20 YC companies by valuation have the .com of their
name. 94% of the top 50 do. But only 66% of companies in the current
batch have the .com of their name. Which suggests there are lessons
ahead for most of the rest, one way or another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f1n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Incidentally, this thought experiment works for
&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/identity.html"&gt;nationality and religion&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f2n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
The liking you have for a name that has become part of your
identity manifests itself not directly, which would be easy to
discount, but as a collection of specious beliefs about its intrinsic
qualities.  (This too is true of nationality and religion as well.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f3n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Sometimes founders know it's a problem that they don't have
the .com of their name, but delusion strikes a step later in the belief that they'll
be able to buy it despite having no evidence it's for sale.  Don't
believe a domain is for sale unless the owner has already told you
an asking price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

      <title>What Microsoft Is this the Altair Basic of?</title>

      <description>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;February 2015&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most valuable exercises you can try if you want to
understand startups is to look at the most successful companies and
explain why they were not as lame as they seemed when they first
launched.  Because they practically all seemed lame at first. Not
just small, lame.  Not just the first step up a big mountain.  More
like the first step into a swamp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Basic interpreter for the Altair?  How could that ever grow into
a giant &lt;/font&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;February 2015&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most valuable exercises you can try if you want to
understand startups is to look at the most successful companies and

just small, lame.  Not just the first step up a big mountain.  More
like the first step into a swamp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Basic interpreter for the Altair?  How could that ever grow into
a giant company?  People sleeping on airbeds in strangers' apartments?
A web site for college students to stalk one another?  A wimpy
little single-board computer for hobbyists that used a TV as a
monitor?  A new search engine, when there were already about 10,
and they were all trying to de-emphasize search?  These ideas didn't
just seem small.  They seemed wrong.  They were the kind of ideas
you could not merely ignore, but ridicule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Often the founders themselves didn't know why their ideas were
promising.  They were attracted to these ideas by instinct, because
they were &lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html"&gt;living in the future&lt;/a&gt; and
they sensed that something was missing.  But they could not have
put into words exactly how their ugly ducklings were going to grow
into big, beautiful swans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most people's first impulse when they hear about a lame-sounding
new startup idea is to make fun of it.  Even a lot of people who
should know better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When I encounter a startup with a lame-sounding idea, I ask "What
Microsoft is this the Altair Basic of?"  Now it's a puzzle, and the
burden is on me to solve it.  Sometimes I can't think of an answer,
especially when the idea is a made-up one.  But it's remarkable how
often there does turn out to be an answer.  Often it's one the
founders themselves hadn't seen yet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intriguingly, there are sometimes multiple answers.  I talked to a
startup a few days ago that could grow into 3 distinct Microsofts.
They'd probably vary in size by orders of magnitude.  But you can
never predict how big a Microsoft is going to be, so in cases like
that I encourage founders to follow whichever path is most immediately
exciting to them.  Their instincts got them this far. Why stop now?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>The Ronco Principle</title>

      <description>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;January 2015&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No one, VC or angel, has invested in more of the top startups than
Ron Conway.  He knows what happened in every deal in the Valley,
half the time because he arranged it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And yet he's a super nice guy.  In fact, nice is not the word.
Ronco is good. I know of zero instances in which he has behaved
badly.  It's hard even to imagine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When I first came to Silicon Valley I thought "How lucky that someone

Ron Conway.  He knows what happened in every deal in the Valley,

Ronco is good. I know of zero instances in which he has behaved
badly.  It's hard even to imagine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When I first came to Silicon Valley I thought "How lucky that someone
so powerful is so benevolent."  But gradually I realized it wasn't
luck.  It was by being benevolent that Ronco became so powerful.
All the deals he gets to invest in come to him through referrals.
Google did. Facebook did. Twitter was a referral from Evan Williams
himself.  And the reason so many people refer deals to him is that
he's proven himself to be a good guy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good does not mean being a pushover.  I would not want to face an
angry Ronco.  But if Ron's angry at you, it's because you did
something wrong.  Ron is so old school he's Old Testament.  He will
smite you in his just wrath, but there's no malice in it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In almost every domain there are advantages to seeming good.  It
makes people trust you.  But actually being good is an expensive
way to seem good.  To an amoral person it might seem to be overkill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In some fields it might be, but apparently not in the startup world.
Though plenty of investors are jerks, there is a clear trend among
them: the most successful investors are also the most upstanding. 
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/ronco.html#f1n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was not always this way.  I would not feel confident saying that
about investors twenty years ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What changed?  The startup world became more transparent and more
unpredictable.  Both make it harder to seem good without actually
being good.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's obvious why transparency has that effect.  When an investor
maltreats a founder now, it gets out.  Maybe not all the way to the
press, but other founders hear about it, and that investor
starts to lose deals. 
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/ronco.html#f2n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The effect of unpredictability is more subtle.  It increases the
work of being inconsistent.  If you're going to be two-faced, you
have to know who you should be nice to and who you can get away
with being nasty to.  In the startup world, things change so rapidly
that you can't tell.  The random college kid you talk to today might
in a couple years be the CEO of the hottest startup in the Valley.
If you can't tell who to be nice to, you have to be nice to everyone.
And probably the only people who can manage that are the people who
are genuinely good.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a sufficiently connected and unpredictable world, you can't seem
good without being good.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As often happens, Ron discovered how to be the investor of the
future by accident.  He didn't foresee the future of startup
investing, realize it would pay to be upstanding, and force himself
to behave that way. It would feel unnatural to him to behave any
other way.  He was already 
&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html"&gt;living in the future&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fortunately that future is not limited to the startup world.  The
startup world is more transparent and unpredictable than most, but
almost everywhere the trend is in that direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f1n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
I'm not saying that if you sort investors by benevolence
you've also sorted them by returns, but rather that if you do a
scatterplot with benevolence on the x axis and returns on the y,
you'd see a clear upward trend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f2n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Y Combinator in particular, because it aggregates data
from so many startups, has a pretty comprehensive view of
investor behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

for Westinghouse, modelling nuclear reactors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He was one of those lucky people who know early on what they want to

for Westinghouse, modelling nuclear reactors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He was one of those lucky people who know early on what they want to
do.  When you talk to him about his childhood, there's a clear
watershed at about age 12, when he "got interested in maths."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He
grew up in the small Welsh seacoast town of &lt;a href="https://goo.gl/maps/rkzUm"&gt;Pwllheli&lt;/a&gt;.  As we retraced
his walk to school on Google Street View, he said that it had been
nice growing up in the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Didn't it get boring when you got to be about 15?" I asked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"No," he said, "by then I was interested in maths."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In another conversation he told me that what he really liked was
solving problems.  To me the exercises at the end of each chapter
in a math textbook represent work, or at best a way to reinforce
what you learned in that chapter.  To him the problems were the
reward.  The text of each chapter was just some advice about solving
them. He said that as soon as he got a new textbook he'd immediately
work out all the problems — to the slight annoyance of his teacher,
since the class was supposed to work through the book gradually.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Few people know so early or so certainly what they want to work on.
But talking to my father reminded me of a heuristic the rest of us
can use. If something that seems like work to other people doesn't
seem like work to you, that's something you're well suited for.
For example, a lot of programmers I know, including me, actually
like debugging.  It's not something people tend to volunteer; one
likes it the way one likes popping zits. But you may have to like
debugging to like programming, considering the degree to which
programming consists of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The stranger your tastes seem to other people, the stronger evidence
they probably are of what you should do. When I was in college I
used to write papers for my friends.  It was quite interesting to
write a paper for a class I wasn't taking.  Plus they were always
so relieved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It seemed curious that the same task could be painful to one person
and pleasant to another, but I didn't realize at the time what this
imbalance implied, because I wasn't looking for it.  I didn't realize
how hard it can be to decide what you should work on, and that you
sometimes have to &lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/love.html"&gt;figure it out&lt;/a&gt; from subtle clues, like a detective
solving a case in a mystery novel.  So I bet it would help a lot
of people to ask themselves about this explicitly. What seems like
work to other people that doesn't seem like work to you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

      <title>Don't Talk to Corp Dev</title>
      <link>https://paulgraham.com//corpdev.html</link>
      <description>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;January 2015&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Corporate Development, aka corp dev, is the group within companies
that buys other companies. If you're talking to someone from corp
dev, that's why, whether you realize it yet or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's usually a mistake to talk to corp dev unless (a) you want to
sell your company right now and (b) you're sufficiently likely to
get an offer at an acceptable price.  In practice that means startups
should only talk to corp dev when they're either doi&lt;/font&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;January 2015&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Corporate Development, aka corp dev, is the group within companies
that buys other companies. If you're talking to someone from corp
dev, that's why, whether you realize it yet or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's usually a mistake to talk to corp dev unless (a) you want to
sell your company right now and (b) you're sufficiently likely to
get an offer at an acceptable price.  In practice that means startups
should only talk to corp dev when they're either doing really well
or really badly.  If you're doing really badly, meaning the company
is about to die, you may as well talk to them, because you have
nothing to lose. And if you're doing really well, you can safely
talk to them, because you both know the price will have to be high,
and if they show the slightest sign of wasting your time, you'll
be confident enough to tell them to get lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The danger is to companies in the middle.  Particularly to young
companies that are growing fast, but haven't been doing it for long
enough to have grown big yet.  It's usually a mistake for a promising
company less than a year old even to talk to corp dev.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But it's a mistake founders constantly make.  When someone from
corp dev wants to meet, the founders tell themselves they should
at least find out what they want.  Besides, they don't want to
offend Big Company by refusing to meet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, I'll tell you what they want.  They want to talk about buying
you.  That's what the title "corp dev" means.   So before agreeing
to meet with someone from corp dev, ask yourselves, "Do we want to
sell the company right now?"  And if the answer is no, tell them
"Sorry, but we're focusing on growing the company."  They won't be
offended.  And certainly the founders of Big Company won't be
offended. If anything they'll think more highly of you.  You'll
remind them of themselves.  They didn't sell either; that's why
they're in a position now to buy other companies.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/corpdev.html#f1n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most founders who get contacted by corp dev already know what it
means.  And yet even when they know what corp dev does and know
they don't want to sell, they take the meeting.  Why do they do it?
The same mix of denial and wishful thinking that underlies most
mistakes founders make. It's flattering to talk to someone who wants
to buy you.  And who knows, maybe their offer will be surprisingly
high.  You should at least see what it is, right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No.  If they were going to send you an offer immediately by email,
sure, you might as well open it.  But that is not how conversations
with corp dev work.  If you get an offer at all, it will be at the
end of a long and unbelievably distracting process.  And if the
offer is surprising, it will be surprisingly low.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Distractions are the thing you can least afford in a startup.  And
conversations with corp dev are the worst sort of distraction,
because as well as consuming your &lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/top.html"&gt;attention&lt;/a&gt; they undermine your
morale.  One of the tricks to surviving a grueling process is not
to stop and think how tired you are.  Instead you get into a sort
of flow. 
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/corpdev.html#f2n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;
Imagine what it would do to you if at mile 20 of a
marathon, someone ran up beside you and said "You must feel really
tired.  Would you like to stop and take a rest?"  Conversations
with corp dev are like that but worse, because the suggestion of
stopping gets combined in your mind with the imaginary high price
you think they'll offer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And then you're really in trouble.  If they can, corp dev people
like to turn the tables on you. They like to get you to the point
where you're trying to convince them to buy instead of them trying
to convince you to sell.  And surprisingly often they succeed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a very slippery slope, greased with some of the most powerful
forces that can work on founders' minds, and attended by an experienced
professional whose full time job is to push you down it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their tactics in pushing you down that slope are usually fairly
brutal. Corp dev people's whole job is to buy companies, and they
don't even get to choose which.  The only way their performance is
measured is by how cheaply they can buy you, and the more ambitious
ones will stop at nothing to achieve that. For example, they'll
almost always start with a lowball offer, just to see if you'll
take it. Even if you don't, a low initial offer will demoralize you
and make you easier to manipulate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And that is the most innocent of their tactics. Just wait till
you've agreed on a price and think you have a done deal, and then
they come back and say their boss has vetoed the deal and won't do
it for more than half the agreed upon price. Happens all the time.
If you think investors can behave badly, it's nothing compared to
what corp dev people can do.  Even corp dev people at companies
that are otherwise benevolent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I remember once complaining to a
friend at Google about some nasty trick their corp dev people had
pulled on a YC startup.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"What happened to Don't be Evil?" I asked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"I don't think corp dev got the memo," he replied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tactics you encounter in M&amp;amp;A conversations can be like nothing
you've experienced in the otherwise comparatively 
&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/mean.html"&gt;upstanding&lt;/a&gt; world
of Silicon Valley.  It's as if a chunk of genetic material from the
old-fashioned robber baron business world got incorporated into the
startup world.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/corpdev.html#f3n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The simplest way to protect yourself is to use the trick that John
D. Rockefeller, whose grandfather was an alcoholic, used to protect
himself from becoming one.  He once told a Sunday school class
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Boys, do you know why I never became a drunkard?  Because I never
  took the first drink.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Do you want to sell your company right now?  Not eventually, right
now.  If not, just don't take the first meeting.  They won't be
offended.  And you in turn will be guaranteed to be spared one of
the worst experiences that can happen to a startup.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you do want to sell, there's another set of 
&lt;a href="https://justinkan.com/the-founders-guide-to-selling-your-company-a1b2025c9481"&gt;techniques
&lt;/a&gt; for doing
that.  But the biggest mistake founders make in dealing with corp
dev is not doing a bad job of talking to them when they're ready
to, but talking to them before they are.  So if you remember only
the title of this essay, you already know most of what you need to
know about M&amp;amp;A in the first year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f1n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
I'm not saying you should never sell.  I'm saying you should
be clear in your own mind about whether you want to sell or not,
and not be led by manipulation or wishful thinking into trying to
sell earlier than you otherwise would have.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f2n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
In a startup, as in most competitive sports, the task at hand
almost does this for you; you're too busy to feel tired.  But when
you lose that protection, e.g. at the final whistle, the fatigue
hits you like a wave.  To talk to corp dev is to let yourself feel
it mid-game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f3n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
To be fair, the apparent misdeeds of corp dev people are magnified
by the fact that they function as the face of a large organization
that often doesn't know its own mind.  Acquirers can be surprisingly
indecisive about acquisitions, and their flakiness is indistinguishable
from dishonesty by the time it filters down to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thanks&lt;/b&gt; to Marc Andreessen, Jessica Livingston, Geoff
Ralston, and Qasar Younis for reading drafts of this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;December 2014&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;American technology companies want the government to make immigration
easier because they say they can't find enough programmers in the
US.  Anti-immigration people say that instead of letting foreigners
take these jobs, we should train more Americans to be programmers.
Who's right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technology companies are right. What the anti-immigration people
don't understand is that there is a huge variation in ability between
competent programmers and exceptional ones, and while you can train
people to be competent, you can't train them to be exceptional.
Exceptional programmers have an aptitude for and 
&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/genius.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;interest in&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
programming that is not merely the product of training.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/95.html#f1n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The US has less than 5% of the world's population.  Which means if
the qualities that make someone a great programmer are evenly
distributed, 95% of great programmers are born outside the US.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The anti-immigration people have to invent some explanation to
account for all the effort technology companies have expended trying
to make immigration easier.  So they claim it's because they want
to drive down salaries.  But if you talk to startups, you find
practically every one over a certain size has gone through legal
contortions to get programmers into the US, where they then
paid them the same as they'd have paid an American.  Why would they
go to extra trouble to get programmers for the same price?  The
only explanation is that they're telling the truth: there are just
not enough great programmers to go around.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/95.html#f2n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I asked the CEO of a startup with about 70 programmers how many
more he'd hire if he could get all the great programmers he wanted.
He said "We'd hire 30 tomorrow morning."  And this is one of the
hot startups that always win recruiting battles. It's the same all
over Silicon Valley.  Startups are that constrained for talent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It would be great if more Americans were trained as programmers,
but no amount of training can flip a ratio as overwhelming as 95
to 5. Especially since programmers are being trained in other
countries too.  Barring some cataclysm, it will always be true that
most great programmers are born outside the US.  It will always be
true that most people who are great at anything are born outside
the US.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/95.html#f3n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exceptional performance implies immigration.  A country with only
a few percent of the world's population will be exceptional in some
field only if there are a lot of immigrants working in it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But this whole discussion has taken something for granted: that if
we let more great programmers into the US, they'll want to come.
That's true now, and we don't realize how lucky we are that it is.
If we want to keep this option open, the best way to do it is to
take advantage of it: the more of the world's great programmers are
here, the more the rest will want to come here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And if we don't, the US could be seriously fucked. I realize that's
strong language, but the people dithering about this don't seem to
realize the power of the forces at work here.  Technology gives the
best programmers huge leverage.  The world market in programmers
seems to be becoming dramatically more liquid.  And since good
people like good colleagues, that means the best programmers could
collect in just a few hubs.  Maybe mostly in one hub.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What if most of the great programmers collected in one hub, and it
wasn't here?  That scenario may seem unlikely now, but it won't be
if things change as much in the next 50 years as they did in the
last 50.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have the potential to ensure that the US remains a technology
superpower just by letting in a few thousand great programmers a
year.  What a colossal mistake it would be to let that opportunity
slip.  It could easily be the defining mistake this generation of
American politicians later become famous for.  And unlike other
potential mistakes on that scale, it costs nothing to fix.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So please, get on with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f1n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
How much better is a great programmer than an ordinary one?
So much better that you can't even measure the difference directly.
A great programmer doesn't merely do the same work faster.  A great
programmer will invent things an ordinary programmer would never
even think of.  This doesn't mean a great programmer is infinitely
more valuable, because any invention has a finite market value.
But it's easy to imagine cases where a great programmer might invent
things worth 100x or even 1000x an average programmer's salary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f2n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
There are a handful of consulting firms that rent out big
pools of foreign programmers they bring in on H1-B visas.  By all
means crack down on these.  It should be easy to write legislation
that distinguishes them, because they are so different from technology
companies.  But it is dishonest of the anti-immigration people to
claim that companies like Google and Facebook are driven by the
same motives.  An influx of inexpensive but mediocre programmers
is the last thing they'd want; it would destroy them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f3n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Though this essay talks about programmers, the group of people
we need to import is broader, ranging from designers to programmers
to electrical engineers.  The best one could do as a general term
might be "digital talent." It seemed better to make the argument a
little too narrow than to confuse everyone with a neologism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

confidence in our beliefs.  The more (and more varied) experience

      <content:encoded>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;December 2014&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the world were static, we could have monotonically increasing
confidence in our beliefs.  The more (and more varied) experience
a belief survived, the less likely it would be false.  Most people
implicitly believe something like this about their opinions.  And
they're justified in doing so with opinions about things that don't
change much, like human nature.  But you can't trust your opinions
in the same way about things that change, which could include
practically everything else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When experts are wrong, it's often because they're experts on an
earlier version of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is it possible to avoid that?  Can you protect yourself against
obsolete beliefs?  To some extent, yes. I spent almost a decade
investing in early stage startups, and curiously enough protecting
yourself against obsolete beliefs is exactly what you have to do
to succeed as a startup investor.  Most really good startup ideas
look like bad ideas at first, and many of those look bad specifically
because some change in the world just switched them from bad to
good.  I spent a lot of time learning to recognize such ideas, and
the techniques I used may be applicable to ideas in general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first step is to have an explicit belief in change.  People who
fall victim to a monotonically increasing confidence in their
opinions are implicitly concluding the world is static.  If you
consciously remind yourself it isn't, you start to look for change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where should one look for it?  Beyond the moderately useful
generalization that human nature doesn't change much, the unfortunate
fact is that change is hard to predict.  This is largely a tautology
but worth remembering all the same: change that matters usually
comes from an unforeseen quarter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So I don't even try to predict it.  When I get asked in interviews
to predict the future, I always have to struggle to come up with
something plausible-sounding on the fly, like a student who hasn't
prepared for an exam.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/ecw.html#f1n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;
But it's not out of laziness that I haven't
prepared.  It seems to me that beliefs about the future are so
rarely correct that they usually aren't worth the extra rigidity
they impose, and that the best strategy is simply to be aggressively
open-minded.  Instead of trying to point yourself in the right
direction, admit you have no idea what the right direction is, and
try instead to be super sensitive to the winds of change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's ok to have working hypotheses, even though they may constrain
you a bit, because they also motivate you.  It's exciting to chase
things and exciting to try to guess answers.  But you have to be
disciplined about not letting your hypotheses harden into anything
more.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/ecw.html#f2n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I believe this passive m.o. works not just for evaluating new ideas
but also for having them.  The way to come up with new ideas is not
to try explicitly to, but to try to solve problems and simply not
discount weird hunches you have in the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winds of change originate in the unconscious minds of domain
experts.  If you're sufficiently expert in a field, any weird idea
or apparently irrelevant question that occurs to you is ipso facto
worth exploring. 
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/ecw.html#f3n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;
 Within Y Combinator, when an idea is described
as crazy, it's a compliment—in fact, on average probably a
higher compliment than when an idea is described as good.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Startup investors have extraordinary incentives for correcting
obsolete beliefs.  If they can realize before other investors that
some apparently unpromising startup isn't, they can make a huge
amount of money.  But the incentives are more than just financial.
Investors' opinions are explicitly tested: startups come to them
and they have to say yes or no, and then, fairly quickly, they learn
whether they guessed right.  The investors who say no to a Google
(and there were several) will remember it for the rest of their
lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyone who must in some sense bet on ideas rather than merely
commenting on them has similar incentives.  Which means anyone who
wants such incentives can have them, by turning their comments into
bets: if you write about a topic in some fairly durable and public
form, you'll find you worry much more about getting things right
than most people would in a casual conversation.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/ecw.html#f4n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;4&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another trick I've found to protect myself against obsolete beliefs
is to focus initially on people rather than ideas. Though the nature
of future discoveries is hard to predict, I've found I can predict
quite well what sort of people will make them.  Good new ideas come
from earnest, energetic, independent-minded people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Betting on people over ideas saved me countless times as an investor.
We thought Airbnb was a bad idea, for example. But we could tell
the founders were earnest, energetic, and independent-minded.
(Indeed, almost pathologically so.)  So we suspended disbelief and
funded them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This too seems a technique that should be generally applicable.
Surround yourself with the sort of people new ideas come from.  If
you want to notice quickly when your beliefs become obsolete, you
can't do better than to be friends with the people whose discoveries
will make them so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's hard enough already not to become the prisoner of your own
expertise, but it will only get harder, because change is accelerating.
That's not a recent trend; change has been accelerating since the
paleolithic era.  Ideas beget ideas.  I don't expect that to change.
But I could be wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f1n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
My usual trick is to talk about aspects of the present that
most people haven't noticed yet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f2n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Especially if they become well enough known that people start
to identify them with you.  You have to be extra skeptical about
things you want to believe, and once a hypothesis starts to be
identified with you, it will almost certainly start to be in that
category.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f3n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
In practice "sufficiently expert" doesn't require one to be
recognized as an expert—which is a trailing indicator in any
case.  In many fields a year of focused work plus caring a lot would
be enough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f4n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;4&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Though they are public and persist indefinitely, comments on
e.g. forums and places like Twitter seem empirically to work like
casual conversation.  The threshold may be whether what you write
has a title.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

      <description>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;December 2014&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I've read Villehardouin's chronicle of the Fourth Crusade at least
two times, maybe three.  And yet if I had to write down everything
I remember from it, I doubt it would amount to much more than a
page.  Multiply this times several hundred, and I get an uneasy

      <content:encoded>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;December 2014&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I've read Villehardouin's chronicle of the Fourth Crusade at least
two times, maybe three.  And yet if I had to write down everything
I remember from it, I doubt it would amount to much more than a
page.  Multiply this times several hundred, and I get an uneasy
feeling when I look at my bookshelves. What use is it to read all
these books if I remember so little from them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few months ago, as I was reading Constance Reid's excellent
biography of Hilbert, I figured out if not the answer to this
question, at least something that made me feel better about it.
She writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Hilbert had no patience with mathematical lectures which filled
  the students with facts but did not teach them how to frame a
  problem and solve it. He often used to tell them that "a perfect
  formulation of a problem is already half its solution."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
That has always seemed to me an important point, and I was even
more convinced of it after hearing it confirmed by Hilbert.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But how had I come to believe in this idea in the first place?  A
combination of my own experience and other things I'd read.  None
of which I could at that moment remember!  And eventually I'd forget
that Hilbert had confirmed it too.  But my increased belief in the
importance of this idea would remain something I'd learned from
this book, even after I'd forgotten I'd learned it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reading and experience train your model of the world.  And even if
you forget the experience or what you read, its effect on your model
of the world persists.  Your mind is like a compiled program you've
lost the source of.  It works, but you don't know why.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The place to look for what I learned from Villehardouin's chronicle
is not what I remember from it, but my mental models of the crusades,
Venice, medieval culture, siege warfare, and so on.  Which doesn't
mean I couldn't have read more attentively, but at least the harvest
of reading is not so miserably small as it might seem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is one of those things that seem obvious in retrospect.  But
it was a surprise to me and presumably would be to anyone else who
felt uneasy about (apparently) forgetting so much they'd read.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Realizing it does more than make you feel a little better about
forgetting, though.  There are specific implications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example, reading and experience are usually "compiled" at the
time they happen, using the state of your brain at that time.  The
same book would get compiled differently at different points in
your life.  Which means it is very much worth reading important
books multiple times.  I always used to feel some misgivings about
rereading books.  I unconsciously lumped reading together with work
like carpentry, where having to do something again is a sign you
did it wrong the first time.  Whereas now the phrase "already read"
seems almost ill-formed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intriguingly, this implication isn't limited to books.  Technology
will increasingly make it possible to relive our experiences.  When
people do that today it's usually to enjoy them again (e.g. when
looking at pictures of a trip) or to find the origin of some bug in
their compiled code (e.g. when Stephen Fry succeeded in remembering
the childhood trauma that prevented him from singing).  But as
technologies for recording and playing back your life improve, it
may become common for people to relive experiences without any goal
in mind, simply to learn from them again as one might when rereading
a book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eventually we may be able not just to play back experiences but
also to index and even edit them. So although not knowing how you
know things may seem part of being human, it may not be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Thanks&lt;/b&gt; to Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading

      <title>The Fatal Pinch</title>
      <link>https://paulgraham.com//pinch.html</link>
      <description>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;December 2014&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many startups go through a point a few months before they die where
although they have a significant amount of money in the bank, they're
also losing a lot each month, and revenue growth is either nonexistent
or mediocre.  The company has, say, 6 months of runway.  Or to put
it more brutally, 6 months before they're out of business.  They
expect to avoid that by raising more from investors.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&amp;lt;a href="https://paulgraham.co&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;December 2014&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many startups go through a point a few months before they die where
although they have a significant amount of money in the bank, they're

or mediocre.  The company has, say, 6 months of runway.  Or to put
it more brutally, 6 months before they're out of business.  They
expect to avoid that by raising more from investors.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/pinch.html#f1n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That last sentence is the fatal one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There may be nothing founders are so prone to delude themselves
about as how interested investors will be in giving them additional
funding.  It's hard to convince investors the first time too, but
founders expect that.  What bites them the second time is a confluence
of three forces:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The company is spending more now than it did the first time
  it raised money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt; Investors have much higher standards for companies that have
  already raised money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt; The company is now starting to read as a failure. The first
  time it raised money, it was neither a success nor a failure; it
  was too early to ask. Now it's possible to ask that question, and
  the default answer is failure, because at this point that is the
  default outcome.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
I'm going to call the situation I described in the first paragraph "the fatal pinch." I try to resist
coining phrases, but making up a name for this situation may snap
founders into realizing when they're in it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the things that makes the fatal pinch so dangerous is
that it's self-reinforcing.  Founders overestimate their chances
of raising more money, and so are slack about reaching
profitability, which further decreases their chances of raising
money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now that you know about the fatal pinch, how do you avoid it?  Y Combinator tells
founders who raise money to act as if it's the last they'll ever
get.  Because the self-reinforcing nature of this situation works
the other way too: the less you need further investment, the easier
it is to get.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What do you do if you're already in the fatal pinch?  The
first step is to re-evaluate the probability of raising more money.
I will now, by an amazing feat of clairvoyance, do this for you:
the probability is zero. 
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/pinch.html#f2n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three options remain: you can shut down the company, you can increase
how much you make, and you can decrease how much you spend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You should shut down the company if you're certain it will
fail no matter what you do.  Then at least you can give back the
money you have left, and save yourself however many months you would
have spent riding it down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Companies rarely &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to fail though.  What I'm really doing
here is giving you the option of admitting you've already given up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you don't want to shut down the company, that leaves increasing
revenues and decreasing expenses.  In most startups, expenses =
people, and decreasing expenses = firing people.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/pinch.html#f3n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;
Deciding to
fire people is usually hard, but there's one case in which it
shouldn't be: when there are people you already know you should
fire but you're in denial about it.  If so, now's the time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If that makes you profitable, or will enable you to make it to
profitability on the money you have left, you've avoided the immediate
danger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Otherwise you have three options: you either have to fire good
people, get some or all of the employees to take less salary for a
while, or increase revenues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Getting people to take less salary is a weak solution that will
only work when the problem isn't too bad.  If your current trajectory
won't quite get you to profitability but you can get over the threshold
by cutting salaries a little,
you might be able to make the case to everyone for doing it.
Otherwise you're probably just postponing the problem, and that
will be obvious to the people whose salaries you're proposing to
cut.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/pinch.html#f4n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;4&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Which leaves two options, firing good people and making more money.
While trying to balance them, keep in mind the eventual goal: to be
a successful product company in the sense of having a single thing
lots of people use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You should lean more toward firing people if the source of your
trouble is overhiring. If you went out and hired 15 people before
you even knew what you were building, you've created a broken
company.  You need to figure out what you're building, and it will
probably be easier to do that with a handful of people than 15.
Plus those 15 people might not even be the ones you need for whatever
you end up building.  So the solution may be to shrink and then
figure out what direction to grow in.  After all, you're not doing
those 15 people any favors if you fly the company into ground with
them aboard.  They'll all lose their jobs eventually, along with
all the time they expended on this doomed company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whereas if you only have a handful of people, it may be better to
focus on trying to make more money.  It may seem facile to suggest
a startup make more money, as if that could be done for the asking.
Usually a startup is already trying as hard as it can to sell
whatever it sells.  What I'm suggesting here is not so much to try
harder to make money but to try to make money in a different way.
For example, if you have only one person selling while the rest are
writing code, consider having everyone work on selling.  What good
will more code do you when you're out of business?  
If you have to write code to close a certain deal, go ahead;
that follows from everyone working on selling.  But only work on
whatever will get you the most revenue the soonest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another way to make money differently is to sell different things,
and in particular to do more consultingish work.  I say consultingish
because there is a long slippery slope from making products to pure
consulting, and you don't have to go far down it before you start
to offer something really attractive to customers. Although your
product may not be very appealing yet, if you're a startup your
programmers will often be way better than the ones your customers
have.  Or you may have expertise in some new field they
don't understand.  So if you change your sales conversations
just a little from "do you want to buy our product?" to "what do
you need that you'd pay a lot for?" you may find it's suddenly a
lot easier to extract money from customers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be ruthlessly mercenary when you start doing this, though. You're
trying to save your company from death here, so make customers pay
a lot, quickly. And to the extent you can, try to avoid the
worst pitfalls of consulting.  The ideal thing might be if you built
a precisely defined derivative version of your product for the
customer, and it was otherwise a straight product sale.  You keep
the IP and no billing by the hour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the best case, this consultingish work may not be just something
you do to survive, but may turn out to be the &lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/ds.html"&gt;thing-that-doesn't-scale&lt;/a&gt; that defines your
company.  Don't expect it to be, but as you dive into individual
users' needs, keep your eyes open for narrow openings that have
wide vistas beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is usually so much demand for custom work that unless you're
really incompetent there has to be some point down the slope of
consulting at which you can survive.  But I didn't use the term
slippery slope by accident; customers' insatiable demand for custom
work will always be pushing you toward the bottom.  So while you'll
probably survive, the problem now becomes to survive with the least
damage and distraction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The good news is, plenty of successful startups have passed through
near-death experiences and gone on to flourish.  You just have to
realize in time that you're near death.  And if you're in the fatal pinch,
you are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f1n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
There are a handful of companies that can't reasonably expect
to make money for the first year or two, because what they're
building takes so long.  For these companies substitute "progress"
for "revenue growth."  You're not one of these companies unless
your initial investors agreed in advance that you were.  And frankly
even these companies wish they weren't, because the illiquidity of
"progress" puts them at the mercy of investors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f2n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
There's a variant of the fatal pinch where your existing
investors help you along by promising to invest more.  Or rather,
where you read them as promising to invest more, while they think
they're just mentioning the possibility.  The way to solve this
problem, if you have 8 months of runway or less, is to try to get
the money right now.  Then you'll either get the money, in which
case (immediate) problem solved, or at least prevent your investors
from helping you to remain in denial about your fundraising prospects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f3n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Obviously, if you have significant expenses other than salaries
that you can eliminate, do it now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f4n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;4&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Unless of course the source of the problem is that you're paying
yourselves high salaries.  If by cutting the founders' salaries to
the minimum you need, you can make it to profitability, you should.
But it's a bad sign if you needed to read this to realize that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

are mean.  There are exceptions, but remarkably few.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meanness isn't rare.  In fact, one of the things the internet has
shown us is how mean people can be.  A few decades ago, only famous

meanness that had previously been hidden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And yet while t&lt;/font&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;font face="verdana" size="2"&gt;November 2014&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It struck me recently how few of the most successful people I know

people and professional writers got to publish their opinions.  Now
everyone can, and we can all see the long tail of
meanness that had previously been hidden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And yet while there are clearly a lot of mean people out there,
there are next to none among the most successful people I know.
What's going on here?  Are meanness and success inversely correlated?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of what's going on, of course, is selection bias.  I only know
people who work in certain fields: startup founders, programmers,
professors. I'm willing to believe that successful people in other
fields are mean.  Maybe successful hedge fund managers are mean; I
don't know enough to say.  It seems quite likely that most successful
drug lords are mean.  But there are at least big chunks of the world
that mean people don't rule, and that territory seems to be growing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My wife and Y Combinator cofounder Jessica is one of those rare
people who have x-ray vision for character. Being married to her
is like standing next to an airport baggage scanner. She came to
the startup world from investment banking, and she has always been
struck both by how consistently successful startup founders turn
out to be good people, and how consistently bad people fail as
startup founders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why?  I think there are several reasons.  One is that being mean
makes you stupid. That's why I hate fights. You never do your best
work in a fight, because fights are not sufficiently general.
Winning is always a function of the situation and the people involved.
You don't win fights by thinking of big ideas but by thinking of
tricks that work in one particular case.  And yet fighting is just
as much work as thinking about real problems. Which is particularly
painful to someone who cares how their brain is used: your brain
goes fast but you get nowhere, like a car spinning its wheels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Startups don't win by attacking. They win by transcending. There
are exceptions of course, but usually the way to win is to race
ahead, not to stop and fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another reason mean founders lose is that they can't get the best
people to work for them. They can hire people who will put up with
them because they need a job. But the best people have other options.
A mean person can't convince the best people to work for him unless
he is super convincing. And while having the best people helps any
organization, it's critical for startups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also a complementary force at work: if you want to build
great things, it helps to be driven by a spirit of benevolence. The startup founders who end up
richest are not the ones driven by money.  The ones driven by money
take the big acquisition offer that nearly every successful startup
gets en route.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/mean.html#f1n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;
The ones who keep going are driven by something
else. They may not say so explicitly, but they're usually trying
to improve the world.  Which means people with a desire to improve
the world have a natural advantage.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/mean.html#f2n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The exciting thing is that startups are not just one random type
of work in which meanness and success are inversely correlated.
This kind of work is the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For most of history success meant control of scarce resources.  One
got that by fighting, whether literally in the case of pastoral
nomads driving hunter-gatherers into marginal lands, or metaphorically
in the case of Gilded Age financiers contending with one another
to assemble railroad monopolies. For most of history, success meant
success at zero-sum games. And in most of them meanness was not a
handicap but probably an advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That is changing. Increasingly the games that matter are not zero-sum.
Increasingly you win not by fighting to get control of a scarce
resource, but by having new ideas and building new things.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/mean.html#f3n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There have long been games where you won by having new ideas. In
the third century BC, Archimedes won by doing that. At least until
an invading Roman army killed him. Which illustrates why
this change is happening: for new ideas to matter, you need a certain
degree of civil order.  And not just not being at war.  You also
need to prevent the sort of economic violence that nineteenth century
magnates practiced against one another and communist countries
practiced against their citizens.  People need to feel that what
they create can't be stolen.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/mean.html#f4n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;4&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That has always been the case for thinkers, which is why this trend
began with them.  When you think of successful people from history
who weren't ruthless, you get mathematicians and writers and artists.
The exciting thing is that their m.o. seems to be spreading.  The
games played by intellectuals are leaking into the real world, and
this is reversing the historical polarity of the relationship between
meanness and success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So I'm really glad I stopped to think about this. Jessica and I
have always worked hard to teach our kids not to be mean.  We
tolerate noise and mess and junk food, but not meanness.  And now
I have both an additional reason to crack down on it, and an
additional argument to use when I do: that being mean makes you
fail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f1n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
I'm not saying all founders who take big acquisition offers
are driven only by money, but rather that those who don't aren't.
Plus one can have benevolent motives for being driven by money — for 
example, to take care of one's family, or to be free to work
on projects that improve the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f2n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
It's unlikely that every successful startup improves the
world.  But their founders, like parents, truly believe they do.
Successful founders are in love with their companies.  And while
this sort of love is as blind as the love people have for one
another, it is genuine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f3n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
&lt;a href="http://startupclass.samaltman.com/courses/lec05"&gt;Peter 
Thiel&lt;/a&gt; would point out that successful founders still
get rich from controlling monopolies, just monopolies they create
rather than ones they capture.  And while this is largely true, it
means a big change in the sort of person who wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f4n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;4&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
To be fair, the Romans didn't mean to kill Archimedes.  The
Roman commander specifically ordered that he be spared. But he got
killed in the chaos anyway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In sufficiently disordered times, even thinking requires
control of scarce resources, because living at all is a scarce
resource.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thanks&lt;/b&gt; to Sam Altman, Ron Conway, Daniel Gackle, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris,
Geoff Ralston, and Fred Wilson for reading drafts of this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
October 2014&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;(This essay is derived from a guest lecture in Sam Altman's &lt;a href="http://startupclass.samaltman.com/"&gt;startup class&lt;/a&gt; at
Stanford.  It's intended for college students, but much of it is
applicable to potential founders at other ages.)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the advantages of having kids is that when you have to give
advice, you can ask yourself "what would I tell my own kids?"  My
kids are little, but I can imagine what I'd tell them about startups
if they were in college, and that's what I'm going to tell you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Startups are very counterintuitive.  I'm not sure why.  Maybe it's
just because knowledge about them hasn't permeated our culture yet.
But whatever the reason, starting a startup is a task where you
can't always trust your instincts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's like skiing in that way.  When you first try skiing and you
want to slow down, your instinct is to lean back.  But if you lean
back on skis you fly down the hill out of control.  So part of
learning to ski is learning to suppress that impulse.  Eventually
you get new habits, but at first it takes a conscious effort.  At
first there's a list of things you're trying to remember as you
start down the hill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Startups are as unnatural as skiing, so there's a similar list for
startups. Here I'm going to give you the first part of it — the things
to remember if you want to prepare yourself to start a startup.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Counterintuitive&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first item on it is the fact I already mentioned: that startups
are so weird that if you trust your instincts, you'll make a lot
of mistakes.  If you know nothing more than this, you may at least
pause before making them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When I was running Y Combinator I used to joke that our function
was to tell founders things they would ignore.  It's really true.
Batch after batch, the YC partners warn founders about mistakes
they're about to make, and the founders ignore them, and then come
back a year later and say "I wish we'd listened."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why do the founders ignore the partners' advice?  Well, that's the
thing about counterintuitive ideas: they contradict your intuitions.
They seem wrong.  So of course your first impulse is to disregard
them.  And in fact my joking description is not merely the curse
of Y Combinator but part of its raison d'etre. If founders' instincts
already gave them the right answers, they wouldn't need us.  You
only need other people to give you advice that surprises you. That's
why there are a lot of ski instructors and not many running
instructors.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/before.html#f1n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can, however, trust your instincts about people.  And in fact
one of the most common mistakes young founders make is not to
do that enough.  They get involved with people who seem impressive,
but about whom they feel some misgivings personally.  Later when
things blow up they say "I knew there was something off about him,
but I ignored it because he seemed so impressive."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you're thinking about getting involved with someone — as a
cofounder, an employee, an investor, or an acquirer — and you
have misgivings about them, trust your gut.  If someone seems
slippery, or bogus, or a jerk, don't ignore it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is one case where it pays to be self-indulgent. Work with
people you genuinely like, and you've known long enough to be sure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Expertise&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second counterintuitive point is that it's not that important
to know a lot about startups.  The way to succeed in a startup is
not to be an expert on startups, but to be an expert on your users
and the problem you're solving for them.
Mark Zuckerberg didn't succeed because he was an expert on startups.
He succeeded despite being a complete noob at startups, because he
understood his users really well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you don't know anything about, say, how to raise an angel round,
don't feel bad on that account.  That sort of thing you can learn
when you need to, and forget after you've done it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In fact, I worry it's not merely unnecessary to learn in great
detail about the mechanics of startups, but possibly somewhat
dangerous.  If I met an undergrad who knew all about convertible
notes and employee agreements and (God forbid) class FF stock, I
wouldn't think "here is someone who is way ahead of their peers."
It would set off alarms.  Because another of the characteristic
mistakes of young founders is to go through the motions of starting
a startup.  They make up some plausible-sounding idea, raise money
at a good valuation, rent a cool office, hire a bunch of people.
From the outside that seems like what startups do.  But the next
step after rent a cool office and hire a bunch of people is: gradually
realize how completely fucked they are, because while imitating all
the outward forms of a startup they have neglected the one thing
that's actually essential: making something people want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Game&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We saw this happen so often that we made up a name for it: playing
house.  Eventually I realized why it was happening.  The reason
young founders go through the motions of starting a startup is
because that's what they've been trained to do for their whole lives
up to that point.  Think about what you have to do to get into
college, for example.  Extracurricular activities, check.  Even in
college classes most of the work is as artificial as running laps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I'm not attacking the educational system for being this way. There
will always be a certain amount of fakeness in the work you do when
you're being taught something, and if you measure their performance
it's inevitable that people will exploit the difference to the point
where much of what you're measuring is artifacts of the fakeness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I confess I did it myself in college. I found that in a lot of
classes there might only be 20 or 30 ideas that were the right shape
to make good exam questions.  The way I studied for exams in these
classes was not (except incidentally) to master the material taught
in the class, but to make a list of potential exam questions and
work out the answers in advance. When I walked into the final, the
main thing I'd be feeling was curiosity about which of my questions
would turn up on the exam.  It was like a game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's not surprising that after being trained for their whole lives
to play such games, young founders' first impulse on starting a
startup is to try to figure out the tricks for winning at this new
game. Since fundraising appears to be the measure of success for
startups (another classic noob mistake), they always want to know what the
tricks are for convincing investors.  We tell them the best way to
&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/convince.html"&gt;convince investors&lt;/a&gt; is to make a startup
that's actually doing well, meaning &lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/growth.html"&gt;growing fast&lt;/a&gt;, and then simply
tell investors so.  Then they want to know what the tricks are for
growing fast.  And we have to tell them the best way to do that is
simply to make something people want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So many of the conversations YC partners have with young founders
begin with the founder asking "How do we..." and the partner replying
"Just..."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why do the founders always make things so complicated?  The reason,
I realized, is that they're looking for the trick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So this is the third counterintuitive thing to remember about
startups: starting a startup is where gaming the system stops
working.  Gaming the system may continue to work if you go to work
for a big company. Depending on how broken the company is, you can
succeed by sucking up to the right people, giving the impression
of productivity, and so on. 
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/before.html#f2n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;
But that doesn't work with startups.
There is no boss to trick, only users, and all users care about is
whether your product does what they want. Startups are as impersonal
as physics.  You have to make something people want, and you prosper
only to the extent you do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dangerous thing is, faking does work to some degree on investors.
If you're super good at sounding like you know what you're talking
about, you can fool investors for at least one and perhaps even two
rounds of funding.  But it's not in your interest to.  The company
is ultimately doomed.  All you're doing is wasting your own time
riding it down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So stop looking for the trick. There are tricks in startups, as
there are in any domain, but they are an order of magnitude less
important than solving the real problem. A founder who knows nothing
about fundraising but has made something users love will have an
easier time raising money than one who knows every trick in the
book but has a flat usage graph. And more importantly, the founder
who has made something users love is the one who will go on to
succeed after raising the money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though in a sense it's bad news in that you're deprived of one of
your most powerful weapons, I think it's exciting that gaming the
system stops working when you start a startup.  It's exciting that
there even exist parts of the world where you win by doing good
work.  Imagine how depressing the world would be if it were all
like school and big companies, where you either have to spend a lot
of time on bullshit things or lose to people who do.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/before.html#f3n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;
I would
have been delighted if I'd realized in college that there were parts
of the real world where gaming the system mattered less than others,
and a few where it hardly mattered at all.  But there are, and this
variation is one of the most important things to consider when
you're thinking about your future.  How do you win in each type of
work, and what would you like to win by doing?
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/before.html#f4n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;4&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;All-Consuming&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That brings us to our fourth counterintuitive point: startups are
all-consuming.  If you start a startup, it will take over your life
to a degree you cannot imagine.  And if your startup succeeds, it
will take over your life for a long time: for several years at the
very least, maybe for a decade, maybe for the rest of your working
life.  So there is a real opportunity cost here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Larry Page may seem to have an enviable life, but there are aspects
of it that are unenviable.  Basically at 25 he started running as
fast as he could and it must seem to him that he hasn't stopped to
catch his breath since.  Every day new shit happens in the Google
empire that only the CEO can deal with, and he, as CEO, has to deal
with it.  If he goes on vacation for even a week, a whole week's
backlog of shit accumulates.  And he has to bear this uncomplainingly,
partly because as the company's daddy he can never show fear or
weakness, and partly because billionaires get less than zero sympathy
if they talk about having difficult lives.  Which has the strange
side effect that the difficulty of being a successful startup founder
is concealed from almost everyone except those who've done it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Y Combinator has now funded several companies that can be called
big successes, and in every single case the founders say the same
thing.  It never gets any easier.  The nature of the problems change.
You're worrying about construction delays at your London office
instead of the broken air conditioner in your studio apartment.
But the total volume of worry never decreases; if anything it
increases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting a successful startup is similar to having kids in that
it's like a button you push that changes your life irrevocably.
And while it's truly wonderful having kids, there are a lot of
things that are easier to do before you have them than after.  Many
of which will make you a better parent when you do have kids. And
since you can delay pushing the button for a while, most people in
rich countries do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yet when it comes to startups, a lot of people seem to think they're
supposed to start them while they're still in college.  Are you
crazy?  And what are the universities thinking?  They go out of
their way to ensure their students are well supplied with contraceptives,
and yet they're setting up entrepreneurship programs and startup
incubators left and right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To be fair, the universities have their hand forced here.  A lot
of incoming students are interested in startups.  Universities are,
at least de facto, expected to prepare them for their careers.  So
students who want to start startups hope universities can teach
them about startups.  And whether universities can do this or not,
there's some pressure to claim they can, lest they lose applicants
to other universities that do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can universities teach students about startups?  Yes and no.  They
can teach students about startups, but as I explained before, this
is not what you need to know.  What you need to learn about are the
needs of your own users, and you can't do that until you actually
start the company.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/before.html#f5n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;5&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;
So starting a startup is intrinsically
something you can only really learn by doing it.  And it's impossible
to do that in college, for the reason I just explained: startups
take over your life.  You can't start a startup for real as a
student, because if you start a startup for real you're not a student
anymore. You may be nominally a student for a bit, but you won't even
be that for long.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/before.html#f6n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;6&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given this dichotomy, which of the two paths should you take?  Be
a real student and not start a startup, or start a real startup and
not be a student?  I can answer that one for you. Do not start a
startup in college.  How to start a startup is just a subset of a
bigger problem you're trying to solve: how to have a good life.
And though starting a startup can be part of a good life for a lot
of ambitious people, age 20 is not the optimal time to do it.
Starting a startup is like a brutally fast depth-first search.  Most
people should still be searching breadth-first at 20.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can do things in your early 20s that you can't do as well before
or after, like plunge deeply into projects on a whim and travel
super cheaply with no sense of a deadline.  For unambitious people,
this sort of thing is the dreaded "failure to launch," but for the
ambitious ones it can be an incomparably valuable sort of exploration.
If you start a startup at 20 and you're sufficiently successful,
you'll never get to do it.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/before.html#f7n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;7&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mark Zuckerberg will never get to bum around a foreign country.  He
can do other things most people can't, like charter jets to fly him
to foreign countries. But success has taken a lot of the serendipity
out of his life. Facebook is running him as much as he's running
Facebook. And while it can be very cool to be in the grip of a
project you consider your life's work, there are advantages to
serendipity too, especially early in life.  Among other things it
gives you more options to choose your life's work from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's not even a tradeoff here. You're not sacrificing anything
if you forgo starting a startup at 20, because you're more likely
to succeed if you wait.  In the unlikely case that you're 20 and
one of your side projects takes off like Facebook did, you'll face
a choice of running with it or not, and it may be reasonable to run
with it.  But the usual way startups take off is for the founders
to &lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/ds.html"&gt;make them&lt;/a&gt; take off, and it's gratuitously
stupid to do that at 20.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Try&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Should you do it at any age?  I realize I've made startups sound
pretty hard.  If I haven't, let me try again: starting a startup
is really hard.  What if it's too hard?  How can you tell if you're
up to this challenge?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The answer is the fifth counterintuitive point: you can't tell. Your
life so far may have given you some idea what your prospects might
be if you tried to become a mathematician, or a professional football
player.  But unless you've had a very strange life you haven't done
much that was &lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/really.html"&gt;like&lt;/a&gt; being a startup founder.
Starting a startup will change you a lot.  So what you're trying
to estimate is not just what you are, but what you could grow into,
and who can do that?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the past 9 years it was my job to predict whether people would
have what it took to start successful startups.  It was easy to
tell how smart they were, and most people reading this will be over
that threshold.  The hard part was predicting how tough and ambitious they would become.  There
may be no one who has more experience at trying to predict that,
so I can tell you how much an expert can know about it, and the
answer is: not much.  I learned to keep a completely open mind about
which of the startups in each batch would turn out to be the stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The founders sometimes think they know. Some arrive feeling sure
they will ace Y Combinator just as they've aced every one of the (few,
artificial, easy) tests they've faced in life so far.  Others arrive
wondering how they got in, and hoping YC doesn't discover whatever
mistake caused it to accept them.  But there is little correlation
between founders' initial attitudes and how well their companies
do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I've read that the same is true in the military — that the
swaggering recruits are no more likely to turn out to be really
tough than the quiet ones. And probably for the same reason: that
the tests involved are so different from the ones in their previous
lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you're absolutely terrified of starting a startup, you probably
shouldn't do it.  But if you're merely unsure whether you're up to
it, the only way to find out is to try.  Just not now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Ideas&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So if you want to start a startup one day, what should you do in
college?  There are only two things you need initially: an idea and
cofounders.  And the m.o. for getting both is the same.  Which leads
to our sixth and last counterintuitive point: that the way to get
startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I've written a whole &lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html"&gt;essay&lt;/a&gt; on this,
so I won't repeat it all here.  But the short version is that if
you make a conscious effort to think of startup ideas, the ideas
you come up with will not merely be bad, but bad and plausible-sounding,
meaning you'll waste a lot of time on them before realizing they're
bad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The way to come up with good startup ideas is to take a step back.
Instead of making a conscious effort to think of startup ideas,
turn your mind into the type that startup ideas form in without any
conscious effort.  In fact, so unconsciously that you don't even
realize at first that they're startup ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not only possible, it's how Apple, Yahoo, Google, and
Facebook all got started.  None of these companies were even meant
to be companies at first.  They were all just side projects.  The
best startups almost have to start as side projects, because great
ideas tend to be such outliers that your conscious mind would reject
them as ideas for companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ok, so how do you turn your mind into the type that startup ideas
form in unconsciously?  (1) Learn a lot about things that matter,
then (2) work on problems that interest you (3) with people you
like and respect.  The third part, incidentally, is how you get
cofounders at the same time as the idea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first time I wrote that paragraph, instead of "learn a lot about
things that matter," I wrote "become good at some technology." But
that prescription, though sufficient, is too narrow.  What was
special about Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia was not that they were
experts in technology.  They were good at design, and perhaps even
more importantly, they were good at organizing groups and making
projects happen.  So you don't have to work on technology per se,
so long as you work on problems demanding enough to stretch you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What kind of problems are those?  That is very hard to answer in
the general case.  History is full of examples of young people who
were working on important problems that &lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/marginal.html"&gt;no
one else&lt;/a&gt; at the time thought were important, and in particular
that their parents didn't think were important.  On the other hand,
history is even fuller of examples of parents who thought their
kids were wasting their time and who were right.  So how do you
know when you're working on real stuff?
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/before.html#f8n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;8&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I know how &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; know.  Real problems are interesting, and I am
self-indulgent in the sense that I always want to work on interesting
things, even if no one else cares about them (in fact, especially
if no one else cares about them), and find it very hard to make
myself work on boring things, even if they're supposed to be
important.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My life is full of case after case where I worked on something just
because it seemed interesting, and it turned out later to be useful
in some worldly way.  &lt;a href="http://ycombinator.com/start.html"&gt;Y
Combinator itself&lt;/a&gt; was something I only did because it seemed
interesting. So I seem to have some sort of internal compass that
helps me out.  But I don't know what other people have in their
heads. Maybe if I think more about this I can come up with heuristics
for recognizing genuinely interesting problems, but for the moment
the best I can offer is the hopelessly question-begging advice that
if you have a taste for genuinely interesting problems, indulging
it energetically is the best way to prepare yourself for a startup.
And indeed, probably also the best way to live.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/before.html#f9n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;9&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But although I can't explain in the general case what counts as an
interesting problem, I can tell you about a large subset of them.
If you think of technology as something that's spreading like a
sort of fractal stain, every moving point on the edge represents
an interesting problem.  So one guaranteed way to turn your mind
into the type that has good startup ideas is to get yourself to the
leading edge of some technology — to cause yourself, as Paul
Buchheit put it, to "live in the future." When you reach that point,
ideas that will seem to other people uncannily prescient will seem
obvious to you.  You may not realize they're startup ideas, but
you'll know they're something that ought to exist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example, back at Harvard in the mid 90s a fellow grad student
of my friends Robert and Trevor wrote his own voice over IP software.
He didn't mean it to be a startup, and he never tried to turn it
into one.  He just wanted to talk to his girlfriend in Taiwan without
paying for long distance calls, and since he was an expert on
networks it seemed obvious to him that the way to do it was turn
the sound into packets and ship it over the Internet. He never did
any more with his software than talk to his girlfriend, but this
is exactly the way the best startups get started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So strangely enough the optimal thing to do in college if you want
to be a successful startup founder is not some sort of new, vocational
version of college focused on "entrepreneurship." It's the classic
version of college as education for its own sake. If you want to
start a startup after college, what you should do in college is
learn powerful things.  And if you have genuine intellectual
curiosity, that's what you'll naturally tend to do if you just
follow your own inclinations.
&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/before.html#f10n"&gt;&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;10&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The component of entrepreneurship that really matters is domain
expertise.  The way to become Larry Page was to become an expert
on search. And the way to become an expert on search was to be
driven by genuine curiosity, not some ulterior motive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At its best, starting a startup is merely an ulterior motive for
curiosity.  And you'll do it best if you introduce the ulterior
motive toward the end of the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So here is the ultimate advice for young would-be startup founders,
boiled down to two words: just learn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f1n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Some founders listen more than others, and this tends to be a
&lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/word.html"&gt;predictor of success&lt;/a&gt;. One of the things I
remember about the Airbnbs during YC is how intently they listened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f2n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
In fact, this is one of the reasons startups are possible.  If
big companies weren't plagued by internal inefficiencies, they'd
be proportionately more effective, leaving less room for startups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f3n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
In a startup you have to spend a lot of time on &lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/schlep.html"&gt;schleps&lt;/a&gt;, but this sort of work is merely
unglamorous, not bogus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f4n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;4&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
What should you do if your true calling is gaming the system?
Management consulting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f5n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;5&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
The company may not be incorporated, but if you start to get
significant numbers of users, you've started it, whether you realize
it yet or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f6n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;6&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
It shouldn't be that surprising that colleges can't teach
students how to be good startup founders, because they can't teach
them how to be good employees either.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The way universities "teach" students how to be employees is to
hand off the task to companies via internship programs.  But you
couldn't do the equivalent thing for startups, because by definition
if the students did well they would never come back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f7n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;7&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Charles Darwin was 22 when he received an invitation to travel
aboard the HMS Beagle as a naturalist.  It was only because he was
otherwise unoccupied, to a degree that alarmed his family, that he
could accept it. And yet if he hadn't we probably would not know
his name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f8n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;8&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Parents can sometimes be especially conservative in this
department.  There are some whose definition of important problems
includes only those on the critical path to med school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f9n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;9&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
I did manage to think of a heuristic for detecting whether you
have a taste for interesting ideas: whether you find known boring
ideas intolerable.  Could you endure studying literary theory, or
working in middle management at a large company?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f10n"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;10&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
In fact, if your goal is to start a startup, you can stick
even more closely to the ideal of a liberal education than past
generations have. Back when students focused mainly on getting a
job after college, they thought at least a little about how the
courses they took might look to an employer.  And perhaps even
worse, they might shy away from taking a difficult class lest they
get a low grade, which would harm their all-important GPA.  Good
news: users &lt;a href="https://paulgraham.com/credentials.html"&gt;don't care&lt;/a&gt; what your GPA
was.  And I've never heard of investors caring either.  Y Combinator
certainly never asks what classes you took in college or what grades
you got in them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Thanks&lt;/b&gt; to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, John Collison, Patrick
Collison, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, Geoff Ralston, and
Fred Wilson for reading drafts of this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</content:encoded>
